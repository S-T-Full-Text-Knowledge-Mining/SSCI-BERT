B	The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory ( GAI ) is a recently developed scale aiming to evaluate symptoms of anxiety in later life.
B	This 20-item scale uses dichotomous answers highlighting non-somatic anxiety complaints of elderly people.
B	The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version GAI ( GAI-BR ) in a sample from community and outpatient psychogeriatric clinic.
M	A mixed convenience sample of 72 subjects was recruited for answering the research protocol.
M	The interview procedures were structured with questionnaires about sociodemographic data , clinical health status , anxiety , and depression previously validated instruments , Mini-Mental State Examination , Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview , and GAI-BR.
M	Twenty-two percent of the sample were interviewed twice for test-retest reliability.
M	For internal consistency analyses , the Cronbach's a test was applied.
M	The Spearman correlation test was applied to evaluate the test-retest GAI-BR reliability.
M	A ROC( receiver operating characteristic ) curve study was made to estimate the GAI-BR area under curve , cut-off points , sensitivity , and specificity for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder diagnosis.
R	The GAI-BR version showed high internal consistency ( Cronbach's alpha = 0.91 ) and strong and significant test-retest reliability ( rho = 0.85 , p < 0.001 ).
R	It also showed moderate and significant correlation with the Beck Anxiety Inventory ( rho = 0.68 , p < 0.001 ) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( rho = 0.61 , p < 0.001 ) showing evidence of concurrent validation.
R	The cut-off point of 13 estimated by ROC curve analyses showed sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 84.6% to detect Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( DSM-IV ).
C	GAI-BR has demonstrated very good psychometric properties and can be a reliable instrument to measure anxiety in Brazilian elderly people.
B	Concepts of affective disorders have not received substantial validation in childhood and adolescence even after the theoretical separation between neurotic and endogenous depression was changed.
B	The aim of this study was to assess differences in children and adolescents with neurotic and endogenous depression according to ICD-9 and depression according to ICD-10 with regard to the severity of different symptoms as well as anamnestic and psychosocial risk factors.
M	Data of 33 and 88 patients ( classified according to ICD-9 and ICD-10 , respectively ) with a confirmed diagnosis of depression were included.
M	In a standardized study protocol , sociodemographic data , family history , psychopathological symptoms and psychosocial and environmental factors were analyzed.
R	Patients diagnosed with endogenous depression more frequently had a positive family history of psychiatric disorders and had more comorbid symptoms in comparison to those with neurotic depression.
R	Group comparisons of the ICD-9 and ICD-10 demonstrated fewer abnormal psychosocial and environmental factors and fewer affective symptoms in the ICD-9 sample.
R	Logistic regression revealed predictors for endogenous depression in the ICD-9 sample and severe depression in the ICD-10 sample.
C	Neurotic depression might represent a subthreshold depression diagnosis compared with endogenous depression.
C	The present study was limited by small and different sample sizes and the fact that dysthymia was not classified within the ICD-10 diagnosis.

B	Differences in breast cancer incidence time trends can result from changes in ascertainment , new diagnostic codes , or possibly changes in underlying risk factors.
M	Female breast cancer incidence data between 1985 and 2004 were obtained from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry.
M	Joinpoint regression was applied to characterize time trends of age-specific , race-specific , and histology-specific breast cancer incidence.
M	Estimated annual percent change ( APC ) was calculated.
M	Spatial analysis was applied to detect spatial clusters of county-specific incidence for breast cancer in Pennsylvania.
R	The age-adjusted incidence of invasive breast carcinoma and breast carcinoma in situ was higher in white women than in black women.
R	Invasive breast carcinoma incidence began to decrease significantly in 2001 ( APC -3.0% ) among white women but has been stable among black women since 1987.
R	Among white women , the age-adjusted incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ increased significantly from 1985 to 1999 but was stable for lobular carcinoma in situ.
R	Among black women , the incidence for both ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ increased significantly over time.
R	For women under the age of 40 , breast carcinoma in situ incidence increased significantly over time ( APC 4.5% and 10.0% in white women and black women , respectively , 1985-2004 ).
R	Young black women had a higher incidence of both invasive breast carcinoma and breast carcinoma in situ compared to young white women.
C	Although the increase in breast carcinoma in situ is partly explained by improved diagnosis and screening , other risk factors should be considered.
C	In addition , factors responsible for higher breast cancer rates among younger black women and women living in urban areas should be carefully assessed.
B	The UK Clinical Aptitude Test ( UKCAT ) was introduced in 2006 as an additional tool for the selection of medical students.
B	It tests mental ability in four distinct domains ( Verbal Reasoning , Quantitative Reasoning , Abstract Reasoning , and Decision Analysis ) , and the results are available to students and admission panels in advance of the selection process.
B	Our first study showed little evidence of any predictive validity for performance in the first two years of the Nottingham undergraduate course.
B	The study objective was to determine whether the UKCAT scores had any predictive value for the later parts of the course , largely delivered via clinical placements.
M	Students entering the course in 2007 and who had taken the UKCAT were asked for permission to use their anonymised data in research.
M	The UKCAT scores were incorporated into a database with routine pre-admission socio-demographics and subsequent course performance data.
M	Correlation analysis was followed by hierarchical multivariate linear regression.
R	The original study group comprised 204/254 ( 80% ) of the full entry cohort.
R	With attrition over the five years of the course this fell to 185 ( 73% ) by Year 5.
R	The Verbal Reasoning score and the UKCAT Total score both demonstrated some univariate correlations with clinical knowledge marks , and slightly less with clinical skills.
R	No parts of the UKCAT proved to be an independent predictor of clinical course marks , whereas prior attainment was a highly significant predictor ( p <0.001 ).
C	This study of one cohort of Nottingham medical students showed that UKCAT scores at admission did not independently predict subsequent performance on the course.
C	Whilst the test adds another dimension to the selection process , its fairness and validity in selecting promising students remains unproven , and requires wider investigation and debate by other schools.
P	Electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes ) could have a multifaceted effect on public health by changing the likelihood that: ( a ) non-smokers and non-users of marijuana subsequently transition to cigarette and marijuana use , respectively , and/or: ( b ) cigarette smokers subsequently quit smoking.
P	We analyzed data from a longitudinal study of Hispanic young adults in Los Angeles , California to determine whether e-cigarette use is associated with subsequent cigarette or marijuana use over a one-year period.
M	Survey data were collected from 1332 Hispanic young adults ( 59% female , mean age = 22.7 years , SD = 0.39 years ) in 2014 and 2015.
M	Logistic regression analyses examined the association between e-cigarette use in 2014 and cigarette/marijuana use in 2015 , controlling for age , sex , and other substance use.
R	In 2014 , prevalence of past-month use was 9% for e-cigarettes , 21% for cigarettes , and 23% for marijuana.
R	Among past-month cigarette nonsmokers in 2014 , those who were past-month e-cigarette users in 2014 were over 3 times more likely to be past-month cigarette smokers in 2015 , compared with those who did not report past-month e-cigarette use in 2014 ( 26% vs. 7% ; OR = 3.32 , 95% CI = 1.55 , 7.10 ).
R	Among past-month marijuana non-users in 2014 , those who were past-month e-cigarette users in 2014 were nearly 2 times more likely to be past-month marijuana users in 2015 ( 24% vs. 12% ;OR = 1.97 , 95% CI = 1.01 , 3.86 ).
R	Among past-month cigarette and marijuana users in 2014 , e-cigarette use in 2014 was not associated with a change cigarette and marijuana use , respectively , in 2015.
C	Among Hispanic young adults , e-cigarettes could increase the likelihood of transitioning from non-user to user of cigarettes or marijuana and was not associated with smoking cessation.

P	The relationship between radiation treatment and adverse effects resulting in changes in appetite was studied in patients with head and neck ( H&N ) cancer.
M	Path analysis was used to evaluate the following factors in 117 patients receiving radiation therapy for H&N cancer: daily fluctuations in saliva production , analgesic use , frequency of oral care , subject characteristics , and appetite.
R	At 20 Gy of radiation , appetite was affected by Brinkman index value , age , and sensitivity to taste ( R( 2 ) = 0.48 , p < 0.001 ) ; at 30 Gy of radiation , appetite was affected by frequency of oral care , xerostomia symptoms , age , sensitivity to taste , and oral mucositis ( R( 2 ) = 0.52 , p < 0.001 ) ; and at 50 Gy of radiation , appetite was affected by low saliva production in the morning , frequency of oral care , xerostomia symptoms , sensitivity to taste , analgesic use , and oral mucositis ( R2 = 0.62 , p < 0.001 ).
C	The results of this study suggest that care taken to avoid a decrease in appetite due to adverse effects of radiation therapy should differ according to the dosage and schedule of radiation therapy.
C	These findings represent important data for health care professionals to understand and support appropriate dietary intake and improved quality of life for H&N cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.

P	This study was designed to identify types of complex-sentence meanings ( i.e. , content ) produced in selected elicitation contexts by typically developing children within 3 different age groups.
P	The research was motivated by the need for additional evidence-based assessments and interventions for children with language disorders.
M	Participants included 3 groups of typically developing children , mean ages 2 ; 8 ( years ; months ; Cohort 1 ) , 3 ; 4 ( Cohort 2 ) , and 4 ; 7 ( Cohort 3 ).
M	Four elicitation contexts distinguished on the basis of degree of spontaneity and the potential for eliciting complex sentences were used: free-play , script-play , elicited description , and story retelling.
M	Tasks within these contexts were presented to each child over two 1-hr sessions.
R	Significant differences were found among the cohorts for proportion of complex-sentence productions overall , across contexts , and across content categories.
R	Significant relationships were found between content and contexts and between adult model and content of the child's following utterance.
C	Findings suggest that children's complex-sentence production changes with development and is sensitive to features of linguistic and nonlinguistic contexts.
C	These data provide evidence for the types of complex-sentence content that may be expected in specified contexts , thus serving as a basis for planning assessment and intervention for children with language disorders.
B	A patient navigation model was implemented to improve breast and cervical cancer screening among women who were homeless in five shelters and shelter clinics in New York City in 2014.
M	Navigation consisted of opt-out screening to eligible women ; cancer health and screening education ; scheduling and following up for screening completion , obtaining , and communicating results to patients and providers ; and care coordination with social services organizations.
R	Women ( n = 162 , aged 21-74 , 58% black ) completed mammogram ( 88% ) and Pap testing ( 83% ) from baselines of 59% and 50% , respectively.
R	There was no association between mental health or substance abuse and screening completion.
R	Adjusted analysis showed a significant association between refusing/missing Pap testing and older age ( odds ratio [ OR] 1.12 , 95% confidence interval [ CI] 1.04-1.20 ) ; independent predictors of mammogram included more pregnancies ( OR 0.57 , 95% CI 0.37-0.88 ) and older age ( OR 0.84 , 95% CI 0.79-0.90 ).
C	Opt-out patient navigation is feasible and effective and may mitigate multilevel barriers to cancer screening among women with unstable housing.
P	The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between tongue-to-palate pressure and the electromyography ( EMG ) measured from the mylohyoid , anterior belly of the digastric , geniohyoid , medial pterygoid , velum , genioglossus , and intrinsic tongue muscles.
M	Seven healthy adults performed tongue-to-palate pressure tasks at known percentages of their maximum pressure while intramuscular EMG was recorded from the muscles stated above.
M	Multiple regression analysis was performed.
R	Predictors of pressure included the posterior fibers of the genioglossus , mylohyoid , anterior belly of digastric , medial pterygoid , and intrinsic tongue.
C	Increasing tongue-to-palate pressure coincides with increased muscle activity.
C	Activation of the floor-of-mouth , tongue , and jaw closing muscles increased tongue-to-palate pressure.
C	These findings support the use of a tongue-press exercise to strengthen floor-of-mouth muscles , tongue , and jaw-closing muscles.
B	Despite the increasing enrollment of adult disabled beneficiaries into Medicaid managed care organizations ( MCOs ) , there is little evidence of its ( hoped for ) effectiveness at reducing Medicaid expenditures.
P	To evaluate the impact of Medicaid MCOs on health care expenditures for adults with disabilities.
M	I employ a repeated observations design comparing individual monthly Medicaid expenditures across beneficiaries who reside in counties with mandatory , voluntary , and no MCOs.
M	County-level Medicaid MCO program status for adults with disabilities was merged with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Area Resource File for 1996-2004.
M	Two-part regression models are used to estimate the probability and level of Medicaid expenditure.
M	Working age Medicaid beneficiaries who receive Supplement Security Income for disability comprise the sample of 1613 individuals.
M	Outcome measures include total and service-specific Medicaid expenditures.
R	On average , total monthly Medicaid expenditures per beneficiary do not differ between FFS and MCO counties although some service-specific spending differs.
R	Relative to FFS counties , average monthly Medicaid spending per beneficiary is higher for prescription medications in voluntary ( $24 ) and mandatory ( $25 ) MCO counties.
R	Average Medicaid monthly spending for other medical care and dental care is $4 to $11 higher per beneficiary in MCO relative to FFS counties.
C	Medicaid MCO programs as implemented are not associated with lower Medicaid spending ; thus , state Medicaid programs should consider additional policy tools to contain health care expenditures in this population.
P	Using a sample of 20 ,445 Dutch twins , this study examined the relationship between speech fluency and attentional regulation in children.
P	A secondary objective was to identify etiological overlap between nonfluency and poor attention using fluency-discordant twin pairs.
M	Three fluency groups were created at age 5 using a parent questionnaire: ( a ) probable stuttering ( PS ; N = 826 ; 4.0% ) , highly nonfluent ( HNF ; N = 547 ; 2.7% ) , and typically fluent ( TF ; N = 19 ,072 ; 93% ).
M	Multiple scales assessing attention , primarily self-regulation/inhibition , were obtained from both parents when children were ages 5 and 7 and from teachers when children were age 7.
R	When compared with the TF controls , both the PS and HNF children received higher ( i.e. , more problematic ) scores on parental attention ratings at both ages ( p < .002 ).
R	Effect sizes were moderate for both groups.
R	Teacher and parent ratings were generally comparable.
R	The discordant co-twin analyses suggested that nonfluency and attention were influenced by potentially overlapping genetic and shared environmental factors.
C	The liability to express both high nonfluency and problems with self-regulation/inhibition may arise from a common set of pathogenic mechanisms.
C	This supports emerging models of stuttering , which propose that poor fluency may be part of a broader network of impaired self-regulatory processes.
B	Ischaemic heart disease ( IHD ) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.
B	Patterns of primary and specialist care in patients leading up to the first hospitalisation for IHD potentially impact on prevention and subsequent outcomes.
B	We investigated the differences in general practice ( GP ) , specialist and emergency department ( ED ) consultations , and associated resource use in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in the two years preceding hospitalisation for IHD.
M	Linked-data were used to identify first IHD admissions for Western Australians aged 25-74 years in 2002-2007.
M	Person-linked GP , specialist and ED consultations were obtained from the Medicare Benefits Schedule ( MBS ) and ED records to assess health care access and costs for the preceding 2 years.
R	Aboriginal people constituted 4.7% of 27 ,230 IHD patients , 3.5% of 1 ,348 ,238 MBS records , and 14% of 33 ,170 ED presentations.
R	Aboriginal ( vs. non-Aboriginal ) people were younger ( mean 50.2 vs 60.5 years ) , more commonly women ( 45.2% vs 28.4% ) , had more comorbidities [Charlson index >= 1 , 35.2% vs 26.3%] , were more likely to have had GP visits ( adjusted rate-ratio 1.07 , 95% CI 1.02-1.12 ) , long/prolonged ( 16.0% vs 11.9% ) consults and non-vocationally registered GP consults ( 17.1% vs 3.2% ) , but less likely to received specialist consults ( mean 1.0 vs 4.1 ).
R	Mean number of urgent/semi-urgent ED presentations in the year preceding the IHD admission was higher in Aboriginal people ( 2.9 vs 1.9 ).
R	Aboriginal people incurred 2.7% of total associated MBS expenditure ( estimated at $59.7 million ).
R	Mean total cost per person was 43.
R	3% lower in Aboriginal patients , with cost differentials being greatest in diabetic and chronic kidney disease patients.
C	Despite being over-represented in urgent/semi-urgent ED presentations and admissions for IHD , Aboriginal people were under-resourced compared with the rest of the population , particularly in terms of specialist care prior to first IHD hospitalisation.
C	The findings underscore the need for better primary and specialist shared care delivery models particularly for Aboriginal people.
B	The current study examined which promising help-seeking factors accounted for unique variance in help-seeking intention among substance-using college students.
B	Participants included 8 ,416 substance-using college students from a USA national sample.
M	Three separate logistic regressions were conducted to predict help-seeking intention among varying categories ( i.e. , marijuana , alcohol , and polysubstance ) of substance-using college students.
R	Tests of the full models against constant only models were statistically significant for all models , which indicated that the predictors collectively distinguished between substance-using college students who intended to seek help and those who did not.
R	Wald criteria indicated that perceived treatment effectiveness , perceived need for psychological help , and perceived knowledge of mental illness made significant unique contributions to help-seeking intention for all three groups.
R	Perceived public stigma was not a significant predictor of help-seeking intention in all models and personal stigma was not a significant predictor among the alcohol-using college students.
C	These findings provide evidenced-based rationale for prioritizing these factors among substance-using college students.
B	Postpartum depression ( PPD ) is considered a major public health problem that conveys risk to mothers and offspring.
B	Yet PPD typically occurs in the context of a lifelong episodic illness , and its putative effects might derive from the child's exposure to other episodes , in pregnancy or later childhood.
B	The aim of the study is to test two hypotheses: ( 1 ) that the effects of PPD on adolescent outcomes are partly explained by antepartum depression ( APD ) and ( 2 ) that the effects of APD and PPD are both explained by later exposure to the mother's depression.
M	A random sample of 178 antenatal patients was drawn from two general medical practices in South London ; 171 gave birth to live infants , and 150 ( 88% ) were assessed at 3 months post partum , with 121 of their offspring ( 81% ) assessed for emotional disorders ( ED ) , disruptive behaviour disorders ( DBD ) and IQ , at 11 and 16 years of age.
R	When APD and subsequent episodes of depression were taken into account , PPD had a significant effect on adolescent IQ , especially for boys , but did not predict psychopathology.
R	ED and DBD in adolescence were predicted by the extent of exposure to maternal depression after 3 months post partum ; a significant effect of APD on ED in girls was accounted for by later exposure to the mother's illness.
R	Mothers' symptoms of anxiety , smoking and alcohol use in pregnancy did not predict adolescent outcomes , once maternal depression was taken into account.
C	Some effects attributed to mothers' mental health problems in pregnancy or post partum may be mediated by cumulative exposure to maternal illness , probably reflecting genetic influence and gene-environment correlation.
C	However , PPD has a direct effect on cognition.
C	Clinicians should endeavour to identify women with depression in pregnancy ( 31% of this sample ) and help them to manage their lifelong illness.
P	The aim of this study was to understand prosecutors' perspectives on the contribution of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners ( SANEs ) to evidence collection and trials in sexual assault cases.
B	Several studies have suggested that a sexual assault case is more likely to progress in the criminal justice system when a SANE conducts the forensic medical examination.
B	However , little is known about how prosecutors perceive SANEs and what they value about SANEs versus other medical professionals.
M	Semistructured interviews , conducted in one jurisdiction with eight assistant district attorneys who prosecute sexual assault cases , included questions about the value of SANEs in evidence collection and trials.
M	Interview transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes and variability among prosecutors.
R	Most prosecutors identified advantages for SANEs in evidence collection , trial preparation , and testimony.
R	Specific advantages cited by one or more prosecutors included superior documentation , thoroughness of the physical examination , better identification of injuries , quality of relationships with patients , professionalism , skill in trial preparation and testifying , and credibility with jurors.
C	These findings help validate SANEs' contribution to the criminal justice response to sexual assault , despite the study's limitations in sample size and inclusion of only one jurisdiction.
C	The study also suggests the value of further education about SANEs for prosecutors who may not have the opportunity to learn about the range of skills SANEs possess.
B	Alzheimer's disease is a very common , progressive and still incurable disease.
B	Future possibilities for its cure lie in the promotion of research that will increase our knowledge of the disorder's causes and lead to the discovery of effective remedies.
B	Such research will necessarily involve individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
B	This raises the controversial issue of whether patients with Alzheimer's disease are competent to give their consent for research participation.
C	We discuss the case of subjects with Alzheimer's disease who may have impaired decision-making capacity and who could be involved in research protocols , taking into consideration aspects of the Italian normative framework , which requires a court-appointed legal representative for patients who are not able to give consent and does not recognise the legal value of advance directives.
C	We show that this normative framework risks preventing individuals with Alzheimer's disease from taking part in research and that a new policy that favours research while promoting respect for patients' well-being and rights needs to be implemented.
C	We believe that concerns about the difficulty of obtaining fully valid consent of patients with Alzheimer's disease should not prevent them from participating in clinical trials and benefiting from scientific progress.
C	Therefore , we argue that the requirement for patients to have a legal representative may not be the best solution in all countries and clinical situations , and suggest promoting the role of patients' family members in the decision-making process.
C	In addition , we outline the possible role of advance directives and ethics committees.
P	While law enforcement officers have the state-sanctioned authority to use force as a way to ensure citizen obedience with the law , research has found that when private citizens evaluate the police as legitimate , they are more likely to comply with legal demands and cooperate with the police.
P	Although procedural justice has shown to be a highly significant predictor of perceived police legitimacy , research has found other correlates of this outcome , including ethnic identity , low self-control and structural economic disadvantage.
P	To date , no study has explored whether strain influences perceptions of the legitimacy of law enforcement.
M	A series of linear regression equations was estimated using survey data collected from a convenience sample of college students to determine the effect of strain on perceived police legitimacy.
R	Even after controlling for procedural justice , strain exerted a negative and statistically significant influence on law enforcement legitimacy evaluations.
C	Police officers are encouraged to interact with citizens in procedurally just manners and to also consider people's strain levels when enforcing the law.

B	Ageing is often associated with multiple long-term health problems influencing older persons' well-being in daily living.
B	It is not unusual that the point of interest in research is often on the management of the actual health problem instead of being holistic and person-centred.
P	To describe the phenomenon of living with long-term health problems that influence daily living , from the older persons' perspective.
M	Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 34 older persons living with long-term health problems.
M	The data were analysed using a Reflected Lifeworld Research ( RLR ) approach , grounded in phenomenology.
R	Life with long-term health problems entails living in a diminishing world.
R	It entails living in uncertainty , not being able to trust one's own ability.
R	The freedom to make decisions of your own is deprived by relatives and health-care providers.
R	Living with long-term health problems entails being dependent on support in daily life and a strive to maintain meaningfulness in daily living.
C	The results address a need for extended individual and holistic guidance and support in living with long-term health problems to increase the older person's sense of well-being and meaning in life.
B	The IMS CORE Diabetes Model ( CDM ) is a widely published and validated simulation model applied in both type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) analyses.
B	Validation to external studies is an important part of demonstrating model credibility.
P	Because the CDM is widely used to estimate long-term clinical outcomes in diabetes patients , the objective of this analysis was to validate the CDM to contemporary outcomes studies , including those with long-term follow-up periods.
M	A total of 112 validation simulations were performed , stratified by study follow-up duration.
M	For long-term results ( >= 15-year follow-up ) , simulation cohorts representing baseline Diabetes Control and Complications Trial ( DCCT ) and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) cohorts were generated and intensive and conventional treatment arms were defined in the CDM.
M	Predicted versus observed macrovascular and microvascular complications and all cause mortality were assessed using the coefficient of determination ( R-2 ) goodness-of-fit measure.
R	Across all validation studies , the CDM simulations produced an R2 statistic of 0.90.
R	for validation studies with a follow-up duration of less than 15 years , R-2 values of 0.90 and 0.88 were achieved for T1DM and T2DM respectively.
R	In T1DM , validating against 30-year outcomes data ( DCCT ) resulted in an R-2 of 0.72.
R	In T2DM , validating against 20-year outcomes data ( UKPDS ) resulted in an R-2 of 0.92.
C	This analysis supports the CDM as a credible tool for predicting the absolute number of clinical events in DCCT- and UKPDS-like populations.
C	With increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide , the CDM is particularly important for health care decision makers , for whom the robust evaluation of health care policies is essential.
B	Health states can be valued by those who currently experience a health state ( experienced health states [EHS] ) or by the general public , who value a set of given health states ( GHS ) described to them.
B	There has been debate over which method is more appropriate when making resource allocation decisions.
P	This article informs this debate by assessing whether differences between these methods have an effect on the mean EQ-5D-3L tariff scores of different patient groups.
M	The European tariff based on GHS valuations was compared with a German EHS tariff.
M	Comparison was made in the context of EQ-5D-3L health states describing a number of diagnosed chronic diseases ( stroke , diabetes , myocardial infarction , and cancer ) taken from the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region population surveys.
M	Comparison was made of both the difference in weighting of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L and differences in mean tariff scores for patient groups.
R	Weighting of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L were found to be systematically different.
R	The EHS tariff gave significantly lower mean scores for most , but not all , patient groups despite tariff scores being lower for 213 of 243 EQ-5D-3L health states using the GHS tariff.
R	Differences were found to vary between groups , with the largest change in difference being 5.45 in the multiple stoke group.
C	The two tariffs have systematic differences that in certain patient groups could drive the results of an economic evaluation.
C	Therefore , the choice as to which is used may be critical when making resource allocation decisions.
B	Cryptomarkets represent an important drug market innovation by bringing buyers and sellers of illegal drugs together in a 'hidden' yet public online marketplace.
B	We ask: How do cryptomarket drug sellers and buyers perceive the risks of detection and arrest , and attempt to limit them?
M	We analyse selected texts produced by vendors operating on the first major drug cryptomarket , Silk Road ( N = 600 ) alongside data extracted from the marketplace discussion forum that include buyer perspectives.
M	We apply Fader's ( 2016 ) framework for understanding how drug dealers operating 'offline' attempt to reduce the risk of detection and arrest: visibility reduction , charge reduction and risk distribution.
R	We characterize drug transactions on cryptomarkets as 'stretched' across time , virtual and physical space , and handlers , changing the location and nature of risks faced by cryptomarket users.
R	The key locations of risk of detection and arrest by law enforcement were found in 'offline' activities of cryptomarket vendors ( packaging and delivery drop-offs ) and buyers ( receiving deliveries ).
R	Strategies in response involved either creating or disrupting routine activities in line with a non-offending identity.
R	Use of encrypted communication was seen as 'good practice' but often not employed.
R	'Drop shipping' allowed some Silk Road vendors to sell illegal drugs without the necessity of handling them.
C	Silk Road participants neither viewed themselves as immune to , nor passively accepting of , the risk of detection and arrest.
C	Rational choice theorists have viewed offending decisions as constrained by limited access to relevant information.
C	Cryptomarkets as 'illicit capital' sharing communities provide expanded and low-cost access to information enabling drug market participants to make more accurate assessments of the risk of apprehension.
C	The abundance of drug market intelligence available to those on both sides of the law may function to speed up innovation in illegal drug markets , as well as necessitate and facilitate the development of law enforcement responses.

P	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychosocial support needs of teenage young adult cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy in Wales.
M	A focus group interview was utilised to encourage dialogue and collect rich data.
M	Transcripts were analysed through open coding and content analysis.
M	Emergent themes in terms of psychosocial tensions were identified and categorised as external stressors and intrinsic anxieties.
R	All participants indicated a desire to maintain their identity as individuals and resume as normal a life as possible throughout the treatment process and beyond.
R	Peer support was deemed as vital to achieving this goal.
R	Participants demonstrated a distinct sense of unity and group cohesion throughout the session with suggestions that they considered themselves to be very different from what they thought of as 'usual cancer patients'.
R	A range of information was offered prior to radiotherapy however there was variation in the efficacy of this provision between centres.
R	At variance with literature , issues related to body image were not overtly demonstrated as significant.
R	Support services provided by external organisations were not being signposted.
C	Psychosocial support is vital to the psychological recovery and wellbeing of young adult cancer patients.
C	Findings suggest that issues related to peer support and age appropriate services and information are not being addressed within current service provision.
C	Key staff within radiotherapy should be identified to ensure that the specific needs of this distinct patient group are met.

B	To determine differences in positive PTSD screenings and symptom presentation by race/ethnicity and gender for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
M	We conducted a retrospective analysis using existing records from Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who enrolled in VA care , received a post-deployment PTSD diagnosis , initiated mental health outpatient treatment between 10/01/07 and 12/31/11 , and had a PTSD screen result at the start of treatment ( N=79 ,938 ).
M	PTSD outcomes were measured using the PC-PTSD and PCL.
R	At treatment initiation , differences in race/ethnicity and gender were found for PTSD screens and PTSD symptoms.
R	Compared to their white counterparts , Asian/Pacific Islander ( A/PI ) women and black men were more likely to screen positive for PTSD ( adjusted ORs =1.42 and 1.17 , ps =.04 and <.0001 , respectively ) and endorse all measured symptoms ( adjusted ORs =1.09 to 1.66 , ps <=.000-.04 ) except avoidance for A/PI women and hyperarousal for black men ; A/PI men were less likely to endorse hyperarousal ( adjusted OR=.88 , p =.04 ) and did not differ otherwise ; and black women did not differ from their white counterparts.
R	Additional differences in PTSD symptom presentation by race/ethnicity and gender were found.
C	The current study utilized administrative data and was cross-sectional.
C	The results may not be generalizable to veterans from other service eras.
C	PTSD screens differ by race/ethnicity and gender , and further by PTSD symptoms , which can influence initiation and planning of PTSD treatment.
C	Awareness of such differences may aid in detecting PTSD to provide care for diverse veterans.

B	Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a prevalent , life-complicating illness associated with psychological distress.
B	Interventions to manage the psychological challenges of living with AF are needed.
B	Evidence suggests that illness perceptions , coping strategies , and symptoms that contribute to psychological distress may be modified by psychoeducational interventions to reduce psychological distress.
B	However , little is known about how illness perceptions , coping strategies , and symptoms contribute to psychological distress in patients with AF.
P	The aim of this correlational study guided by Levethal's Common Sense Model of Self-regulation was to identify the extent to which illness perceptions , coping strategies , symptom frequency , and symptom severity contributed to psychological distress in patients with recurrent symptomatic AF.
P	The contribution of these factors was considered with respect to the effects of gender , age , type of AF , and time since AF diagnosis.
M	Participants ( n = 207 ; 56% male ; 64.2 +/- 12.3 years old ) completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised , the COPE Inventory , the Symptom Checklist-Frequency and Severity , and the Profile of Mood States.
M	Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression.
R	Illness perceptions contributed most to psychological distress , followed by coping strategies and symptom frequency.
R	Illness perceptions explained the largest portion of the total variance for the following: Tension-Anxiety , 44/56% ; Depression-Dejection , 38/50% ; Fatigue-Inertia , 43/53% ; Confusion-Bewilderment , 41/49% ; Vigor-Activity , 24/35% ; and Total Mood Disturbance , 47/63%.
R	Illness perceptions of AF as having serious consequences , a psychological cause , and perceived poor understanding of AF together contributed more ( .47 ) to Total Mood Disturbance than did coping by focusing on emotion ( .08 ) or symptom frequency ( .06 ).
C	Illness perceptions are important contributors to psychological distress in patients with AF.
C	Assessment of patients' illness perceptions may reveal those that increase the risk for psychological distress.
C	Research is warranted to evaluate interventions to modify psychological cause and consequence beliefs and to promote understanding of AF.
B	Emerging research suggests technology-facilitated crisis services are a promising method to support young people during child maltreatment disclosure.
B	Little is known about how employees/volunteers respond to child maltreatment disclosure in these platforms and how they may support young victims through the disclosure process.
P	We sought to determine how crisis counselors respond to child maltreatment disclosures using a content analysis of all conversations within a text-based crisis organization that resulted in a mandatory report.
M	We conducted an iterative team-based content analysis of 244 conversations ( 24 ,730 text messages ) between a young person and a crisis counselor from an anonymous text-based crisis service.
M	All conversations included in the sample resulted in a mandatory report to child protective services.
R	There were two crucial points in maltreatment disclosure conversations.
R	The first occurred immediately after the disclosure.
R	At this point , crisis counselors most often provided sympathy and affirmation.
R	The second crucial point after disclosure was the discussion of mandatory reporting.
R	In many cases , crisis counselors confirmed both parties understood mandatory reporting and encouraged young people to consider the repercussions of their decision to share identifiable information that would permit a mandatory report.
C	Understanding how crisis counselors responded to young people in one text-based crisis service , particularly characteristics of well-received conversations , may inform the policies and processes for other organizations.
C	Continued exploration of crisis text-based services may improve the disclosure process for young victims.
P	The landscape of education loan repayment programs for health care professionals has been turbulent in recent years , with doubling of the funding for the National Health Service Corps ( NHSC ) and cuts in funding for some states programs.
P	We sought to understand how this turbulence is being felt within the state offices involved in recruiting clinicians to rural and urban underserved communities.
M	We conducted key informant telephone interviews with staff of state offices of rural health , primary care organizations , and/or related organizations within 28 diverse states to answer questions about perceived changes and interplay among solely state-funded loan repayment programs , joint state-federal programs , and the NHSC federal program.
M	Interviews were transcribed , formally analyzed , and key issues summarized.
R	Informants reported that solely state-funded and joint state-federal loan repayment programs are greatly valued for their ability to target a state's particular needs and to complement the NHSC federal program.
R	However , budgets for state programs have been threatened , reduced , or eliminated entirely in many cases.
R	All informants positively perceived the NHSC's recent growth and changes , which they feel are helping fill important workforce needs for their states.
R	Nevertheless , the much larger NHSC federal program now competes with some states programs for clinicians and service sites ; states programs are pushed to adjust their operations to maintain a unique niche.
C	States key recruiters lament reductions in funding for states loan repayment programs , and welcome the NHSC's recent growth and changes.
C	Better coordination is needed to minimize competition and maximize complementarity between state and federal programs.
B	This study was done to determine whether physical activity at baseline is independently associated with musculoskeletal pain and fulfilling one's physical role over 3 subsequent years.
M	Our research involved a 3-year longitudinal study of over 2400 community-dwelling , midlife women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation ( SWAN ).
M	Measurements included baseline physical activity using the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan Activity Survey and SF-36 role-physical and bodily pain indices at each of 3 annual follow-up visits.
R	Each 1-point increase on the physical activity score was associated with a 7% greater likelihood of a high role-physical score ( 95% CI = 1.02-1.13 ) and a 10% greater likelihood of a low bodily pain score ( 95% CI = 1.04-1.17 ) after adjusting for age , race , menopausal status , educational level , body mass index , depressive symptoms , smoking , and chronic medical conditions.
R	The association between physical activity level and role-physical score was eliminated in the fully adjusted model after adjustment for pain level in post hoc analysis [OR = 1.04( 95% CI = 0.98-1.09 )].
C	This study demonstrates that women who are more physically active at midlife experience less bodily pain over time regardless of menopausal status , sociodemographics , and medical conditions.
C	Higher physical activity level positively impacts fulfilling one's physical role ; however , this is mediated by pain level.
B	Physical activity ( PA ) practice has been inversely associated to body fat ( BF ) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity.
B	The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of PA and BF in adolescence.
M	The review includes 18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed database , comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014.
M	Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded.
R	Among the outcomes analyzed , waist circumference , skinfolds , and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified.
R	Questionnaires were the more predominant way to evaluate PA.
R	Most studies showed that PA promotes a protective effect against a higher BF gain.
C	It was concluded that PA has a protective effect against BF with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed ; higher intensity PA leads to a greater effect against BF gain in both genders ; and the maintenance or increase of PA level on BF observed through analysis of change in PA level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between PA and BF.
P	The purpose of the study was to explore the experience of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
B	Never has the world experienced such extreme devastation as with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Japan , in August 1945.
B	Although significant quantitative research has been completed about the medical effects following radiation , the literature lacks qualitative exploration from a holistic health perspective.
M	This was a qualitative descriptive study , using methods of narrative analysis , oral history and ethnography.
M	The sample for this research included eight individuals who were exposed to the atomic bombings in Japan and currently reside in the United States.
R	Findings provide insight to the resilience that the survivors exhibited immediately following the bomb , as well as throughout the 65 years following the event.
R	From ethnographic data and interviews with survivors , a thematic structure was developed that depicts the essential elements of the atomic bomb experience.
R	Two ways of being in the world followed the bombing: surviving and thriving , with resilience serving as a lever , allowing for fluid movement over time across the continuum.
R	Individuals experiencing surviving exhibited anxiety about their personal and family members' health , expressed mistrust , and felt a stigma associated with being a survivor.
R	For those who were thriving , peace activism , overcoming and forgiveness were typically displayed.
C	Findings from this study add to the disaster nursing literature and highlight the role resilience plays in the atomic bomb survivors' life perspective.
P	The purpose of this study is to investigate the structure and measurement properties of the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure ( ACOM ) , a patient-reported outcome measure of communicative functioning for persons with aphasia.
M	Three hundred twenty-nine participants with aphasia responded to 177 items asking about communicative functioning.
M	The data were analyzed using a categorical item factor analysis approach.
M	Validity of ACOM scores on the basis of their convergence with performance-based , clinician-reported , and surrogate-reported assessments of communication was also assessed.
R	Fifty-nine items that obtained adequate fit to a modified bifactor measurement model and functioned similarly across several demographic and clinical subgroupings were identified.
R	The factor model estimates were transformed to item response theory graded response model parameters , and the resulting score estimates showed good precision and moderately strong convergence with other measures of communicative ability and functioning.
R	A free software application for administration and scoring of the ACOM item bank is available from the first author.
C	The ACOM provides reliable measurement of patient-reported communicative functioning in aphasia.
C	The results supported the validity of ACOM scores insofar as ( a ) factor analyses provided support for a coherent measurement model , ( b ) items functioned similarly across demographic and clinical subgroups , and ( c ) scores showed good convergence with measures of related constructs.
P	There is uncertainty as to which knee angle during a squat jump ( SJ ) produces maximal jump performance.
P	Importantly , understanding this information will aid in determining appropriate ratios for assessment and monitoring of the explosive characteristics of athletes.
M	This study compared SJ performance across different knee angles-90 degrees , 100 degrees , 110 degrees , 120 degrees , 130 degrees , and a self-selected depth-for jump height and other kinetic characteristics.
M	For comparison between SJ and an unconstrained dynamic movement , participants also performed a countermovement jump from a self-selected depth.
M	Thirteen participants ( M-age = 25.4 +/- 3.5 years , M-height = 1.8 +/- 0.06m , M-weight = 79.8 +/- 9.5 kg ) were recruited and tested for their SJ performance.
R	In the SJ , maximal jump height ( 35.4 +/- 4.6 cm ) was produced using a self-selected knee angle ( 98.7 +/- 11.2 degrees ).
R	Differences between 90 degrees , 100 degrees , and self-selected knee angles for jump height were trivial ( ES +/- 90% CL = 90 degrees-100 degrees 0.23 +/- 0.12 , 90 degrees-SS -0.04 +/- 0.12 , 100 degrees-SS -0.27 +/- 0.20 ; 0.5-2.4 cm ) and not statistically different.
R	Differences between all other knee angles for jump height ranged from 3.8 +/- 2.0 cm ( mean +/- 90% CL ) to 16.6 +/- 2.2 cm.
R	A similar outcome to jump height was observed for velocity , force relative to body weight , and impulse for the assessed knee angles.
C	For young physically active adult men , the use of a self-selected depth in the SJ results in optimal performance and has only a trivial difference to a constrained knee angle of either 90 degrees or 100 degrees.
B	The Association of American Medical Colleges reports continued low rates of female faculty as professors and in leadership positions.
B	While attrition and discrimination have both been proposed as explanations , recent literature has suggested that women's professional motivations , ingrained behavior , and perceptions of organizational support may also play a role.
M	The authors employed a series of scales informed by the turnover theory ( which predicts intent to leave an organization ) , previously validated and used in business and engineering studies , but rarely used in academic medicine.
M	The authors proposed and tested a multiple regression model to assess predictors ( role strain , work-life balance , and organizational climate ) for three outcome variables: seeking promotion , seeking leadership , and intent to leave.
R	Survey results from 614 faculty members indicated that gender significantly influenced both promotion and leadership seeking , but not intent to leave.
R	Perceived work-family conflict was negatively correlated with leadership seeking for women , but not for men.
R	Positive views of organizational support and commitment were associated with promotion seeking and persistence for all participants.
R	Role strain was positively correlated with desire for promotion and leadership , as well as with intent to leave.
C	Female faculty may not be leaning in to promotion and leadership roles because of increased role conflict , work-life concerns , and organizational factors ; this seems to be more of a factor for female clinical rather than research faculty.
C	Work-family conflict affects male and female faculty differently and should be addressed in efforts to retain faculty and to remove barriers for female faculty seeking leadership opportunities.
B	While research indicates elevated behavioural and emotional problems in children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and decreased well-being in their parents , studies do not typically separate out the contribution of ASD from that of associated intellectual disabilities ( ID ).
B	We investigated child behavioural and emotional problems , and maternal mental health , among cases with and without ASD and ID in a large population-representative sample.
M	Cross-sectional comparison of child behavioural and emotional problems and maternal mental health measures among 18 ,415 children ( 5 to 16 years old ) , of whom 47 had an ASD , 51 combined ASD with ID , 590 had only ID , and the remainder were the comparison group with no ASD or ID.
R	The prevalence of likely clinical levels of behavioural and emotional problems was highest among children with ASD ( with and without ID ).
R	After controlling for age , gender , adversity , and maternal mental health , the presence of ASD and ID significantly and independently increased the odds for hyperactivity symptoms , conduct , and emotional problems.
R	Emotional disorder was more prevalent in mothers of children with ASD ( with or without ID ).
R	The presence of ASD , but not ID , significantly increased the odds for maternal emotional disorder.
R	As has been found in previous research , positive maternal mental health was not affected by the presence of ASD or ID.
C	ASD and ID are independent risk factors for behavioural and emotional problems.
C	ASD ( but not ID ) is positively associated with maternal emotional disorder.
C	Approaches to diagnosing hyperactivity and conduct problems in children with ASD may need to be reconsidered.
B	Although adolescent substance use can have direct effects on asthma symptoms and interact with medications used to treat asthma , no validated health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) instrument exists for adolescents 17 to 19 years of age with asthma.
P	The American Academy of Pediatric's HRQL instrument , the Child Health Survey for Asthma ( CHSA )-Child version , was modified with a substance use subscale to address outcomes specific to adolescents ages 17 to 19 years with asthma.
M	Two cohorts ( N = 70 ) were recruited for instrument testing at pediatric primary care practices and two university clinics.
M	A small methodological study with 24 adolescents was conducted to obtain initial support of the psychometric properties for the CHSA-Teen version at baseline , day 14 , and day 16.
M	A follow-up study included 46 teens to provide further support.
R	The psychometric properties of the CHSA-Teen version were good and comparable with the CHSA-Child version for feasibility , reliability , and validity.
C	Health care providers need to be aware of each adolescent's substance use to personalize counseling related to asthma medications.
P	The purpose of this study was to characterize the verbal memory limitations of young adults with language learning disability ( LLD ).
M	Sixteen young adults with LLD and 34 age- and education-matched controls with typical language participated in a Deese-Roediger-McDermott ( DRM ; Deese , 1959 ; Roediger & McDermott , 1995 ) list recall experiment.
M	Participants listened to 12-item word lists that converged on a nonpresented critical item ( e.g. , rain ) semantically ( umbrella , drench , weather , hail ) , phonologically ( train , main , ran , wren ) , or dually in a hybrid list ( umbrella , train , drench , main ) and recalled words in no particular order.
M	Group comparisons were made on veridical recall ( i.e. , words that were presented ) and false recall of nonpresented critical items.
M	Recall performance was analyzed by list type and list position to examine potential differences in the quality of memorial processes.
R	The LLD group produced fewer veridical recalls than the controls.
R	Both groups demonstrated list type and list position effects in veridical recall.
R	False recall of the critical items was comparable in the 2 groups and varied by list type in predictable ways.
C	Young adults with LLD have verbal memory limitations characterized by quantitatively low levels of accurate recall.
C	Qualitative patterns of recall are similar to those of unaffected peers.
C	Therefore , the memory problem is characterized by limited capacity ; memorial processes appear to be intact.
B	Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) is common among people with asthma , but its association with asthma morbidity remains unexplored.
B	This study examined cross-sectional associations between GAD and asthma control , quality of life , and self-efficacy.
M	Seven hundred ninety-four adults with confirmed asthma were recruited from the outpatient clinic of a university hospital.
M	Patients underwent a sociodemographic and medical history interview ( to assess health service use and medications ) , followed by a brief psychiatric interview ( Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders ) to assess GAD.
M	Patients completed questionnaires assessing asthma control , quality of life , and asthma self-efficacy and underwent spirometry.
M	General linear models and logistic regression were used to assess associations between GAD and asthma morbidity measures , adjusting for covariates.
R	GAD affected 4% of the sample.
R	The analyses revealed significant associations between GAD and worse overall asthma control ( beta = 0.62 , standard error [SE] = 0.18 , p < .001 ) , increased bronchodilator use ( beta = 10.60 , SE = 2.64 , p < .001 ) , worse asthma quality of life ( beta = -0.91 , SE = 0.23 , p < .001 ) , and worse asthma self-efficacy ( beta = -59.56 , SE = 13.59 , p < .001 ) after the adjustment for covariates.
R	Separate sensitivity analyses including major depressive disorder and asthma self-efficacy as additional covariates rendered many of these associations nonsignificant.
R	There were no associations between GAD and emergency visits or hospitalizations.
C	GAD is associated with worse asthma morbidity independent of age , sex , smoking , and asthma severity ; however , comorbid major depressive disorder and low asthma self-efficacy may account for many of these associations.
C	Only breathlessness and the frequency of bronchodilator use were uniquely associated with GAD.
C	Future research should examine whether treatment of GAD can affect asthma outcomes.
B	Female doctors in Hungary have worse indicators of physical and mental health compared with other professional women.
B	We aimed to cast light on possible indicators of mental health , workload , and burnout of female physicians.
M	Two time-points ( T ) were compared , in 2003 ( T1 n = 408 ) and 2013 ( T2 n = 2414 ) , based on two nationally representative surveys of female doctors , and comparison made with data from other professional control groups.
M	Independent samples t test or chi-squared test was used both for the two time-point comparison and the comparison between the index and the control groups.
M	The background factors of sleep disorders and burnout were assessed by binary logistic regression analysis.
R	No significant differences in the rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and attempts were detected between the 2003 and 2013 cohorts , but the prevalence of sleep disorders increased.
R	The workload increased , and there was less job satisfaction in 2013 than in 2003 , coupled to more stressful or difficult work-related situations.
R	The personal accomplishment component of burnout significantly decreased in line with the declining work-related satisfaction.
R	Compared to the professional control groups , the prevalence of depressive symptoms , suicide attempts , and sleep disorders was higher among female physicians at both time-points.
R	The number of workplaces , frequency of work-related stressful situations , and intensive role conflict was associated with sleep disorders and decreased personal accomplishment.
C	In comparison with the other professional groups , female doctors had worse mental health indicators with regard to depression , suicidal ideas , and sleep disorders both in 2003 and 2013 while within professional strata the changes seemed to be less.
C	Increasing workload had a clear impact on sleep disorders and the personal accomplishment dimension of burnout.
P	The current investigation examined individual differences in route-learning strategies and their relative demands on visuospatial versus verbal working memory ( WM ) resources in virtual environments.
B	Learning new routes is a resource-demanding activity that must often be carried out in conjunction with other concurrent tasks.
B	Virtual environments ( VEs ) are increasingly being used for training and research , pointing to the importance of determining the strategies people use to learn routes in these environments.
M	Participants classified as having good or poor sense of direction ( SOD ) attempted to learn novel routes while concurrently performing either a verbal ( articulatory suppression ) or a visuospatial ( tapping ) WM interference task.
R	Different navigational strategies were observed in each SOD group.
R	Individuals with poor SOD relied more heavily on verbal rather than visuospatial WM resources , as evidenced by greater disruption to route-learning performance from the articulatory suppression task relative to the tapping task.
R	Conversely , individuals with good SOD exhibited more route-learning disruption from the tapping task , suggesting a greater reliance on visuospatial WM resources.
C	Individuals differ from one another in the strategies they use and the WM resources they tap-verbal or visuospatial-to learn routes in VEs.
C	Self-report measures can be used as indices of such individual differences in navigational strategy use in VE tasks.
C	Assessing SOD and associated WM resources have implications for targeted training for navigation in VEs and for the design of in-vehicle navigation systems.
B	The increasing availability of massive administrative data sets linking postsecondary enrollees with postcollege earnings records has stimulated a wealth of new research on the returns to college and has accelerated state and federal efforts to hold institutions accountable for students' labor market outcomes.
B	Many of these new research and policy efforts rely on state databases limited to postsecondary enrollees who work in the same state postcollege , with limited information regarding family background and precollege ability.
P	In this article , we use recent waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to provide new , nationally representative , nonexperimental estimates of the returns to degrees , as well as to assess the possible limitations of single-state , administrative data-based estimates.
M	To do this , we explore the sensitivity of estimated returns to college , by testing different sample restrictions , inclusion of different sets of covariates , and alternative ways of treating out-of-state earnings to approximate the real-world limitations of state administrative databases.
R	We find that failure to control for measures of student ability leads to upward bias , while limiting the sample to college enrollees only leads to an understatement of degree returns.
R	On net , these two biases roughly balance out , suggesting that administrative data-based estimates may reasonably approximate true returns.
C	We conclude with a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of survey versus administrative data for estimating returns to college as well as implications for research and policy efforts based upon single-state administrative databases.
B	Students in biomedical disciplines require understanding of normal and abnormal microscopic appearances of human tissues ( histology and histopathology ).
B	For this purpose , practical classes in these disciplines typically use virtual microscopy , viewing digitised whole slide images in web browsers.
B	To enhance engagement , tools have been developed to enable individual or collaborative annotation of whole slide images within web browsers.
B	To date , there have been no studies that have critically compared the impact on learning of individual and collaborative annotations on whole slide images.
M	Junior and senior students engaged in Pathology practical classes within Medical Science and Medicine programs participated in cross-over trials of individual and collaborative annotation activities.
M	Students' understanding of microscopic morphology was compared using timed online quizzes , while students' perceptions of learning were evaluated using an online questionnaire.
R	For senior medical students , collaborative annotation of whole slide images was superior for understanding key microscopic features when compared to individual annotation ; whilst being at least equivalent to individual annotation for junior medical science students.
R	Across cohorts , students agreed that the annotation activities provided a user-friendly learning environment that met their flexible learning needs , improved efficiency , provided useful feedback , and helped them to set learning priorities.
R	Importantly , these activities were also perceived to enhance motivation and improve understanding.
C	Collaborative annotation improves understanding of microscopic morphology for students with sufficient background understanding of the discipline.
C	These findings have implications for the deployment of annotation activities in biomedical curricula , and potentially for postgraduate training in Anatomical Pathology.
B	Although ethics consultation has been introduced to clinical practice for many years , the results of empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of ethics consultation are still controversial.
B	The design of randomised controlled trials is considered the best research design to evaluate the effect of a clinical practice on the outcomes of interests.
B	In order to understand the effects of ethics consultation , we conducted this search for studies with the design of randomised controlled trials to evaluate ethics consultation.
P	To provide an integrated review of studies with the design of randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of ethics consultation.
M	PubMed was used to search for studies using the randomised controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of ethics consultation.
M	The search term used was "ethics consultation''.
M	The selection criterion was limited to "randomised controlled trial''.
R	Four articles that met both search criteria were retrieved.
R	One of these articles reported a study that did not actually use the design of a randomised controlled trial and is excluded from the following discussion.
C	To apply randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of ethics consultation is extremely difficult as long as two issues are not resolved: the standardisation of ethics consultation and a placebo for ethics consultation to eliminate the placebo effect.
C	Thus , the results generated by the design of randomised controlled trials are always problematic.
C	Furthermore , as long as the two issues exist , the results generated by the design of quantitative research methods always pose problems.
B	Baseline severity is a crucial moderator of trial outcomes in adult depression , with the advantage of antidepressants over placebo increasing as severity increases.
B	However , this relationship has not been examined in late life depression.
M	PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , PsycINFO , and Cochrane were searched for studies published through September 2014.
M	Randomized , acute phase , and double-blind studies comparing an antidepressant group with a placebo group in depressed elderly patients were included.
R	Nineteen studies met all inclusion criteria.
R	Within group effect sizes revealed significant improvement in antidepressant groups ( g=1.35 , p < .000 ) , as well as in placebo groups ( g=.96 , p < .000 ).
R	Change in depressive symptoms assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) was moderated by baseline severity in antidepressant groups ( Z=2.67 , p = .008 ) and placebo groups ( Z=4.46 , p < .000 ).
R	However , this would be expected as a result of regression toward the mean , and mean differences between groups did not increase ( r=.19 , p=.469 ) as a function of baseline severity.
C	Limited to published data and information was only analyzed at the level of treatment groups.
C	Baseline severity was not associated with an antidepressant-placebo difference and placebo responses are large in the treatment of depressed elderly people.
C	We propose a stepwise approach , i.e. , to initially offer elderly depressed patients psychosocial interventions and only consider antidepressants if patients do not respond.

P	Although psychopathy is characterized by amoral behavior , literature on the association between psychopathy and moral judgment pattern is mixed.
P	Recent evidence suggests that this may be due to the moderation effect of anxiety ( Koenigs , Kruepke , Zeier , & Newman , 2011 ).
P	The current study aims to examine the psychopathy-utilitarian judgment association in college students.
M	In this study , a group of 302 college students completed a moral judgment test involving hypothetical dilemmas.
M	Their psychopathic traits were assessed by the Psychopathic Personality Inventory - Short Form ( PPI-SF ) ( Lilienfeld & Andrews , 1996 ).
R	Individuals with higher psychopathic traits were more likely to make utilitarian responses to moral dilemmas.
R	Furthermore , the association between utilitarian responses and psychopathy was more salient for the behavioral factor of psychopathy ( PPI-II ) , and this association was mediated by self-reported aggression.
R	However , the moderating effect of anxiety was not found.
C	These results build upon work on utilitarian moral judgment in psychopathic individuals in a non-incarcerated , non-institutionalized sample , and have important implications for the behavioral correction system.

B	Taiwan has experienced a marked increase in the suicide rate in the last decade.
B	However , the socioeconomic burden and impact to the community has not been adequately assessed.
P	This study aimed to estimate the social and economic burden of premature mortality from suicide in Taiwan in 1997-2007.
M	The suicide rate , potential years of life lost ( PYLL ) , and present value of lifetime earnings ( PVLE ) by sex and age groups in 1997-2007 were calculated.
M	The contribution of each suicide method to PYLL for each age group was also assessed.
R	Using the PYLL calculations , suicide had become the third leading cause of death in Taiwan in 2007 , compared to its ninth position in terms of absolute numbers.
R	Furthermore , the PYLL was associated with an estimated NTD ( New Taiwan Dollars ) 32.5 billion of lost earnings in 2007.
R	The increase in PYLL and PVLE from suicide was highest in middle-aged men ( aged 25-59 years ).
R	Charcoal burning suicide accounted for most of the increase in PYLL in the middle-aged group in the past decade.
C	The loss of life in middle-aged males contributes disproportionately to the social and economic burden of suicide in Taiwan.
C	Suicide intervention effort should target this high-risk population.
B	The relationship between obesity and screening mammography adherence has been examined previously , yet few studies have investigated obesity as a potential mediator of timely follow-up of abnormal ( Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BIRADS-0] ) mammography results in minority and medically underserved patients.
M	We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 35 women who did not return for follow-up >6 months from index abnormal mammography and 41 who returned for follow-up <= 6 months in Nashville , Tennessee.
M	Patients with a BIRADS-0 mammography event in 2003-2004 were identified by chart review.
M	Breast cancer risk factors were collected by telephone interview.
M	Multivariate logistic regression was performed on selected factors with return for diagnostic follow-up.
R	Obesity and gynecological history were significant predictors of abnormal mammography resolution.
R	A significantly higher frequency of obese women delayed return for mammography resolution compared with nonobese women ( 64.7% vs. 35.3% ).
R	A greater number of hysterectomized women returned for diagnostic follow-up compared with their counterparts without a hysterectomy ( 77.8% vs. 22.2% ).
R	Obese patients were more likely to delay follow-up >6 months ( adjusted OR 4.09 , p=0.02 ).
R	Conversely , hysterectomized women were significantly more likely to return for timely mammography follow-up <= 6 months ( adjusted OR 7.95 , p=0.007 ).
C	Study results suggest that weight status and gynecological history influence patients' decisions to participate in mammography follow-up studies.
C	Strategies are necessary to reduce weight-related barriers to mammography follow-up in the healthcare system including provider training related to mammography screening of obese women.
B	Treatment of comorbid chronic disease , such as depression , in people living with HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) increasingly falls to HIV treatment providers.
B	Guidance in who will best respond to depression treatment and which patient-centered symptoms are best to target is limited.
M	Bivariable analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios for associations between baseline demographic , mental health-related , and HIV-related factors on time to first depression remission among PLWHA enrolled in a randomized trial of measurement-based antidepressant management.
M	Time-updated factors also were analyzed at time of antidepressant ( AD ) initiation/adjustment and 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment.
R	Baseline comorbid depression and anxiety ; comorbid depression , anxiety and substance abuse ; and generalized anxiety disorder predicted a slower time to first remission.
R	Being on ART but non adherent , having panic disorder , having a history of a major depressive episode , or having been in HIV care for > 10 years prior to study initiation predicted a faster time to first remission.
R	Sleep difficulty or fatigue at the time of AD initiation/adjustment predicted a slower time to remission.
R	In non-remitters at 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment , sleep difficulty , anxiety , and fatigue each predicted a slower time to remission.
C	Remission was determined by PHQ-9 scores , not diagnostic criteria.
C	The results may apply only to depression recovery in this particular model of treatment.
C	We conducted only exploratory analyses to determine magnitude of effects.
C	Baseline comorbid anxiety with or without substance abuse predicts slower time to depression remission among PLWHA treated in HIV clinics.
C	Targeting anxiety or fatigue at the time of AD initiation/adjustment or sleep difficulty , anxiety , and fatigue at 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment could shorten time to depression remission in this model.

P	To provide a historical review on the evolution of contemporary Chinese nursing unit design and contextual factors that drive the design and changes.
B	China is undergoing a major healthcare construction boom.
B	A systematic investigation of the characteristics and development of Chinese nursing unit design is warranted to help U.S. healthcare designers to provide design that fits the local context.
M	The investigation is developed in two phases.
M	The first phase is a large-scale spatial analysis of 176 Chinese acute care unit layouts from three periods: 1989-1999 , 1999-2004 , and 2005-2015.
M	In addition to qualitative descriptions of the nursing unit typologies , the percentage of various typologies , patient room ( PR ) types , the number of beds , visibility from nurse station ( NS ) to PRs , and access to natural light during each period were evaluated quantitatively.
M	The second phase defined key factors that shape Chinese nursing unit design through expert interviews.
R	Significant differences were found between design in these three periods.
R	Chinese nursing unit size has continuously grown in the number of beds.
R	Most PRs have shifted from three-bed to double-bed rooms.
R	Most Chinese hospitals use single corridor , racetrack , and mutated racetrack layouts.
R	Mutated racetrack has taken over single corridor as the dominant configuration.
R	The access to southern sunlight remains important.
R	The average visibility from NS to some PRs is restricted by the preferences of allocating most PRs on the south side of a unit.
C	Chinese nursing unit design has undergone transformations to fit the local cultural , socioeconomic context and staffing model.
P	To describe the patterns of alcohol consumption in Brazilian adolescents.
M	We investigated adolescents who participated in the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents ( ERICA ).
M	This is a cross-sectional , national and school-based study , which surveyed adolescents of 1 ,247 schools from 124 Brazilian municipalities.
M	Participants answered a self-administered questionnaire with a section on alcoholic beverages consumption.
M	Measures of relative frequency ( prevalence ) , and their 95% confidence intervals , were estimated for the following variables: use of alcohol beverages in the last 30 days , frequency of use , number of glasses or doses consumed in the period , age of the first use of alcohol , and most consumed type of drink.
M	Data were estimated for country and macro-region , sex , and age group.
M	The module survey of the Stata program was used for data analysis of complex sample.
R	We evaluated 74 ,589 adolescents , who accounted for 72.9% of eligible students.
R	About 1/5 of adolescents consumed alcohol at least once in the last 30 days and about 2/3 in one or two occasions during this period.
R	Among the adolescents who consumed alcoholic beverages , 24.1% drank it for the first time before being 12 years old , and the most common type of alcoholic beverages consumed by them were drinks based on vodka , rum or tequila , and beer.
C	There is a high prevalence of alcohol consumption among adolescents , as well as their early onset of alcohol use.
C	We also identified a possible change in the preferred type of alcoholic beverages compared with previous research.
B	Major depressive disorder has been shown in some studies to attenuate weight loss and psychosocial outcomes following surgery.
B	Given the potential implications of depression on surgery outcomes , presurgery psychiatric assessment is recommended to assess suitability for bariatric surgery.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) in detecting depression in bariatric surgery candidates.
M	Bariatric surgery candidates ( n = 244 ) completed the PHQ-9 and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) as part of their presurgery psychiatric assessment.
M	The operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 were examined.
M	The study was replicated in an independent sample of bariatric surgery candidates ( n = 275 ).
R	Rates of current and lifetime major depressive episodes were 1.6% to 3.8% and 33.8% to 35.5% , respectively , as assessed by the MINI.
R	According to the PHQ-9 , 52.5% to 54.9% of patients exceeded the cutoff for moderate depression ( PHQ-9 >= 10 ) , and 27.6% to 29.1% for moderate severe depression ( PHQ-9 >= 15 ).
R	The optimal dichotomization cutoff point on the PHQ-9 was >= 15 in both studies ( sensitivity 75% , specificity 75% to 76% ).
C	Our results suggest that the PHQ-9 has adequate operating characteristics compared with a criterion standard measure.
C	A PHQ-9 cut-off of 15 is recommended to identify bariatric surgery candidates who may require further assessment of depressive symptoms.
B	In people who experience auditory verbal hallucinations , beliefs the person holds about their voices appear to be clinically important as mediators of associated distress and disability.
B	Whilst such beliefs are thought to be influenced by broader schematic representations the person holds about themselves and other people , there has been little empirical examination of this , in particular in relation to beliefs about voice intent and the personal meaning of the voice experience.
M	Thirty-four voice hearers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales and measures of beliefs about voices ( Revised Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire , Interpretation of Voices Inventory ) and schemas ( Brief Core Schema Scales ).
R	Beliefs about voices were correlated with both negative voice content and schemas.
R	After controlling for negative voice content , schemas were estimated to predict between 9% and 35% of variance in the six beliefs about voices that were measured.
R	Negative-self schemas were the strongest predictors , and positive-self and negative-other schemas also showed potential relationships with beliefs about voices.
C	Schemas , particularly those regarding the self , are potentially important in the formation of a range of clinically-relevant beliefs about voices.
B	Although clinical guidelines recommend the provision of care to reduce client chronic disease risk behaviours , such care is provided sub-optimally by primary healthcare providers.
B	A study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of an intervention in increasing community-based clinician implementation of multiple elements of recommended preventive care for four risk behaviours.
M	A three-group stepped-wedge trial was undertaken with all 56 community-based primary healthcare facilities in one health district in New South Wales , Australia.
M	A 12-month implementation intervention was delivered sequentially in each of three geographically and administratively defined groups of facilities.
M	The intervention consisted of six key strategies: leadership and consensus processes , enabling systems , educational meetings and training , audit and feedback , practice change support , and practice change information and resources.
M	Client-reported receipt of three elements of preventive care: assessment ; brief advice ; referral for four behavioural risks: smoking , inadequate fruit and/or vegetable consumption , alcohol overconsumption , and physical inactivity , individually , and for all such risks combined were collected for 56 months ( October 2009-May 2014 ).
M	Segmented logistic regression models were developed to assess intervention effectiveness.
R	A total of 5369 clients participated in data collection.
R	Significant increases were found for receipt of four of five assessment outcomes ( smoking OR 1.53 ; fruit and/or vegetable intake OR 2.18 ; alcohol consumption OR 1.69 ; all risks combined OR 1.78 ) and two of five brief advice outcomes ( fruit and/or vegetable intake OR 2.05 and alcohol consumption OR 2.64 ).
R	No significant increases in care delivery were observed for referral for any risk behaviour , or for physical inactivity.
C	The implementation intervention was effective in enhancing assessment of client risk status but less so for elements of care that could reduce client risk: provision of brief advice and referral.
C	The intervention was ineffective in increasing care addressing physical inactivity.
C	Further research is required to identify barriers to the provision of preventive care and the effectiveness of practice change interventions in increasing its provision.
P	This study aimed to examine the relationships between adolescents' eating disorder attitudes and their perceptions of the feeding practices that their parents/caregivers currently use.
M	Boys and girls ( N = 528 ) aged 13-15 completed self-report measures of their levels of eating psychopathology and their parents' current feeding practices and reported their own height and weight.
R	For girls , greater perceived pressure from parents to eat food and lower perceived parental responsibility for food were significantly related to more unhealthy eating-related attitudes.
R	Similar to girls , lower perceived parental responsibility for food was significantly related to greater levels of eating psychopathology in boys.
R	Greater perceived parental restriction of foods was also significantly related to greater eating psychopathology in boys.
C	These results suggest that adolescents' perceptions of their parents' use of more controlling feeding practices are related to greater prevalence of unhealthy eating-related attitudes.
C	Such findings have potentially important implications for the prevention of disordered eating in adolescents.

B	During a period of evolving international consensus on how to engage communities in research , facilitators and barriers to participation in HIV prevention research were explored in a rural plantation community in the coastal region of Cameroon.
M	A formative rapid assessment using structured observations , focus group discussions ( FGD ) , and key informant interviews ( KIIs ) was conducted with a purposive non-probabilistic sample of plantation workers and their household members.
M	Eligibility criteria included living or working >1 year within the plantation community and age >18 years.
M	Both rapid and in-depth techniques were used to complete thematic analysis.
R	Sixty-five persons participated in the study ( 6 FGDs and 12 KIIs ).
R	Participants viewed malaria and gastrointestinal conditions as more common health concerns than HIV.
R	They identified three factors as contributing to HIV risk: concurrent sexual relationships , sex work , and infrequent condom use.
R	Interviewees perceived that the community would participate in HIV research if it is designed to: ( 1 ) improve community welfare , ( 2 ) provide comprehensive health services and treatment for illnesses , ( 3 ) protect the personal information of participants , especially those who test positive for HIV , ( 4 ) provide participant incentives , ( 5 ) incorporate community input , and ( 6 ) minimize disruptions to "everyday life".
R	Barriers to participation included: ( 1 ) fear of HIV testing , ( 2 ) mistrust of researchers given possible disrespect or intolerance of plantation community life and lack of concern for communication , ( 3 ) time commitment demands , ( 3 ) medical care and treatment that would be difficult or costly to access , and ( 4 ) life disruptions along with potential requirements for changes in behaviour ( i.e. , engage in or abstain from alcohol use and sex activities ).
C	Consistent with UNAIDS guidelines for good participatory practice in HIV prevention research , study participants placed a high premium on researchers' politeness , trust , respect , communication , tolerance and empathy towards their community.
C	Plantation community members viewed provision of comprehensive health services as an important community benefit likely to enhance HIV research participation.
B	Teacher education candidates are in different places in terms of developing their identities and relationships to equity and social justice.
B	Various approaches have been taken within university-based teacher education programs to engage with candidates , wherever they are in this development.
B	One such approach has been engaging or drawing on teachers' own lenses , especially through challenging and understanding their racialized selves.
P	This conceptual article examines how race-based caucuses ( RBCs ) in one teacher education program attempted to shift candidates' understandings of their racialized selves as related to their teacher identities.
B	RBCs were instituted in one elementary teacher education program to help White teacher candidates and candidates of Color construct critical teacher identities.
B	Candidates were asked to participate in caucuses according to the ways they had been racialized within schools.
B	Facilitators who demonstrated a willingness to sit with the work of engaging race and racialization led the caucuses.
B	Observances: For the candidates of Color , the "overwhelming presence of Whiteness" in the teacher education program and in the schools required the RBCs to focus on reframing deficit narratives of teachers of Color to an asset-based view of their value and contribution to the teaching profession.
B	The RBC provided space for White teacher candidates to explore the consequences of Whiteness for their future identities as teachers and for the kinds of communities that they could and wanted to cultivate with students.
B	Messiness and challenges abounded in both RBCs.
B	Discussion and Reflections: Emotions-and especially emotion labor-were central to RBCs.
B	For teacher candidates of Color , facing one's own oppression was painful but also presented opportunities for them to articulate emotions and experiences in relatively safe spaces.
B	In a different way , the RBCs resulted in significant emotional upheaval for White teacher candidates that shifted into deeper self-reflection and sense of awareness and allyship ( for some )-although in a few cases , RBCs led to even deeper resistance.
C	Race-based caucusing is a messy and challenging practice that can provide opportunities to reflect constructively on emotions and produce emotional upheaval for teacher candidates.
C	Teacher educators and programs must approach RBCs with an orientation toward hyperreflexivity.
P	To analyse the psychometric properties and performance of the 17-item Benefit Finding Scale ( BFS ) in an Australian outpatient sample of men with prostate cancer.
M	The instrument's psychometric properties and performance were rated against established criteria for reliability ( internal consistency ) , construct validity ( instrument dimensionality ) and variability ( floor and ceiling effects ).
R	Internal consistency reliability was satisfactory as evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 Dimensionality analysis confirmed a unidimensional structure indicating construct validity.
R	A greater than 15% floor effect suggested limited data variability.
C	The 17-item BFS seems to have satisfactory psychometric properties for use in an outpatient sample of men with prostate cancer , with some questions regarding detection of variability.
C	The high internal consistency reliability points to the instruments ability to reliably capture the benefit finding construct in this population.
C	The evidence for instrument dimensionality indicates a unidimensional scale , and thus a calculation of a single total score can be recommended.
C	The >15% floor effect suggests that there may be issues with the instrument's ability to detect variance , and thus some questions remain regarding the instrument's ability to discern change in health status over time.
C	Nevertheless , the findings of this study together with previous evidence indicate that the 17-item BFS can be recommended as the tool of choice when exploring benefit finding in adult cancer populations.

B	A number of parenting programs , aimed at improving parenting competencies , have recently been adapted or designed with the use of online technologies.
B	Although web-based services have been claimed to hold promise for parent support , a meta-analytic review of online parenting interventions is lacking.
M	A systematic review was undertaken of studies ( n = 19 ) , published between 2000 and 2010 , that describe parenting programs of which the primary components were delivered online.
M	Seven programs were adaptations of traditional , mostly evidence-based , parenting interventions , using the unique opportunities of internet technology.
M	Twelve studies ( with in total 54 outcomes , N-tot parents = 1615 and N-tot children = 740 ) were included in a meta-analysis.
R	The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant medium effect across parents outcomes ( ES = 0.67 ; se = 0.25 ) and child outcomes ( ES = 0.42 ; se = 0.15 ).
C	The results of this review show that web-based parenting programs with new technologies offer opportunities for sharing social support , consulting professionals and training parental competencies.
C	The meta-analytic results show that guided and self-guided online interventions can make a significant positive contribution for parents and children.
C	The relation with other meta-analyses in the domains of parent education and web-based interventions is discussed.

B	This study aimed to assess factors affecting substandard care and probable medical errors associated with obstetric hemorrhage and HDP at a Northwestern Iranian health care system.
M	In a community-based descriptive cross-sectional study , data on all maternal deaths occurred at West Azerbaijan Province , Iran during a period of 10 years from March 21 , 2002 to March 20 , 2011 was analyzed.
M	The principal cause of death , main contributory factors , nature of care , main responsible staff for sub-standard care and medical error were determined.
M	The data on maternal deaths was obtained from the national Maternal Mortality Surveillance System ( MMSS ) which were covered all maternal deaths.
M	The "Three delays model" was used to recognize contributing factors of maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage and HDP.
R	There were 183 maternal deaths , therefore the Mean Maternal Mortality Ratio ( MMR ) in the province was 32.8 per 100 000 live births ( 95% CI , 32.64-32.88 ).
R	The most common causes of maternal deaths were obstetric hemorrhage in 36.6% of cases and HDP in 25.7%.
R	The factors that most contributed to the deaths were all types of medical errors and substandard care with different proportions in management of obstetric hemorrhage and HDP.
C	A substandard care and medical error was the major contributing factor in both obstetric hemorrhage and HDP leading to maternal mortality , therefore , it is necessary to improve the quality of health care at all levels especially hospitals.
B	There is evidence that the addition of current medical student interviewers ( CMSI ) to faculty interviewers ( FI ) is valuable to the medical school admissions process.
B	This study provides objective data about the contribution of CMSI to the admissions process.
M	Thirty-six applicants to a 4-year medical school program were interviewed by both CMSI and FI , and the evaluations completed by the two groups of interviewers were compared.
M	Both FI and CMSI assessed each applicant's motivation , medical experiences , personality , communication skills , and interests outside of the medical field , and provided a numerical score for each applicant on an evaluation form.
M	Both objective and subjective data were then extracted from the evaluation forms , and paired t-test and rank order tests were used for statistical analysis.
R	When compared with FI , CMSI wrote two to three times more words on the applicants' motivation , personality , communication skills , interests , and overall evaluation sections ( p<0.001 ) and provided about 60% more examples on the motivation section ( p = 0.0011 ) and communication skills section ( p = 0.0035 ).
R	In contrast , FI and CMSI provided similar numbers of negative examples in these and in the personality section and equivalent overall numerical evaluation scores.
C	These results indicate that when compared with FI , CMSI give equivalent overall evaluation scores to medical school candidates but provide additional potentially useful information particularly in the areas of motivation and communication skills to committees assigned the task of selecting students to be admitted to medical school.
B	Socioeconomic status may influence cross-national variations in elderly suicide rates.
M	The relationship between suicide rates in both sexes in the age-bands 65-74 years and 75+ years and ( i ) life expectancy , ( ii ) measures of socioeconomic status ( per capita gross national domestic product ( GDP ) and the Gini coeffcient ) , and ( iii ) measures of the quality and quantity of available healthcare services ( the proportion of GDP spent on health , per capita expenditure on health and child mortality rates ) was examined using data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations.
R	The main findings were: ( i ) a significant negative correlation between the Gini coefficient and suicide rates for both sexes in both age-bands ; ( ii ) a significant positive correlation between per capita expenditure on health and suicide rates for both sexes in both age-bands ; ( iii ) the significant positive correlation between the proportion of GDP spent on health and suicide rates was only evident in males in both age-bands ; ( iv ) a significant negative correlation between child mortality rates and suicide rates for both sexes in both age-bands ; and , ( v ) the significant positive correlation between life expectancy and suicide rates was evident in females in both age-bands.
C	A potentially testable model with five sequential stages was proposed to explain these findings.
B	Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia ( BPSD ) are important predictors of institutionalization as well as caregiver burden and depression.
B	Previous reviews have tended to group BPSD as one category with little focus on the role of the individual symptoms.
B	This review investigates the role of the individual symptoms of BPSD in relation to the impact on different measures of family caregiver well-being.
M	Systematic review and meta-analysis of papers published in English between 1980 and December 2015 reporting which BPSD affect caregiver well-being.
M	Paper quality was appraised using the Downs and Black Checklist ( 1998 ).
R	Forty medium and high quality quantitative papers met the inclusion criteria , 16 were suitable to be included in a meta-analysis of mean distress scores.
R	Depressive behaviors were the most distressing for caregivers followed by agitation/aggression and apathy.
R	Euphoria was the least distressing.
R	Correlation coefficients between mean total behavior scores and mean distress scores were pooled for four studies.
R	Irritability , aberrant motor behavior and delusions were the most strongly correlated to distress , disinhibition was the least correlated.
C	The evidence is not conclusive as to whether some BPSD impact caregiver well-being more than others.
C	Studies which validly examined BPSD individually were limited , and the included studies used numerous measures of BPSD and numerous measures of caregiver well-being.
C	Future research may benefit from a consistent measure of BPSD , examining BPSD individually , and by examining the causal mechanisms by which BPSD impact well-being by including caregiver variables so that interventions can be designed to target BPSD more effectively.
B	In March 2002 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ordered the introduction of a new staffing method - nursing hours per patient day ( NHPPD ) - for implementation in Western Australia public hospitals.
B	This method used a "bottom up" approach to classify each hospital ward into one of seven categories using characteristics such as patient complexity , intervention levels , the presence of high dependency beds , the emergency/elective patient mix and patient turnover.
B	Once classified , NHPPD were allocated for each ward.
P	The objective of this study was to determine the impact of implementing the NHPPD staffing method on 14 nursing-sensitive outcomes: central nervous system complications , wound infections , pulmonary failure , urinary tract infection , pressure ulcer , pneumonia , deep vein thrombosis , ulcer/gastritis/upper gastrointestinal bleed , sepsis , physiologic/metabolic derangement , shock/cardiac arrest , mortality , failure to rescue and length of stay.
M	The research design was an interrupted time series using retrospective analysis of patient and staffing administrative data from three adult tertiary hospitals in metropolitan Perth over a 4-year period.
M	All patient records ( N = 236 ,454 ) and nurse staffing records ( N = 150 ,925 ) from NHPPD wards were included.
R	The study found significant decreases in the rates of nine nursing-sensitive outcomes when examining hospital-level data following implementation of NHPPD ; mortality , central nervous system complications , pressure ulcers , deep vein thrombosis , sepsis , ulcer/gastritis/upper gastrointestinal bleed shock/cardiac arrest , pneumonia and average length of stay.
R	At the ward level , significant decreases in the rates of five nursing-sensitive outcomes ; mortality , shock/cardiac arrest , ulcer/gastritis/upper gastrointestinal bleed , length of stay and urinary tract infections occurred.
C	The findings provide evidence to support the continuation of the NHPPD staffing method.
C	They also add to evidence about the importance of nurse staffing to patient safety ; evidence that must influence policy.
C	This study is one of the first to empirically review a specific nurse staffing method , based on an individual assessment of each ward to determine staffing requirements , rather than a "one-size-fits-all" approach.

B	Rates of morbid obesity are higher for individuals with intellectual disability ( ID ).
B	Individuals with ID may find nutritional guidelines difficult to follow and many face personal and environmental barriers for physical activity.
B	Bariatric surgery may reduce obesity related health comorbidities while promoting sustained weight loss in diverse populations.
B	Yet no study has reviewed the feasibility of conducting bariatric surgery on individuals with ID.
P	To conduct a scoping review of literature on bariatric procedures performed on individuals with D.
M	Authors searched electronic database via PubMED , Science Direct , Wiley and Medline ( 1975-2014 ).
M	Extracted articles were evaluated independently following scoping reviews guidelines.
R	Reviewers included sixteen studies.
R	Nine surgical interventions were reported on 49 patients with ID.
R	Studies followed either case report or case series design.
R	The most common procedure patients received was biliopancreatic diversion ( n = 24 ) followed by Roux en -Y Gastric Bypass ( n = 12 ).
R	Degree of weight loss was the primary outcome in each study.
R	Excess weight loss ( %EWL ) ranged from 12% to 86%.
R	Further benefits included improved quality of life , decreased psychological tension within family and resolution of sleep apnea , hypertension , respiratory distress and type II diabetes.
R	Six studies included a post-operative follow-up period below two years.
C	Bariatric surgery may be a viable option to treat obesity in individuals with ID but there is no consensus which procedure is preferred and which associated interventions should be in place to warrant long lasting results.
C	Further research featuring randomized control trials may be beneficial.

B	Anxiety disorders are prevalent in youth and associated with later depressive disorders.
B	A recent model posits three distinct anxiety-depression pathways.
B	Pathway 1 represents youth with a diathesis to anxiety that increases risk for depressive disorders ; Pathway 2 describes youth with a shared anxiety-depression diathesis ; and Pathway 3 consists of youth with a diathesis for depression who develop anxiety as a consequence of depression impairment.
B	This is the first partial test of this model following cognitive-behavioral treatment ( CBT ) for child anxiety.
M	The present study included individuals ( N = 66 ; M age = 27.23 years , SD = 3.54 ) treated with CBT for childhood anxiety disorders 7-19 years ( M = 16.24 ; SD = 3.56 ) earlier.
M	Information regarding anxiety ( i.e. , social phobia ( SoP ) , separation anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) ) and mood disorders ( i.e. , major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and dysthymic disorders ) was obtained at pretreatment , posttreatment , and one or more follow-up intervals via interviews and self-reports.
R	Evidence of pathways from SoP , SAD , and GAD to later depressive disorders was not observed.
R	Treatment responders evidenced reduced GAD and SoP over time , although SoP was observed to have a more chronic and enduring pattern.
C	Evidence for typically observed pathways from childhood anxiety disorders was not observed.
C	Future research should prospectively examine if CBT treatment response disrupts commonly observed pathways.
B	Adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur throughout life and different brain pathologies were demonstrated to be associated with altered neurogenesis.
B	Here , an impact of heroin addiction on neurogenesis in humans is hypothesised.
M	Post mortem hippocampal specimens of drug addicts with known heroin abuse and a group of non-addictive control subjects were analysed , using antibodies indicating different stages of neurogenesis.
M	The subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus was examined qualitatively and quantitatively.
R	The data indicate ( i ) a decreased number of neural precursor cells , ( ii ) accompanied by low rates of proliferation and ( iii ) a marked loss of dendritic trees in targeting cells in heroin fatalities.
R	( iv ) The age-dependent increase of differentiating cells in the healthy controls was not observed in the addicts.
R	Additionally , double immunofluorescence labelling indicated the precursor nature of Musashi-1 positive cells in the human subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus.
C	Present data firstly demonstrate the influence of drug addiction with known heroin abuse on different developmental stages of progenitors in the dentate gyrus.
C	The patterns of antibody staining suggest a distinct inhibition of neurogenesis at the stage of neural precursor cells and revealed morphological changes in targeting cells in cases of heroin addicts as compared to healthy controls.
C	These alterations could be considerable for memory and cognitive deficits as well as addictive behaviour in chronic drug abusers and may give rise to specific pro-neurogenic therapies.

P	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are common and distressing side effects in patients with brain tumors and may be associated with radiation and the administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC ).
P	Pediatric antiemetic guidelines recommend administration of a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 ( 5HT( 3 ) ) receptor antagonists and the addition of aprepitant , a neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) antagonist with corticosteroids for the treatment of HEC.
P	However , challenges persist in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with brain tumors as corticosteroids are contraindicated due to potential impairment of the blood-brain barrier permeability.
P	The objective was to determine whether a 5HT( 3 ) receptor antagonist and the addition of aprepitant , an NK1 antagonist without a corticosteroid , were effective in reducing HEC vomiting in pediatric brain tumor patients.
M	A retrospective review found that 18 patients with a history of high-grade vomiting during radiation were prescribed a 5HT( 3 ) receptor antagonist and aprepitant without a corticosteroid during their first course of HEC.
M	To determine the efficacy of aprepitant without a corticosteroid , each recipient was matched with 2 controls who did not receiv aprepitant.
R	During HEC , controls without aprepitant were more likely to have Grade 2 or higher vomiting than the aprepitant recipients ( P = .03 ; odds ratio = 4.15 ; 95% confidence interval = 1.59-10.82 ) , after controlling for radiation-associated vomiting toxicity.
C	Significantly less vomiting was identified in children receiving HEC and prescribed a 5HT( 3 ) receptor antagonist and aprepitant.
C	Findings suggest that the addition of an NK1 antagonist may be beneficial to emetic control in this highly vulnerable population.
B	The N100 is a negative deflection in the surface EEG approximately 100ms after an auditory signal.
B	It has been shown to be reduced in individuals with schizophrenia and those at clinical high risk ( CHR ).
B	N100 blunting may index neural network dysfunction underlying psychotic symptoms.
B	This phenomenon has received little attention in pediatric populations.
M	This cross-sectional study compared the N100 response measured via the average EEG response at the left medial frontal position FC1 to 150 sinusoidal tones in participants ages 5 to 17 years with a CHR syndrome ( n=29 ) , a psychotic disorder ( n=22 ) , or healthy controls ( n=17 ).
R	Linear regression analyses that considered potential covariates ( age , gender , handedness , family mental health history , medication usage ) revealed decreasing N100 amplitude with increasing severity of psychotic symptomatology from healthy to CHR to psychotic level.
C	Longitudinal assessment of the N100 in CHR children who do and do not develop psychosis will inform whether it predicts transition to psychosis and if its response to treatment predicts symptom change.

P	This study examined the effects of night vision goggles ( NVGs ) on navigation and way-finding performance and the acquisition of spatial knowledge.
B	Although numerous studies have examined the effects of NVGs on visual perception , few have examined the effects of using NVGs on the acquisition and expression of spatial cognition.
M	Participants learned the environment through active navigation and way finding , searching for targets within a life-sized maze with or without NVGs.
M	Knowledge of the environment was then tested with two spatial memory tests.
R	Findings show that navigation and way finding with NVGs appear to be harder , as indicated by longer navigation times and additional , unnecessary turns , than they are without NVGs.
R	Moreover , change in navigation performance over the course of the way-finding trials varied as a function of group assignment indicating that NVGs influenced the learning process.
R	NVG users demonstrated a significant decrease in navigation times earlier as well as significant decreases in navigational legs compared with the control group.
R	In judging the positions of objects relative to target objects in different rooms in the maze , performance was better for participants without NVGs than for those with NVGs.
R	In a map-drawing task , participants in the NVG group were more likely to position objects incorrectly and to receive worse scores than the controls.
C	These results demonstrate that NVGs affected not only spatial navigation and way-finding performance but also the acquisition of spatial knowledge.
C	These degradations in spatial knowledge should be considered in operational planning and NVG training programs.
P	The aim of this study was to identify factors that are associated with adherence to hormonal therapy among breast cancer patients , and the extent to which they influence adherence , by looking at data from a nationally representative database.
M	A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( MEPS ) for 2011-2015.
M	Individuals >= 18 years diagnosed with breast cancer utilizing Tamoxifen and Aromatase inhibitors were identified.
M	The Proportion of Days Covered ( PDC ) adherence measure was used to classify individuals as adherent ( PDC >= 80% ) or non-adherent ( PDC < 80% ).
M	Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with adherence to hormonal therapy.
R	Out of the 354 breast cancer respondents utilizing hormonal therapy , 194 ( 54.8% ) were adherent and 160 ( 45.20% ) were non-adherent.
R	From 2011 through 2015 , an increase in the usage of hormonal therapy was observed.
R	Individuals having at least a high school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma ( GED ) had 2.795 ( 1.081 , 6.941 ) times the odds of being adherent when compared to those who did not have a high school diploma or GED.
R	Race , insurance status , marital status , poverty level , class of drug ( aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen ) , age , comorbidities , out-of-pocket costs and region were not significantly associated with adherence to hormonal therapy among breast cancer patients.
C	This study found an association between an individual's level of education and adherence to hormonal therapy among breast cancer patients.
C	These results can be used to help optimize allocation of resources to promote knowledge designed to increase the adherence of breast cancer patients to hormonal therapy.
B	Several studies have indicated an association between depression and the development of stroke , but few studies have focused on gender differences , although both depression and stroke are more common in women than in men.
B	The aim of the present study was to describe whether vital exhaustion , a measure of fatigue and depression , prospectively predicts ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in a large cohort , with particular focus on gender differences.
M	The cohort was composed of 5219 women and 3967 men without cardiovascular disease who were examined in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991-1994.
M	Subjects were followed for 6-9 years.
M	Fatal and nonfatal strokes were ascertained from the Danish National Register of Patients.
M	Cox proportional hazards model was used to describe vital exhaustion as a potential risk factor for stroke.
R	Four hundred nine validated strokes occurred.
R	A dose-response relationship between vital exhaustion score and the risk of stroke was found in women reaching a hazard ratio ( HR ) of 2.27 ( 95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.62 ) for the group with the highest score.
R	HR was only slightly attenuated by multivariate adjustment.
R	There was no association between vital exhaustion score and stroke in men.
R	FIR was strongest for ischemic stroke , whereas no association was seen for hemorrhagic stroke.
C	Vital exhaustion , a measure of fatigue , conveyed an increased risk of ischemic stroke in women , but not in men , in this study sample.

B	Despite the well-known effectiveness and widespread use of relapse prevention medications such as extended release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) and buprenorphine for opioid addiction in adults , less is known about their use in younger populations.
M	This was a naturalistic study using retrospective chart review of N = 56 serial admissions into a specialty community treatment program that featured the use of relapse prevention medications for young adults ( 19-26years old ) with opioid use disorders.
M	Treatment outcomes over 24weeks included retention and weekly opioid-negative urine tests.
R	Patients were of mean age 23.1 , 70% male , 86% Caucasian , 82% with history of injection heroin use , and treated with either buprenorphine ( 77% ) or XR-NTX ( 23% ).
R	The mean number of XR-NTX doses received was 4.1.
R	Retention was approximately 65% at 12weeks and 40% at 24weeks , and rates of opioid-negative urine were 50% at 12weeks and 39% at 24weeks , with missing samples imputed as positive.
R	There were no statistically significant differences in retention ( t = 1.87 , P = .06 ) or in rates of weekly opioid-negative urine tests ( t = 1.96 , P = .06 ) between medication groups , over the course of 24weeks.
R	The XR-NTX group had higher rates of weekly negative urine drug tests for other nonopioid substances ( t = 2.83 , P < .05 ) compared with the buprenorphine group.
R	Males were retained in treatment longer and had higher rates of opioid-negative weeks compared with females.
C	These results suggest that relapse prevention medications including both buprenorphine and XR-NTX can be effectively incorporated into standard community treatment for opioid addiction in young adults with good results.
C	Specialty programming focused on opioid addiction in young adults may provide a promising model for further treatment development.
B	Few current studies explore psychological well-being among older Chinese immigrants in Australia.
B	The study addressed this gap and provided preliminary data on psychological well-being among this group.
B	Four indicators , namely depression , anxiety , loneliness , and quality of life , were used to present a comprehensive picture of psychological well-being.
M	Participants were two groups of community-dwelling older people , specifically 59 Chinese immigrants and 60 Australian-born people ( median age=77 and 73 , respectively ).
M	Data were collected through standardized interviews.
M	The Geriatric Depression Scale , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire were used to measure depression , anxiety , loneliness , and quality of life , respectively.
R	Chinese participants' median quality of life score was higher than the scale mid-point , indicating relatively high levels of quality of life.
R	However , 10% exhibited symptoms of depression , 6% had symptoms of anxiety , and 49% felt lonely.
R	Compared to Australian participants , Chinese participants reported poorer quality of life and higher levels of loneliness.
R	Importantly , the difference in quality of life remained when the impact of socio-demographic factors was controlled for.
C	This study was the first to use multiple indicators to explore psychological well-being among older Chinese immigrants in Australia.
C	Its results suggest that their psychological well-being might be worse than that of Australian-born people when using loneliness and quality of life as indicators.
C	In particular , loneliness is a common psychological problem among this group , and there is a need for public awareness of this problem.
B	Informal care affects the quality of life and emotional health.
P	To analyze the relationship between burden and depression in caregivers measured by Zarit's Scale and GHQ-28 and the global functional deterioration of the elderly measured by OARS-MFAQ.
M	Descriptive observational cross-sectional study in Primary Health Care at Ourense city.
M	104 people ( >65 years old ) and their caregivers were interviewed.
M	Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were used to analyze the characteristics that increase the probability to suffer burden and depression.
R	82.7% of caregivers were women with an average age of 63.64 years ( 95% CI: 61.05-66.23 ) and 10.3% were over 80 years old.
R	32.2% had an overload , associated with taking care of younger people ( p=0.043 ) , being a couple of an elder ( p=0.003 ) being older ( p=0.031 ) and the risk of depression which were all found as factors associated with burden , measured by GHQ ( p<0.001 ).
R	Having good perception of the vision ( p=0.038 ) , rejecting the use of a cane ( p=0.002 ) or wheelchair ( p=0.015 ) were also associated with factors contributing to burden.
C	Informal caregivers are women around their sixties , and although they do not feel overburdened for caring , they have depression.
C	more likely the more severe the burden is , and it is related with the perception of economic deficiencies for the caring.
B	The utilization of preventive care services in the United States remains low , despite health-care costs being as high as $2.3 trillion.
B	While gender disparities have been known to exist for utilization of overall health-care services , the same issue has not been probed for preventive care utilization.
M	A retrospective , cross-sectional study using the 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( MEPS ).
M	Preventive care services common to both genders were included ( blood pressure checkup , cholesterol checkup , sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy , flu shot , and dental checkup ).
M	Guideline adherence was determined using clinically accepted guidelines such as Joint National Committee 7 and the American Cancer Society.
M	Descriptive statistics were used to describe the population , and chi-square analysis was used to determine the within group differences between the two genders.
M	A multivariate logistic regression was built to determine the likelihood of guideline adherence based on gender while adjusting for known demographic confounders such as age , race , and ethnicity.
R	There were 33 ,066 MEPS respondents for 2008.
R	Of these , 4 ,291 to 30 ,629 met the inclusion criteria depending on the specific preventive care service being analyzed.
R	Men were found to have significantly lower odds of using blood pressure check ( odds ratio [OR] 0.35 , 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.38 ) , cholesterol check ( OR 0.64 , CI 0.60-0.69 ) , dental check ( OR 0.71 , CI 0.68-0.75 ) , and flu shots ( OR 0.71 , CI 0.67-0.76 ).
R	While men had lower utilization for sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy , the difference was nonsignificant.
C	Preventive care utilization was found to be higher in women than in men.
C	The gender disparity issue needs to be explored in greater detail to understand these differences.
B	Collaborative working between professionals is a key component of integrated care.
B	The academic literature on it largely focuses either on integration between health and social care or on the dynamics of power and identity between doctors and nurses.
B	With the proliferation and extension of nursing roles , there is a need to examine collaborative working amongst different types of nurses.
M	This study explored experiences of collaborative working amongst generalist and specialist nurses , in community and acute settings.
M	We carried out semi-structured interviews , incorporating the Pictor technique , with 45 nurses , plus 33 other key stakeholders.
M	Transcripts were analysed using Template Analysis.
M	This article focuses on one major thematic area that emerged from the analysis: the significance of interpersonal relationships amongst nurses , and between them and other professionals , patients and carers.
R	Relationship issues were ubiquitous in participants' accounts of collaborative working.
R	Good personal relationships facilitated collaboration ; face-to-face interaction was especially valued.
R	Relationships were recognized as requiring effort , especially in new roles.
R	Organisational changes could disrupt productive personal networks.
C	Relationship issues are integral to successful collaborative working.
C	Policy and practice leaders must take this into account in future service developments.
C	Further research into collaborative relationships in different settings is needed.
B	There is ample evidence that residential neighbourhoods can influence mental well-being ( MWB ) , with most studies relying on census or similar data to characterize communities.
B	Few studies have actively investigated local residents' perceptions.
M	Concept mapping was conducted with residents from five Toronto neighbourhoods representing low income and non-low income socio-economic groups.
M	These residents participated in small groups and attended two sessions per neighbourhood.
M	The first session ( brainstorming ) generated neighbourhood characteristics that residents felt influenced their MWB.
M	A few weeks later , participants returned to sort these neighbourhood characteristics and rate their relative importance in affecting residents' 'good' and 'poor' MWB.
M	The data from the sorting and rating groups were analyzed to generate conceptual maps of neighbourhood characteristics that influence MWB.
R	While agreement existed on factors influencing poor MWB ( regardless of neighbourhood , income , gender and age ) , perceptions related to factors affecting good MWB were more varied.
R	For example , women were more likely to rank physical beauty of their neighbourhood and range of services available as more important to good MWB , while men were more likely to cite free access to computers/internet and neighbourhood reputation as important.
R	Low-income residents emphasized aesthetic attributes and public transportation as important to good MWB , while non-low-income residents rated crime , negative neighbourhood environment and social concerns as more important contributors to good MWB.
C	These findings contribute to the emerging literature on neighbourhoods and MWB , and inform urban planning in a Canadian context.
P	Prior research has documented associations between mental health and alcohol use , mental health and insomnia , and insomnia and alcohol use.
P	This study examined insomnia severity as a mediator of the association between mental health and alcohol-related outcomes in young adult veterans.
P	Veterans aged 18-34 years ( N = 622 , 83% male ) who reported drinking in the past year completed assessments at baseline and one-month follow-up as part of a larger intervention trial.
P	Participants reported symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) at baseline , insomnia severity at one month , and alcohol use and related consequences at baseline and one month.
P	Mediation analyses using bootstrapped confidence intervals were used to examine the indirect effects of baseline mental health symptoms on alcohol related outcomes at one month via insomnia severity.
C	Insomnia severity was associated with both drinking quantity and alcohol-related consequences.
C	Greater depressive ( but not PTSD ) symptoms were associated directly with more alcohol-related consequences.
C	Neither depressive nor PTSD symptoms had direct effects on drinking quantity when controlling for the other mental health symptoms ( e.g. , depressive symptoms did not predict drinking quantity when controlling for symptoms of PTSD ).
C	However , symptoms of depression and PTSD predicted drinks per week and alcohol-related consequences indirectly through insomnia severity.
C	Symptoms of depression and PTSD increase risk for alcohol use and related consequences in part by increasing symptoms of insomnia.
C	Findings suggest that insomnia may be an appropriate target for prevention and intervention efforts among heavy-drinking Veterans reporting symptoms of depression or PTSD.
P	This study examined reliability and validity of the researcher-developed 17-item Evidence-Based Practice Self-efficacy ( EBPSE ) scale.
M	A quasi-experimental , pretest/posttest design with comparison group was applied.
M	Setting included inpatient , ambulatory , long-term care , and hospice units from a large US academic medical center and affiliated sites ( n = 14 ).
M	Two cohorts of staff ( 26% ) and leadership nurses ( 74% ) participated in a 1-year educational program on clinical informatics and evidence-based practice ( EBP ) ( cohort 1 , n = 53 , 2007-2008 ; cohort 2 , n = 40 , 2008-2009 ).
M	The EBPSE scale involves a 1% to 100% response scale , with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy.
M	Both cohorts completed the EBPSE scale at baseline ( time 1 ) and after the clinical informatics content ( time 2 ) ; cohort 1 also completed the scale at program completion after delivery of EBP content ( time 3 ).
M	Analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics.
R	Missing data ranged from 10% to 17% for participants at time 2 and 43% for cohort 1 at time 3.
R	Cronbach a coefficients ranged from .95 to .98 across time and cohorts.
R	Baseline and time 2 average EBPSE scale scores did not differ between cohorts.
R	Average scores increased significantly [P < .01 ) from time I to time 2 ( all participants ) and time 2 to time 3 ( cohort 1 ).
C	Findings suggest promise for the EBPSE scale as a measure of EBPSE and target for practice improvements.
C	Further study is needed with a larger small sample and less attrition.
C	The EBPSE scale may foster leading EBP and mentoring nursing staff.
P	Eating disorders ( ED ) are complex and severe illnesses where evidence-based treatment is needed to recover.
P	However , about half of the patients with ED do not respond to treatments currently available , which call for efforts to expand the portfolio of treatments.
P	The aim of this study was to explore experiences from patients who dropped out of a new treatment for bulimia nervosa and binge ED , combining physical exercise and dietary therapy ( PED-t ).
M	We conducted open-ended face-to-face interviews.
M	The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the data were analysed with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach.
R	Three themes emerged: "standing on the outside" , "unmet expectations" and "participation not a waste of time".
R	Feelings of standing on the outside were elicited by being different from other group members and having challenges with sharing thoughts.
R	Unmet expectations were related to treatment content and intensity , as well as the development of unhealthy thoughts and behaviours.
R	Finally , some positive experiences were voiced.
C	A need to clarify pre-treatment expectations and refining criteria for treatment suitability is indicated.
C	The findings have contributed to the chain of clinical evidence regarding the PED-t and may lead to treatment modifications improving the treatment and thereby reducing drop out.
P	Extensive prior research has documented the relationship between self-control and deviance , albeit almost exclusively at the individual level.
P	In fact , only two recent examinations of self-control and adverse outcomes ( including deviance ) exist at the macro-level.
M	In order to extend prior research , this study relies on data from all counties in the state of Texas with a population of over 10 ,000 residents to provide a county-level analysis of the ability of macro-level self-control to predict three outcomes: violent crime , property crime , and unemployment rates.
R	Exploratory factor analyses supported the existence of two macro-level dimensions of self-control , e.g. , initiatory and inhibitory self-control.
R	Subsequent correlational and predictive regression analyses provided evidence of the linkages between these macro-level indicators of self-control and a number of adverse outcomes.
C	The findings highlight the importance of continued inquiry into macro-level indicators of self-control and the role of macro-level manifestations of self-control in policy and prevention initiatives to promote crime prevention and prevent adult adjustment problems such as unemployment.
B	The wellness construct has application in a number of fields including education , healthcare and counseling , particularly with regard to female adolescents.
B	The effective measurement of wellness in adolescents can assist researchers and practitioners in determining lifestyle behaviors in which they are lacking.
B	Behavior change interventions can then be designed which directly aid in the promotion of these areas.
M	The 5-Factor Wellness Inventory ( designed to measure the Indivisible Self model of wellness ) is a popular instrument for measuring the broad aspects of wellness amongst adolescents.
M	The instrument comprises 97 items contributing to 17 subscales , five dimension scores , four context scores , total wellness score , and a life satisfaction index.
M	This investigation evaluated the test-retest ( intra-rater ) reliability of the 5F-Wel instrument in repeated assessments ( seven days apart ) among adolescent females aged 12-14 years.
M	Percentages of exact agreement for individual items , and the number of respondents who scored within +/- 5 , +/- 7.5 and +/- 10 points for total wellness and the five summary dimension scores were calculated.
R	Overall , 46 ( 95.8% ) participants responded with complete data and were included in the analysis.
R	Item agreement ranged from 47.8% to 100% across the 97 items ( median 69.9% , interquartile range 60.9%-73.9% ).
R	The percentage of respondents who scored within +/- 5 , +/- 7.5 and +/- 10 points for total wellness at the re-assessment was 87.0% , 97.8% and 97.8% respectively.
R	The percentage of respondents who scored within +/- 5 , +/- 7.5 and +/- 10 for the domain scores at the reassessment ranged between 54.3-76.1% , 78.3-95.7% and 89.1-95.7% respectively across the five dimensions.
C	These findings suggest there was considerable variation in agreement between the two assessments on some individual items.
C	However , the total wellness score and the five dimension summary scores remained comparatively stable between assessments.
B	The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is marked by many changes.
B	Mental well-being plays an important role in how individuals deal with these changes and how they develop their lifestyle.
B	The goal of this study was to examine gender differences in the long-term development of self-esteem and other mental well-being variables from the age of 15 to the age of 23.
M	A baseline measurement was performed in a nationwide sample of 385 Icelandic adolescents aged 15 , and a follow-up measurement was conducted eight years later , when participants had reached the age of 23.
M	Standardized questionnaires were used to measure self-reports of self-esteem , life satisfaction , body image , anxiety , depression and somatic complaints.
R	Women improved their self-esteem significantly more than men from the age of 15 to 23 ( p=0.004 ).
R	Women were more satisfied with their life than men at the age of 23 ( p=0.009 ).
R	Men had a better body image , less anxiety , less depression and fewer somatic complaints than women , independent of age.
R	Across gender , anxiety declined and somatic complaints became fewer ( p<0.05 ).
C	These findings suggest that gender differences in mental well-being factors , favouring men , found in adolescents , are not as long-lasting as previously thought.
C	Women improve their mental well-being from adolescence to young adulthood while men's mental well-being does not change.
B	Caring for the bereaved is an intrinsic part of intensive care practice with family bereavement support an important aspect of the nursing role at end of life.
B	However , reporting on provision of intensive care family bereavement support at a national level has not been well reported since an Australian paper published ten years ago.
P	The objective was to investigate provision of family bereavement support in intensive care units ( ICU ) across New Zealand ( NZ ) and Australia.
M	A cross-sectional exploratory descriptive web-based survey was used.
M	All ICUs [public/private , neonatal/pediatrics/adults] were included.
M	The survey was distributed to one nursing leader from each identified ICU ( n = 229 ; 188 in Australia , 41 in NZ ).
M	Internal validity of the survey was established through piloting.
M	Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data.
M	Ethical approval was received by the ethics committees of two universities.
R	One-hundred and fifty-three ( 67% ) responses were received from across New Zealand and Australia with 69.3% of respondents from the public sector.
R	Whilst respondents reported common bereavement practices to include debriefing for staff after a traumatic death ( 87.9% ) , there was greater variation in sending a sympathy card to families ( NZ 54.2% , Australia 20.8% ).
R	Fifty percent of responding New Zealand units had a bereavement follow-up service compared to 28.3% of Australian unit respondents.
R	Of those with follow-up services , 92.3% of New Zealand units undertook follow-up calls to families compared to 76.5% of Australian units.
R	Bereavement follow-up services were mainly managed by social workers in Australia and nursing staff in New Zealand.
C	This is the first Australia and New Zealand-wide survey on ICU bereavement support services.
C	Whilst key components of family bereavement support remain consistent over the past decade , there were fewer bereavement follow-up services in responding Australian ICUs in 2015.
C	As a quality improvement initiative , support for this area of family care remains important with rigorous evaluation essential.

B	Health plans are moving away from a volume-driven payment structure toward value-driven and risk-based contracts.
B	There is very limited information on commercial payers' perspectives on coverage of medication management services ( MMS ) in value-based alternative payment models.
B	While some health plans have experience with Medicare Part D Medication Therapy Management ( MTM ) programs , this experience does not promote the integration of pharmacists as health care team members.
P	The study objectives were to: ( 1 ) understand the evaluation process that health plan executives would use to determine benefit coverage for pharmacist-provided MMS in value-based health plans , ( 2 ) identify the facilitators and barriers that affect pharmacist-provided MTM services at the community pharmacy level , and ( 3 ) propose strategies for pharmacist-provided MMS in value-based health plans.
M	This study used qualitative research methods that involved structured key informant interviews with commercial health plan executives and focus groups with community pharmacists who had experience providing MTM services.
R	Health plan executives agreed conceptually that MMS could be a valuable program and recognized its potential.
R	However , the most substantial barriers that health plan executives expressed were funding MMS in today's fee-for-service payment models ; lack of physician infrastructure to implement and manage MMS ; and difficulty in collecting timely , accurate data to execute and assess MMS programs.
R	Community pharmacists identified the most serious barrier to altering health outcomes through MTM as the current lack of integration of MTM with a coordinated health care team.
R	MTM services are conducted as a separate program by pharmacists who do not have access to patient health records , are time-constrained , and poorly incentivized.
C	The findings can inform the development of successful strategies for pharmacist-provided MMS that align with emerging value-based health plans and alternative provider payment models.
C	Current MTM program barriers and facilitators are identified that could be addressed in future Part D MTM program policy changes.

P	Past research studies have focused on perceptions of stuttering by various age groups and only a few have examined how children react to a peer who stutters.
P	All of these studies used a quantitative analysis but only one included a qualitative analysis of elementary school age children's responses to stuttering.
P	The aim of this study was to further explore the perceptions of elementary school students toward a peer who stutters using both quantitative and qualitative analyses of three levels of stuttering.
M	Participants included 88 elementary school children between 8 and 12 years of age.
M	Each participant viewed one of four audiovisual samples of a peer producing fluent speech and mild , moderate , and severe simulated stuttering.
M	Each participant then rated five Likert statements and answered three open-ended questions.
R	Quantitative and qualitative results indicated that negative ratings and the percentage of negative comments increased as the frequency of stuttering increased.
R	However , the children in this study indicated that they were comfortable listening to stuttering and would be comfortable making friends with the peer who stutters.
C	The findings of this study together with past research in this area should help clinicians and their clients appreciate the range of social and emotional reactions peers have of a child who stutters.
C	Educational objectives: After reading this article , the reader will be able to: ( a ) discuss past research regarding children's perceptions of stuttering ; ( b ) summarize the need to explore the perceptions of elementary-aged children toward a peer who stutters ; ( c ) describe the major quantitative and qualitative findings of children's perceptions of stuttering ; and ( d ) discuss the need for disseminating more information about stuttering to children and teachers.

B	Faith-based organizations ( FBOs ) have a long history of providing health services in developing countries and are important contributors to healthcare systems.
B	Support for the wellbeing of women , children , and families is evidenced through active participation in the field of family planning ( FP ).
B	However , there is little quantitative evidence on the availability or quality of FP services by FBOs.
M	The descriptive analysis uses facility-level data collected through recent Service Provision Assessments in Malawi ( 2013-14 ) , Kenya ( 2010 ) , and Haiti ( 2012 ) to examine 11 indicators of FP service and method availability and nine indicators of comprehensive and quality counseling.
M	The indicators include measures of FP service provision , method mix , method stock , the provision of accurate information , and the discussion of reproductive intentions , client's questions/concerns , prevention of sexually transmitted infections , and return visits , among others.
M	Pearson's Chi-square test is used to assess the selected indicators by managing authority ( FBO , public , and other private sector ) to determine statistical equivalence.
R	Results show that FBOs are less likely to offer FP services than other managing authorities ( p < 0.05 ).
R	For example , 69% of FBOs in Kenya offer FP services compared to 97% of public facilities and 83% of other private facilities.
R	Offering long-acting or permanent methods in faith-based facilities is especially low ( 43% in Malawi , 29% in Kenya and 39% in Haiti ).
R	There were few statistically significant differences between the managing authorities in comprehensive and quality counseling indicators.
R	Interestingly , Haitian FBOs often perform as well or better than public sector health facilities on counseling indicators , such as discussion of a return visit ( 79% of FBO providers vs. 68% of public sector providers ) and discussion of client concerns/questions ( 52% vs. 49% , respectively ).
C	Results from this analysis indicate that there is room for improvement in the availability of FP services by FBOs in these countries.
C	Quality of counseling should be improved by all managing authorities in the three countries , as indicated by low overall coverage for practices such as ensuring confidentiality ( 22% in Malawi , 47% in Kenya and 12% in Haiti ) , discussion of sexually transmitted infections ( 18% , 25% , 17% , respectively ) , and providing services to youth ( 53% , 27% , 32% , respectively ).
B	The anxiety disorders specified in the fourth edition , text revision , of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM-IV-TR ) are identified universally in human societies , and also show substantial cultural particularities in prevalence and symptomatology.
B	Possible explanations for the observed epidemiological variability include lack of measurement equivalence , true differences in prevalence , and limited validity or precision of diagnostic criteria.
B	One central question is whether , through inadvertent "over-specification" of disorders , the post-DSM-III nosology has missed related but somewhat different presentations of the same disorder because the do not exactly fit specified criteria sets.
B	This review canvases the mental health literature for evidence of cross-cultural limitations in DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder criteria.
M	Searches were conducted of the mental health literature , particularly since 1994 , regarding cultural or race/ethnicity-related factors that might limit the universal applicability of the diagnostic criteria for six anxiety disorders.
R	Possible mismatches between the DSM criteria and the local phenomenology of the disorder in specific cultural contexts were found for three anxiety disorders in particular.
R	These involve the unexpectedness and 10-minute crescendo criteria in Panic Disorder ; the definition of social anxiety and social reference group in Social Anxiety Disorder ; and the priority given to psychological symptoms of worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder , Limited evidence was found throughout , particularly in terms of neurobiological markers , genetic risk factors , treatment response , and other DSM-V validators that could help clarify the cross-cultural applicability of criteria.
C	On the basis of the available data , options and preliminary recommendations for DSM-V are put forth that should be further evaluated and tested.

B	Content analysis is a research technique used to systematically collect and analyze the makeup and exchange of communication through various visual , auditory , and print media.
B	It has been used in health care to study communications to audiences using a broad range of media.
P	The purpose of this article is to introduce the methodology of content analysis and suggest some recommendations for its use.
M	A review of steps used in content analysis are provided and illustrated using 2 examples of pharmacy advertising research to highlight major ideas , delineate problems faced when using the methodology , and describe how issues were resolved.
R	The quality of content analysis studies depends on using clear definitions of study constructs , explicit sampling methods , systematic analysis and reporting of data , and inferences that incorporate current research evidence.
R	Transparent methods that permit reproducibility of results are essential.
C	Ultimately , good content analysis depends on the skill , competence , diligence , and integrity of trained researchers.

B	Inconsistent , poorly designed research on resilience in the human sciences has contributed to epistemological and ontological ambiguity which has fuelled claims that resilience as a concept is poorly theorized.
P	Building on research with abused and neglected children around the world , the objective of this paper is to show that studies of resilience must account for: ( a ) risk exposure ( of relevance in different contexts ) ; ( b ) promotive and protective processes ( internal and external resources associated with resilience across systems ) ; and ( c ) desired outcomes ( as privileged by stakeholders in different cultures and contexts ).
M	By identifying common aspects of resilience research from a purposeful selection of studies ( ones with weak and strong methodologies ) , this paper identifies three dimensions of well-designed studies of childhood resilience.
R	Attention to all three dimensions enhances both the empirical validity ( in the quantitative research paradigm ) and phenomenological trustworthiness ( in qualitative research ) of resilience research with children and families.
R	Challenges researching resilience can also be resolved by designing studies that account for all three dimensions.
R	These challenges include the lack of systemic thinking to account for contextual factors and other external threats to child wellbeing , and the excessive generalization of findings.
R	Conclusion.
R	- This three-part model for resilience research reflects the very best practices among resilience researchers and has the potential to address the definitional and methodological ambiguity that plague studies of resilience.
B	Despite the availability of many effective treatments , patients with major depression remain at risk for relapse following remission of a depressive episode.
B	The aims of this report are to estimate the relapse rates associated with the acute treatment strategies employed in this study and to investigate demographic and clinical predictors of relapse.
M	The study sample includes 225 patients who entered the 6-month continuation treatment phase after remitting from an acute depressive episode.
M	Treatment during the acute phase was interpersonal psychotherapy , SSRI ( escitalopram ) , or the combination of the two when monotherapy did not lead to response.
M	Relapse was defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score >= 15 , confirmed by the diagnosis of major depression.
M	The probability of relapsing was modeled using logistic regression.
M	Three separate models were fit with subgroups of covariates.
R	Of the 225 patients , 29 ( 12.9% ) relapsed and 28 ( 12.4% ) discontinued the protocol prematurely.
R	The proportion of patients who relapsed among the group requiring combination treatment to achieve remission was three times as high as among patients who had remitted with monotherapy.
R	In the final logistic regression model , older age , higher baseline HDRS scores , last month ( residual ) depressive mood spectrum factor score , and requiring combination treatment to achieve remission were each associated with an increased likelihood of relapse.
C	Our results suggest that greater initial depression severity , greater difficulty in stabilizing symptoms , and presence of residual mood spectrum symptoms once remission is achieved are predictive of relapse.
C	Risk of relapse is more likely as age increases , partly because aging confers lower resilience.

B	Although there is considerable public concern about the environmental impacts of oil pollution in the Niger Delta of Nigeria , actual evidence on the pathological and psychological effects in the health of local communities is minimally known.
B	We sought to associate the perspective measures of exposure to oil pollution with health outcomes ( inventory of health symptoms and functional capacity limitations ) and determine how emotional reactions to environmental risks moderate these health outcomes.
M	The study was conducted with 600 participants selected from five local government areas in Akwa Ibom State where oil pollution is rampant.
M	A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data on the respondents' exposure to oil pollution , self-rated health and disease symptoms , perception of risk of exposure and emotional reactions to local oil pollution.
R	Most of the participants lived in areas with visible oil pollution and/or near gas flaring facilities and regularly suffered direct exposure to oil in their environment.
R	High level of emotional distress was a part of everyone's life for the study population.
R	Risk perception in the study area was mediated , to a large extent , by dreaded hazards ( catastrophic fears of pipeline explosions and oil spill fire ) , visual cues ( gas flares and smoke stacks ) and chemosensory cues ( off-flavor in drinking water ).
R	The exposure metrics were found to be significant predictors of the health effects and influencing factors ( emotional reactions ).
R	Multi-levels models suggest that at the individual level , the demographic variables and direct contact with oil pollution were important mediators of functional capacity limitation.
R	At the community level , emotional distress from fear of the sources of exposure was an important mediator of the health symptoms.
C	This study documents high levels of disease symptoms and environmental distress ( worry , annoyance and intolerance ) associated with oil pollution in the Niger Delta areas of Nigeria.
C	It highlights the need for some intervention to ameliorate the psychological distress associated with living under such environmental adversity.
B	Teaching interns patient-centered communication skills , including making structured telephone calls to patients following discharge , may improve transitions of care.
P	To explore associations between a patient-centered care ( PCC ) curriculum and patients' perspectives of the quality of transitional care.
M	We implemented a novel PCC curriculum on one of four inpatient general medicine resident teaching teams in which interns make post-discharge telephone calls to patients , contact outpatient providers , perform medication adherence reviews , and engage in patient-centered discharge planning.
M	Between July and November of 2011 , we conducted telephone surveys of patients from all four teaching teams within 30 days of discharge.
M	In addition to asking if patients received a call from their hospital physician ( intern ) , we administered the 3-Item Care Transitions Measure ( CTM-3 ) , which assesses patients' perceptions of preparedness for the transition from hospital to home ( possible score range 0-100 ).
R	The CTM-3 scores ( mean +/- SD ) of PCC team patients and standard team patients were not significantly different ( 82.4 +/- 17.3 vs. 79.6 +/- 17.6 , p = 0.53 ).
R	However , regardless of team assignment , patients who reported receiving a post-discharge telephone call had significantly higher CTM-3 scores than those who did not ( 84.7 +/- 16.0 vs. 78.2 +/- 17.4 , p = 0.03 ).
R	Interns exposed to the PCC curriculum called their patients after discharge more often than interns never exposed ( OR = 2.78 , 95% CI [1.25 , 6.18] , p = 0.013 ).
C	The post-discharge telephone call , one element of PCC , was associated with higher CTM-3 scores - which , in turn , have been shown to lessen patients' risk of emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge.
B	This study was conducted to establish the minimal detectable change ( MDC ) and clinically important differences ( CIDs ) of the physical category of the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale in patients with stroke.
M	MDC and CIDs scores were calculated from the data of 74 participants enrolled in randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of two rehabilitation programs in patients with stroke.
M	These participants received treatments for 3 weeks and underwent clinical assessment before and after treatment.
M	To obtain test-retest reliability for calculating MDC , another 25 patients with chronic stroke were recruited.
M	The MDC was calculated from the standard error of measurement ( SEM ) to indicate a real change with 95% confidence for individual patients ( MDC( 95 ) ).
M	Distribution-based and anchor-based methods were adopted to triangulate the ranges of minimal CIDs.
M	The percentage of scale width was calculated by dividing the MDC and CIDs by the total score range of each physical category.
M	The percentage of patients exceeding MDC( 95 ) and minimal CIDs was also reported.
R	The MDC95 of the mobility , self-care , and upper extremity ( UE ) function subscales were 5.9 , 4.0 , and 5.3 respectively.
R	The minimal CID ranges for these 3 subscales were 1.5 to 2.4 , 1.2 to 1.9 , and 1.2 to 1.8.
R	The percentage of patients exceeding MDC95 and minimal CIDs of the mobility , self-care , and UE function subscales were 9.5% to 28.4% , 6.8% to 28.4% , and 12.2% to 33.8% , respectively.
C	The change score of an individual patient has to reach 5.9 , 4.0 , and 5.3 on the 3 subscales to indicate a true change.
C	The mean change scores of a group of patients with stroke on these subscales should reach the lower bound of CID ranges of 1.5 ( 6.3% scale width ) , 1.2 ( 6.0% scale width ) , and 1.2 ( 6.0% scale width ) to be regarded as clinically important change.
C	This information may facilitate interpretations of patient-reported outcomes after stroke rehabilitation.
C	Future research is warranted to validate these findings.
P	To compare peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) complication rates in upper versus lower extremity insertion sites in neonates.
P	SUBJECTS: Neonates who had PICCs inserted while hospitalized in an urban , 84-bed , level III neonatal intensive care unit in the southwestern United States between 2004 and 2009 were included in the study.
P	A total of 559 neonates with 626 PICCs were reviewed.
P	Neonates who were transferred out of the hospital with an indwelling PICC or had incomplete PICC data were excluded ( n = 29 ).
M	Comparative descriptive.
M	Retrospective review of PICC records.
M	Demographic data , neonate survival to PICC removal , PICCs inserted by non-PICC team members , and complications were compiled.
M	Complications included presumed sepsis , occlusion , leaking , infiltration/edema , inadvertent removal , phlebitis , pleural effusion , tip malposition , and catheter breakage.
M	The complications were analyzed between extremities using chi-square or independent-samples t test where appropriate.
R	Type and rate of complication requiring PICC removal and the extremity used for insertion.
R	PRINCIPAL
R	A total of 374 PICCs ( 59.7% ) were inserted in upper extremities and 252 ( 40.3% ) in lower extremities.
R	The upper and lower extremity groups were comparable in all variables except neonate survival to PICC removal , which was greater in neonates with lower extremity PICCs ( 95.2% in upper extremities vs 98.8% in lower extremities ; P = .01 ).
R	No significant difference ( P = .08 ) was found in the overall complication rate ( 27% in upper extremity PICCs vs 21% in lower extremity PICCs ).
R	Presumed sepsis was the most common complication requiring PICC removal in both extremity groups.
R	At the time of removal , upper extremity PICCs were more likely to have a noncentral tip than lower extremity PICCs ( 15% vs 4% , respectively ).
R	In PICCs removed because of complications , noncentral tips were found to be statistically significant in upper extremity PICCs ( P < .0001 ).
C	No significant difference was found in complications that necessitated PICC removal between upper versus lower extremity PICC insertion sites.
C	Catheter tip location may have a significant impact on complications and deserves further investigation.
C	The choice of a PICC insertion site in neonates should be based on the quality of appropriate , available veins and the preference and skill of the inserter.
C	Every effort should be made to achieve and maintain a centrally located PICC tip.
B	Interventions to increase children's physical activity ( PA ) have achieved limited success.
B	This may be attributed to inaccurate parental perceptions of their children's PA and a lack of recognition of a need to change activity levels.
M	Fifty-three parents participated in semistructured interviews to determine perceptions of child PA.
M	Perceptions were compared with children's measured MVPA ( classified as meeting or not meeting UK guidelines ) to produce 3 categories: "accurate ," "over-estimate ," and "under-estimate."
M	Deductive content analysis was performed to understand the accuracy of parental perceptions.
R	All parents of children meeting the PA guidelines accurately perceived their child's PA ; while the majority of parents whose child did not meet the guidelines overestimated their PA.
R	Most parents were unconcerned about their child's PA level , viewing them as naturally active and willing to be active.
R	Qualitative explanations for perceptions of insufficient activity included children having health problems and preferences for inactive pursuits , and parents having difficulty facilitating PA in poor weather and not always observing their child's PA level.
R	Social comparisons also influenced parental perceptions.
C	Strategies to improve parental awareness of child PA are needed.
C	Perceptions of child PA may be informed by child "busyness ," being unaware of activity levels , and social comparisons.
B	Capturing dimensions of physical activity relevant to patients may provide a unique perspective for clinical studies of chronically ill patients.
B	However , the quality of the development of existing instruments is uncertain.
B	The aim of this systematic review was to assess the development process of patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) instruments including their initial validation to measure physical activity in chronically ill or elderly patient populations.
M	We conducted a systematic literature search of electronic databases ( Medline , Embase , Psychinfo , Cinahl ) and hand searches.
M	We included studies describing the original development of fully structured instruments measuring dimensions of physical activity or related constructs in chronically ills or elderly.
M	We broadened the population to elderly because they are likely to share physical activity limitations.
M	At least two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening and full text assessment.
M	We evaluated instruments in terms of their aim , items identification and selection , domain development , test-retest reliability , internal consistency , validity and responsiveness.
R	Of the 2542 references from the database search and 89 from the hand search , 103 full texts which covered 104 instruments met our inclusion criteria.
R	For almost half of the instruments the authors clearly described the aim of the instruments before the scales were developed.
R	For item identification , patient input was used in 38% of the instruments and in 32% adaptation of existing scales and/or unsystematic literature searches were the only sources for the generation of items.
R	For item reduction , in 56% of the instruments patient input was used and in 33% the item reduction process was not clearly described.
R	Test-retest reliability was assessed for 61% , validity for 85% and responsiveness to change for 19% of the instruments.
C	Many PRO instruments exist to measure dimensions of physical activity in chronically ill and elderly patient populations , which reflects the relevance of this outcome.
C	However , the development processes often lacked definitions of the instruments' aims and patient input.
C	If PROs for physical activity were to be used in clinical trials more attention needs to be paid to the establishment of content validity through patient input and to the assessment of their evaluative measurement properties.
B	Considerable debate exists on whether the substantiation decision is a reliable measure for rates of maltreatment.
B	Studies have shown that risks among children victims of maltreatment versus children investigated but unsubstantiated are similar.
P	This paper aims to respond to two research questions: ( 1 ) Do most child maltreatment referrals , substantiated and unsubstantiated , come from the same neighborhoods?
P	( 2 ) Do substantiated and unsubstantiated referrals share the same neighborhood risk factors?
P	Participants and settings: We used geocoded data from substantiated ( n = 1799 ) and unsubstantiated ( n = 1638 ) child maltreatment referrals in Valencia , Spain ( 2004-2015 ).
P	As the neighborhood proxy , we used 552 Census block groups.
P	Neighborhood characteristics analyzed were: socioeconomic status , immigration concentration , residential instability , and public disorder and crime.
M	To study the geographical overlap of child maltreatment referrals , a Bayesian joint modeling approach was used.
M	To analyze the influence of neighborhood-level characteristics on risk , we used a Bayesian random-effects modeling approach.
R	For substantiated child maltreatment referrals , 90 % of the total between-area variation in risk is captured by the shared component , while for unsubstantiated child maltreatment referrals , the shared component was 88 %.
R	The correlation between substantiated and unsubstantiated risks of child maltreatment referrals was .80.
R	These risks were higher in neighborhoods with low levels of socioeconomic status , higher immigrant concentration , public disorder and crime.
C	Child maltreatment referrals , regardless of whether substantiated or unsubstantiated , overlap in the same disadvantaged neighborhoods.
C	This suggests that in these neighborhoods , families are at a higher risk of being investigated by child protective services suggesting a potential reporting bias.
B	anxiety during pregnancy and childbirth can increase risk of complications and interventions for both mother and infant.
B	Although considerable work has explored fear of childbirth and anxiety during labour and subsequent birth outcomes there has been less consideration of the role of more stable maternal personality upon childbirth.
B	Traits of neuroticism and extraversion are however predictive of health outcomes in other Fields potentially through biological , psychological and social mechanisms.
B	The aim of the current research was thus to examine the relationship between trait personality and childbirth experience.
M	seven hundred and fifty-Five mothers with an infant aged 0-6 months completed a self-report questionnaire including the Ten Item Personality Measure and descriptions of birth experience including mode of birth [vaginal vs. caesarean section] and complications [failure to progress , fetal distress , post-partum haemorrhage , assisted birth and severe tear].
R	personality traits were significantly associated with birth experience.
R	Specifically mothers scoring low in extraversion and emotional stability were significantly more likely to have a caesarean section and experience a number of complications during labour and birth including an assisted birth , fetal distress , failure to progress and a severe tear , findings were independent of maternal age , education and parity.
C	the personality traits of extraversion and emotional stability appear to facilitate likelihood of normal birth.
C	Potential explanations for this include biological ( physiological reactivity , pain thresholds , oxytocin and dopamine release ) and psychological ( coping mechanisms , social support , self-efficacy ) factors.
C	The findings have important implications for antenatal education and support during labour.

B	Although children with speech disorder are at increased risk of literacy impairments , many learn to read and spell without difficulty.
B	They are also a heterogeneous population in terms of the number and type of speech errors and their identified speech processing deficits.
B	One problem lies in determining which preschool children with speech disorder will have difficulties acquiring literacy skills.
P	Two studies are presented that investigate the relationship between speech disorders and literacy.
P	The first examined the phonological awareness abilities of children with different types of speech difficulties.
P	The second study investigated the literacy skills of children with a history of inconsistent speech disorder.
M	Experiment 1 measured the syllable segmentation , rhyme awareness and alliteration awareness of 61 preschool children: 46 with speech disorder ( 14 with delayed development , 17 who made consistent non-developmental errors , and 15 who made inconsistent errors ) and 15 typically developing controls.
M	Experiment 2 assessed the reading accuracy , spelling and phonological awareness abilities of nine 7-year-old children with a history of inconsistent phonological errors.
R	The first study indicated unexpected patterns of performance.
R	While the Delayed group performed less well than controls on all tasks , the Consistent group showed poor performance on rhyme and alliteration but appropriate performance on syllable segmentation.
R	The Inconsistent group performed most poorly on syllable segmentation but no differently from controls on the other two tasks.
R	The second study indicated that children with a history of inconsistent phonological disorder performed no differently from controls on measures of phonological awareness and reading , but less well on measures of spelling ability.
C	The results support classification of speech disorders and show a differentiation of phonological awareness skills across groups.
C	Children with consistent atypical speech errors have poor phonological awareness and are most at risk for literacy difficulties.
C	Those with inconsistent phonological disorder are at increased risk of spelling difficulties.
C	The findings indicate that phonological awareness and spelling skill are distinct processing systems and highlight the role of phonological assembly skills ( i.e. storing and/or retrieving phonological output plans ) in spelling output.
C	The interactive processes between reading and spelling are discussed.
B	Child maltreatment , removal from the home and foster care placement are all associated with poor physical and developmental outcomes for children.
B	Early Childhood Court ( ECC ) is a specialized , trauma-informed , team-based approach designed to meet the unique needs of young children and their families in the dependency court system.
P	The objective of the study was to evaluate the ECC program in 20 Florida circuits.
M	Participants in the evaluation were 53 ECC professionals ( e.g. , judges , attorneys , mental health providers , caseworkers , etc. ) and 9 parents and caregivers.
M	Focus groups were conducted in person , and interviews were conducted either in person or on the phone.
M	Interviews and focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with a hybrid deductive/inductive process using MAX QDA.
M	Two coders ( trained doctoral student researchers ) established inter-coder reliability with a Kappa greater than 0.80 and used an iterative process to discuss , refine , and describe each theme throughout the analysis.
R	Participants described who is involved in ECC and most discussions focused on professional versus parent/caregiver team members.
R	Participants also described how ECC is different from traditional dependency court and several themes , such as Child and Family Friendly , Judicial Leadership , and a Team-Based Approach , aligned with the national model.
R	Emergent themes were Relationships and Success.
C	Future research could explore the selection of parents into ECC.
B	Studies of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) awareness and HPV vaccine acceptability have included few non-white participants , making it difficult to explore ethnic differences.
B	This study assessed HPV awareness and HPV vaccine acceptability in a sample of women representing the major UK ethnic minority groups.
M	A cross-sectional study design was used to assess awareness of HPV and acceptability of HPV vaccination.
M	Participants were recruited using quota sampling to ensure adequate representation of ethnic minority women: Indian , Pakistani , Bangladeshi , Caribbean , African and Chinese women ( n = 750 ).
M	A comparison sample of white British women ( n = 200 ) was also recruited.
R	Awareness of HPV was lower among ethnic minority women than among white women ( 6-18% vs 39% in white women ) , and this was not explained by generational status or language spoken at home.
R	In a subsample who were mothers ( n = 601 ) , ethnicity and religion were strongly associated with acceptability of HPV vaccination.
R	Acceptability was highest among white mothers ( 63% ) and lowest among South Asians ( 11-25% ).
R	Those from non-Christian religions were also less accepting of the vaccine ( 17-34% ).
R	The most common barriers to giving HPV vaccination were a need for more information , sex-related concerns and concern about side-effects.
R	South Asian women were the most likely to cite sex-related concerns , and were also least likely to believe the vaccine would offer their daughters protection.
C	These findings suggest some cultural barriers that could be addressed in tailored information aimed at ethnic minority groups.
C	They also highlight the importance of recording ethnicity as part of HPV vaccine uptake data.
B	Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a genetic , neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities , growth hormone dysregulation , hyperphagia , increased risks of morbid obesity , compulsive behaviors , and irritability.
B	As aberrant serotonergic functioning is strongly implicated in PWS , we examined associations between the PWS phenotype and polymorphisms in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 ( TPH2 ) , the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin in the brain.
M	Ninety-two individuals with PWS aged 4 to 50 years ( M = 21.97 ) were genotyped for the TPH2 G703-T polymorphism.
M	IQ testing was conducted in offspring , and parents completed questionnaires that tapped their child's compulsivity , hyperphagia , and other behavior problems.
R	As expected , the frequency of G/T or T/T polymorphisms in participants with PWS ( 39% ) was similar to rates found in the general population ( 38% ).
R	Compared to those with a homozygous ( G/G ) genotype , individuals with a T allele had significantly higher hyperphagic behavior , drive , and severity scores , and they also had a younger age of onset of hyperphagia.
R	Those with a T allele also had higher IQ scores than their counterparts.
R	Females with a T allele had significantly higher internalizing symptoms , primarily anxiety and depression , than all others.
C	TPH2 G/T polymorphisms , and presumed loss of enzyme function , were associated with specific aspects of the PWS phenotype.
C	Aberrant serotonergic functioning is strongly implicated in hyperphagia in PWS , and females with TPH2 T alleles may be at higher risk for affective or mood disorders.
C	Findings hold promise for examining other serotonin-altering genes in PWS , and for future serotonin-altering treatment trials.
B	Internalized stigma is a significant difficulty for those who experience psychosis , but it has never been conceptualized using cognitive theory.
P	The aim of this paper is to outline a cognitive model conceptualizing internalized stigma experienced by people who also experience psychosis.
M	Previous literature is reviewed , critiqued and synthesized to develop the model.
M	It draws upon previous social cognitive models of internalized stigma and integrates cognitive behavioural theory and social mentality theory.
R	This paper identifies key cognitive , behavioural and emotional processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of internalized stigma , whilst also recognizing the central importance of cultural context in creating negative stereotypes of psychosis.
R	Moreover , therapeutic strategies to alleviate internalized stigma are identified.
R	A case example is explored and a formulation and brief intervention plan was developed in order to illustrate the model in practice.
C	An integrative cognitive model is presented , which can be used to develop individualized case formulations , which can guide cognitive behavioural interventions targeting internalized stigma in those who experience psychosis.
C	More research is required to examine the efficacy of such interventions.
C	In addition , it is imperative to continue to research interventions that create change in stigma at a societal level.
B	It is often suggested that neighbourhood access to food retailers affects the dietary patterns of local residents , but this hypothesis has not been adequately researched.
B	We examine the association between neighbourhood accessibility to supermarkets and convenience stores and individuals' consumption of fruit and vegetables in New Zealand.
M	Using geographical information systems , travel times from the population-weighted centroid of each neighbourhood to the closest supermarket and convenience store were calculated for 38 350 neighbourhoods.
M	These neighbourhood measures of accessibility were appended to the 2002-3 New Zealand Health Survey of 12 529 adults.
R	The consumption of the recommended daily intake of fruit was not associated with living in a neighbourhood with better access to supermarkets or convenience stores.
R	Similarly , access to supermarkets was not related to vegetable intake.
R	However , individuals in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the best access to convenience stores had 25% ( OR 0.75 , 95% CI 0.60% to 0.93% ) lower odds of eating the recommended vegetable intake compared to individuals in the base category ( worst access ).
C	This study found little evidence that poor locational access to food retail provision is associated with lower fruit and vegetable consumption.
C	However , before rejecting the commonsense notion that neighbourhood access to fruit and vegetables affects personal consumption , research that measures fruit and vegetable access more precisely and directly is required.
B	Shank3 , a post-synaptic density protein involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor tethering and dendritic spine rearrangement , is implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.
B	We hypothesized that elevated baseline plasma Shank3 levels might predict antidepressant response to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine.
M	Twenty-nine subjects with bipolar depression received a double-blind , randomized , subanesthetic dose ( .5 mg/kg ) ketamine infusion.
M	Of the patients for whom Shank3 levels were collected , 15 completed baseline 3-Tesla MRl and 17 completed post-ketamine [F-18]-FDG PET.
R	Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 ( r=.39 , p=.047 ) , 2 ( r=-.45 , p=.02 ) , and 3 ( r=-.42 , p=.03 ) and were associated with larger average ( r =.58 , p=.02 ) and right amygdala volume ( r=.65 , p=.009 ).
R	Greater baseline Shank3 also predicted increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus ( r=.51 , p=.04 ) and amygdala ( r=.58 , p=.02 ).
C	Limitations include the small sample size , inability to assess the source of peripheral Shank3 , and the lack of a placebo group for baseline Shank3 levels and comparative structural/functional neuroimaging.
C	Shank3 is a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine that correlates with baseline amygdala volume and increased glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus.

B	Survival from in-hospital cardiac arrest is poor.
B	Clinical features , including abnormal vital signs , often indicate patient deterioration prior to severe adverse events.
B	Early warning systems and rapid response teams are commonly used to assist the health profession in the identification and management of the deteriorating patient.
B	Education programs are widely used in the implementation of these systems.
B	The effectiveness of the education is unknown.
P	The aims of this study were to identify: ( i ) the evidence supporting educational effectiveness in the recognition and management of the deteriorating patient and ( ii ) outcome measures used to evaluate educational effectiveness.
M	A mixed methods systematic review of the literature was conducted using studies published between 2002 and 2014.
M	Included studies were assessed for quality and data were synthesized thematically , while original data are presented in tabular form.
R	Twenty-three studies were included in the review.
R	Most educational programs were found to be effective reporting significant positive impacts upon learners , patient outcomes and organisational systems.
R	Outcome measures related to: i learners , for example knowledge and performance , ii systems , including activation and responses of rapid response teams , and iii patients , including patient length of stay and adverse events.
R	All but one of the programs used blended teaching with >87% including medium to high fidelity simulation.
R	In situ simulation was employed in two of the interventions.
R	The median program time was eight hours.
R	The longest program lasted 44 h however one of the most educationally effective programs was based upon a 40 min simulation program.
C	Educational interventions designed to improve the recognition and management of patient deterioration can improve learner outcomes when they incorporate medium to high-fidelity simulation.
C	High-fidelity simulation has demonstrated effectiveness when delivered in brief sessions lasting only forty minutes.
C	In situ simulation has demonstrated sustained positive impact upon the real world implementation of rapid response systems.
C	Outcome measures should include knowledge and skill developments but there are important benefits in understanding patient outcomes.

B	The dose-response relationship between volume of physical activity and incidence of major vascular events at older age is unclear.
B	We aimed to investigate this association in a cohort of older men.
M	For this prospective cohort study , 7564 men aged 65-83 years and without prior vascular disease were recruited in 1996-99 from the general population in Perth , Western Australia.
M	Men were followed up using the Western Australian Data Linkage System to identify deaths and hospitalisations.
M	During mean follow-up of 11 ( SD 4 ) years , there were 1557 first major vascular events: 833 ischaemic heart disease events , 551 stroke events and 173 other vascular events.
M	Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios ( adjusted for age , education and smoking ) for incidence of major vascular events by volume of baseline recreational physical activity ( measured in metabolic equivalent [MET] hours per week ).
R	Hazard ratios among men who performed 0 , 1-14 , 15-24 , 25-39 , >= 40 MET-hours per week of recreational physical activity were 1.00 ( 95 % CI 0.91-1.10 ; referent ) , 0.88 ( 0.79-1.00 ) , 0.81 ( 0.72-0.91 ) , 0.81 ( 0.72-0.91 ) and 0.80 ( 0.71-0.89 ) , respectively ( P ( trend ) = 0.006 ).
R	The association was slightly attenuated with further adjustment for BMI.
R	There was evidence of stronger associations at older ages and greater intensity of activity , but no evidence of effect modification by smoking , alcohol intake or BMI.
R	There was also no evidence that the association varied by type of vascular event.
C	Among men aged over 65 years , there was a curvilinear association between recreational physical activity and incidence of major vascular events , with an inverse association up to about 20 MET-hours per week ( equivalent to 1 h of non-vigorous , or half an hour of vigorous , physical activity per day ) and no evidence of further reductions in risk thereafter.
B	Previous surveys of organizations that support the development of evidence-informed health policies have focused on organizations that produce clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) or undertake health technology assessments ( HTAs ).
B	Only rarely have surveys focused at least in part on units that directly support the use of research evidence in developing health policy on an international , national , and state or provincial level ( i.e. , government support units , or GSUs ) that are in some way successful or innovative or that support the use of research evidence in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ).
M	We drew on many people and organizations around the world , including our project reference group , to generate a list of organizations to survey.
M	We modified a questionnaire that had been developed originally by the Appraisal of Guidelines , Research and Evaluation in Europe ( AGREE ) collaboration and adapted one version of the questionnaire for organizations producing CPGs and HTAs , and another for GSUs.
M	We sent the questionnaire by email to 176 organizations and followed up periodically with non-responders by email and telephone.
R	We received completed questionnaires from 152 ( 86% ) organizations.
R	More than one-half of the organizations ( and particularly HTA agencies ) reported that examples from other countries were helpful in establishing their organization.
R	A higher proportion of GSUs than CPG- or HTA-producing organizations involved target users in the selection of topics or the services undertaken.
R	Most organizations have few ( five or fewer ) full-time equivalent ( FTE ) staff.
R	More than four-fifths of organizations reported providing panels with or using systematic reviews.
R	GSUs tended to use a wide variety of explicit valuation processes for the research evidence , but none with the frequency that organizations producing CPGs , HTAs , or both prioritized evidence by its quality.
R	Between one-half and two-thirds of organizations do not collect data systematically about uptake , and roughly the same proportions do not systematically evaluate their usefulness or impact in other ways.
C	The findings from our survey , the most broadly based of its kind , both extend or clarify the applicability of the messages arising from previous surveys and related documentary analyses , such as how the 'principles of evidence-based medicine dominate current guideline programs' and the importance of collaborating with other organizations.
C	The survey also provides a description of the history , structure , processes , outputs , and perceived strengths and weaknesses of existing organizations from which those establishing or leading similar organizations can draw.
B	Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) metabolizes catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ).
B	A common polymorphism in the COMT gene ( COMT val158met ) has pleiotropic effects on cognitive and emotional processing.
B	The met allele has been associated with enhanced cognitive processing but impaired emotional processing relative to the val allele.
M	We genotyped healthy , white men in relation to the COMT val158met polymorphism.
M	They were given a single 4 mg dose of the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor ( NRI ) reboxetine or placebo in a randomized , double-blind between-subjects model and then completed an emotional memory task 2 hours later.
R	We included 75 men in the study ; 41 received reboxetine and 34 received placebo.
R	In the placebo group , met/met carriers did not demonstrate the usual memory advantage for emotional stimuli that was observed in val carriers.
R	Reboxetine restored this emotional enhancement of memory in met/met carriers , but had no significant effect in val carriers.
C	We studied only men , thus limiting the generalizability of our findings.
C	We also relied on self-reported responses to screening questions to establish healthy volunteer status , and in spite of the double-blind design , participants were significantly better than chance at identifying their intervention allocation.
C	Emotional memory is impaired in healthy met homozygotes and selectively improved in this group by reboxetine.
C	This has potential translational implications for the use of reboxetine , which is currently licensed as an antidepressant in several countries , and edivoxetine , a new selective NRI currently in development.
B	Existing literature supports the potential role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia , depression , anxiety disorders , substance use disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders.
B	Role of oxidative stress has also been implicated in obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ).
M	Our study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital of North India.
M	This cross-sectional observational study aimed at evaluating the markers of oxidative stress ( Superoxide dismutase , Glutathione Peroxidase , Catalase , Malondialdehyde , serum cortisol ) in three groups - patients with OCD , their non-affected first degree relatives , and healthy controls.
M	Markers of oxidative stress were estimated in all 30 participants in each group.
R	Significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde and lower levels of plasma catalase , superoxide dismutase & glutathione peroxidase were found in patients , compared to their first degree relatives and healthy controls.
R	Levels of plasma catalase , superoxide dismutase & glutathione peroxidase in first degree relatives were also significantly lower than healthy controls.
C	Higher levels of oxidative stress markers are associated with OCD and their first-degree relatives.
C	The correlational nature of the present study , and the lack of a psychiatric control group , however , do not allow for conclusions regarding causation or the findings' specificity to OCD.
B	Eating behaviour can be viewed as a continuum , ranging from extremely restrictive to extremely disinhibited eating.
B	Valid and reliable instruments are needed to ensure detection of individuals with risk for eating disorders ( ED ).
B	Self-report methods are the most feasible , cost , and time efficient.
B	One of the most widely used self-reports is the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire ( EDE-Q ).
P	The aim of this study was to develop a Finnish version of the EDE-Q version 6.0 and to assess its psychometric properties in adolescents , adults , and ED patients.
M	The present study utilized data from three different samples: adolescents ( n=242 ) , adults ( n=133 ) , and ED patients ( n=52 ).
M	The patient group comprised different EDs , but individual ED diagnoses were not studied separately.
M	Data was collected January 2014 through June 2015.
R	The Finnish version of the EDE-Q showed acceptable-to-excellent internal consistency on all sub-scales in all three samples and discriminated patients from healthy individuals.
R	Female participants generally scored higher than male and sex differences were more pronounced among the younger age group.
C	The Finnish version of the EDE-Q can , based on this study , be regarded as reliable , valid , and functional.
C	Further studies are needed to evaluate the population norms and to test the validity in individual ED diagnoses.
B	Health behavioral patterns , especially eating patterns , established in childhood often carry over into adulthood , and some of the unhealthy ones are later associated with adult morbidity and mortality.
B	Recently , a few nutrition and food safety education programs have been implemented in primary and junior high schools in China.
P	This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a school-based nutrition and food safety education program among primary and junior high school students in China.
M	A mixed study design incorporating an intervention study and a quantitative survey was conducted for this research.
M	With stratified cluster sampling , students from the 5( th ) and 6( th ) grade in one primary school and the 7( th ) and 8( th ) grade in one junior high school in Chongqing , China , were all selected and separated randomly into an intervention group ( n = 501 ) and a control group ( n = 522 ).
M	Effectiveness evaluation investigations were performed at the initial time and nine-month follow-up ( n = 472 ) , respectively.
M	Effectiveness of pre-/post-intervention and nine-month follow-up changes in scores of nutrition knowledge and food safety was assessed using a two-tailed t-test and analysis of variance.
R	Nutrition knowledge scores for the intervention group were mean 9.03 , SD2.75 at the baseline , and 14.70 +/- 3.28 after intervention.
R	There was a significant improvement ( t = 29.78 , p < 0.01 ).
R	The nine-month follow-up knowledge scores of the intervention group were 12.35 +/- 2.89 , which were lower than the immediately after the intervention group ( t = 12.40 , p<0.01 ) , but higher than those of the baseline level ( t = 18.04 , p < 0.01 ).
R	Food safety scores of the post-intervention were higher ( p < 0.01 ) than that of the control group in both pre-intervention and nine-month follow-up.
R	The control group had no significant change in the pre-post intervention.
C	It is feasible and effective to improve nutrition and food safety knowledge among primary and junior high school students through school-based nutrition and food safety education programs.
B	This descriptive , retrospective study examined patient and event characteristics associated with multiple seclusion and restraint ( SR ).
P	The goal was to identify patient characteristics of multiple seclusion and restraint users to improve patient care and decrease the need for seclusion or restraint.
M	Medical charts were reviewed for 63 patients hospitalized at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 2006 and December 2008 who had been secluded or restrained multiple times during a single hospitalization.
M	Patient characteristics and events associated with multiple SR use were examined.
M	Characteristics were then compared with those who had a single ( n = 110 ) and no SR events ( n = 3 ,585 ) during hospitalization in those study years.
R	Compared with patients with no SR events , those with multiple SR events were more likely to be male , have histories of aggression before and during previous hospitalizations , and have longer lengths of stay.
R	Patients with any SR event were more likely to have cognitive impairment and have been admitted involuntarily.
C	Results highlight the need for practice changes targeting subgroups of patients at elevated risk for multiple SR use.
B	Prodromal syndromes often begin in adolescence - a period of neurodevelopmental changes and heightened stress sensitivity.
B	Research has shown elevated stress and cortisol in individuals at clinical high risk ( CHR ) for psychosis.
B	This cross-sectional study examined relations of age and pubertal status with cortisol and self-reported stress in healthy controls ( HCs ) and CHR adolescents.
B	It was hypothesized that the relations of age and pubertal stage with cortisol and stress would be more pronounced in CHR youth.
M	Participants were 93 HCs and 348 CHR adolescents from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study ( NAPLS ).
M	At baseline , measures of stress ( Daily Stress Inventory-DSI ) , Tanner stage ( TS ) , and salivary cortisol were obtained.
R	ANCOVA revealed increased DSI scores with age for both groups , and higher DSI scores in CHR adolescents than HCs , with a more pronounced difference for females.
R	Contrary to prediction , with age controlled , HCs showed greater TS-related DSI increases.
R	Analysis of cortisol showed no significant interactions , but a main effect of age and a trend toward higher cortisol in the CHR group.
R	Correlations of cortisol with TS were higher in HC than CHR group.
C	Stress measures increased with age in HC and CHR adolescents , and DSI scores also increased with TS in HCs.
C	The results do not support a more pronounced age or TS increase in stress measures in CHR adolescents , but instead suggest that stress indices tend to be elevated earlier in adolescence in the CHR group.
C	Potential determinants of findings and future directions are discussed.

B	Despite increasing popularity and mounting evidence for teacher collaboration as a lever for school improvement , reported changes in teaching associated with collaboration are often subtle and incremental , rarely involving substantial shifts in instructional practice called for by advocates of deeper learning and next-generation standards.
B	One reason more expansive teaching changes remain elusive is that existing "horizons of observation" constrain possibilities teacher teams consider and solutions they develop while collaborating to improve teaching and learning.
P	This case study of two secondary school teacher teams explored the potential of collaborative partnerships with outside content experts ( OCEs ) for infusing new resources and perspectives that move beyond persistent images of classroom instruction.
M	The study context was the Learning Studios model from the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future ( NCTAF ) , in which interdisciplinary teacher teams partnered with local scientists and researchers to develop and implement yearlong project investigations with students.
M	The study used a qualitative case study design , including live observations and narrative transcription of team planning and design sessions , interviews , focus groups , and analysis of web-based interactions to develop rich narrative descriptions of the two partnership cases during the 2014-2015 academic year.
M	We also compared and analyzed prominent patterns of OCE facilitative action across the two cases.
R	Coding and analyses revealed several pivotal episodes of partnership interactions with clear evidence of OCE influence on teacher instructional plans.
R	Cross-case analyses point to three OCE facilitative actions that preceded these effects-adapting expertise to local needs , following up between meetings , and judiciously applying pressure.
C	The pivotal episodes we captured provide some initial evidence to support previous researchers' hypotheses that extended collaborative engagements can facilitate teacher learning in ways not readily achieved through traditional partnership models.
C	The joint productive activity and depth of interaction observed in these cases opened up several opportunities to infuse knowledge and insights seldom documented in other teacher-expert studies involving loosely structured programs or short-lived externships.
C	The two cases also provide initial evidence that outside experts can help to expand the horizons of possibilities teachers consider during instructional planning.
C	Although these examples are instructive , we do not believe the reported effects are of sufficient magnitude or duration to be labeled "transformative shifts in practice."
C	We also cannot say whether these initial changes in instructional plans translated into changes in classroom teaching or improvements in student learning.
C	These remain important questions for future research.
B	Medication therapy management ( MTM ) services provide essential reviews of drug regimens and are increasingly recognized as beneficial to patient safety , improved health outcomes , and cost savings.
P	To assess patient behavioral outcomes from an MTM service , including actions following receipt of a pharmacist report.
M	A retrospective analysis of an MTM program at the Sanford Center for Aging ( NV , USA ) was conducted.
M	Outcome measures included whether the patient discussed the review with the physician , whether any changes in the client's drug regimen occurred , and whether the client feels more knowledgeable about his or her medications.
M	Predictor variables included basic demographics , prescription insurance status , number of prescriptions taken , self-reported health status , and use of medications considered to be high risk.
M	The analysis plan involved the use of multivariate logistic regression models.
R	The odds of discussing the medication review with physicians , making changes recommended in the report , and both discussing and making a change were 65% , 60% , and 67% , respectively , lower among those below poverty level than among those above poverty level ; 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ): 0.15 , 0.80 ; 0.18 , 0.85 ; and 0.15 , 0.73 , respectively.
R	The odds of those using high-risk drugs of making changes in drug regimens , and of discussing with physicians and making changes together , were 2 times higher than the odds of those not using these drugs , 95% CIs: 1.02 , 4.31 and 1.20 , 4.87 , respectively.
R	The likelihood of those reporting good or excellent health of doing the combination of discussing the MTM report with physicians and to make a drug regimen change was 2 times greater than for those reporting poor to fair health , 95% CI: 1.08 , 3.65.
R	Gender , ethnicity , age group , rural status , prescription drug insurance , and high polypharmacy were not significant factors for acting on the medication review in the adjusted model.
C	MTM services are associated with enhanced patient self-advocacy , but like other interventions , they are constrained by social disparities.
C	Greater attention to the resources of target populations to respond to pharmacy services is merited.

P	This study quantifies and describes perceptions of susceptibility and severity of diabetes ; cultural beliefs , barriers , and knowledge about diabetes ; and social stigma associated with diabetes in an Eastern Appalachian Kentucky population.
M	A 55-item intercept survey was administered in 2 large retail outlets in Eastern Kentucky.
M	Individuals were screened to ensure an age range of 25-55 and an "at-risk" diabetes status ( according to the American Diabetes Association's requirements ).
M	Descriptive statistics and t tests were used to describe the data.
M	Differences across demographic variables were tested via an analysis of variance.
R	Most respondents agreed that diabetes is a growing problem in their community , yet the overall levels of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity were lower than expected ( susceptibility = 3.88 on a 5-point scale and severity = 3.5 ).
R	Women , however , perceived higher susceptibility than men.
R	Social stigma did not emerge as a strong concern or worry.
R	The only group differences noted focused on barriers to care and disease management.
R	Specifically , men without a family history of diabetes were significantly less likely than men with a family history to agree that the community should help persons living with diabetes manage their disease ( P = .034 ).
C	There appears to be a gap between actual and perceived risk levels for developing diabetes.
C	Additionally , it seems that diabetes is viewed as an intrapersonal issue rather than a community-level problem.
C	Yet , for men , a personal experience with the disease may be enough to change the belief that diabetes is an individual problem.
B	Past reports on the speech production of individuals with Williams syndrome ( WS ) suggest that their prosody is anomalous and may lead to challenges in spoken communication.
B	While existing prosodic assessments confirm that individuals with WS fail to use prosodic emphasis to express contrast , those reports typically lack detailed phonetic analysis of speech data.
B	The present study examines the acoustic properties of speech prosody , aiming for the future development of targeted speech interventions.
P	The study examines the three primary acoustic correlates of prosodic emphasis ( duration , intensity , F0 ) and determines whether individuals with WS have difficulty in producing all or a particular set of the three prosodic cues.
M	Speech produced by 12 individuals with WS and 12 chronological age ( CA )-matched typically developing individuals were recorded.
M	A sequential picture-naming task elicited production of target phrases in three contexts: ( 1 ) no contrast: gorilla with a racket.
M	rabbit with a balloon ; ( 2 ) contrast on the animal: fox with a balloon.
M	rabbit with a balloon ; and ( 3 ) contrast on the object: rabbit with a ball.
M	rabbit with a balloon.
M	The three acoustic correlates of prosodic prominence ( duration , intensity and F0 ) were compared across the three referential contexts.
R	The two groups exhibited striking similarities in their use of word duration and intensity for expressing contrast.
R	Both groups showed the reduction and enhancement of final lengthening , and the enhancement and reduction of intensity difference for the animal contrast and for the object contrast conditions , respectively.
R	The two groups differed in their use of F0: the CA group produced higher F0 for the animal than for the object regardless of the context , and this difference was enhanced when the animal noun was contrastive.
R	In contrast , the WS group produced higher F0 for the object than for the animal when the object was contrastive.
C	The present data contradict previous assessment results that report a lack of prosodic skills to mark contrast in individuals with WS.
C	The methodological differences that may account for this variability are discussed.
C	The present data suggest that individuals with WS produce appropriate prosodic cues to express contrast , although their use of pitch may be somewhat atypical.
C	Additional data and future speech comprehension studies will determine whether pitch modulation can be targeted for speech intervention in individuals with WS.
B	While hypochondriasis has a relatively low prevalence , there are indications that hypochondriacal characteristics below the diagnostic threshold are more commonly present.
P	How prevalent are hypochondriacal characteristics in psychotherapeutic outpatients?
P	Can hypochondriacal symptoms be explained by existing somatic diseases?
P	Which risk factors could be significant?
M	85 psychotherapeutic outpatients were studied in regard to the existence of hypochondriacal characteristics , experience with diseases and traumatic experiences during childhood.
R	Depending on the cut-off criterion , distinct disease-related fears could be found in 24-34% of the patients.
R	Only a minor portion ( 6-10% ) could be explained by a bad health status.
R	Furthermore , the number of deceased family members was shown to be potentially relevant with respect to hypochondriacal symptoms.
C	Hypochondriacal characteristics should be taken into stronger account in the ambulatory psychotherapeutic treatment of patients due to the high frequency with which patients report them.
B	The relationship between clinically assessed and free-living walking is unclear.
B	Cadence ( steps/min ) can be measured accurately under both conditions using modern technologies , thus providing a common measurement metric.
B	Therefore , the purpose of this study was to compare clinical and free-living cadence in older adults.
M	15 community-dwelling older adults ( 7 men , 8 women ; 61-81 years ) completed GAITRite-determined normal and dual-task walks and wore objective monitors for 1 week.
M	Descriptive data included gait speed ( cm/sec ) , steps/day , as well as cadence.
M	Nonparametric tests evaluated differences between normal and dual-task walks and between accelerometer- and pedometer-determined steps/day.
M	Free-living time detected above clinically determined cadence was calculated.
R	Participants crossed the GAITRite at 125.56 +/- 15.51 cm/sec ( men ) and 107.93 +/- 9.41 steps/min ( women ) during their normal walk and at 112.59 +/- 17.90 cm/sec and 103.10 +/- 1.30 steps/min during their dual-task walk ( differences between walks P < .05 ).
R	Overall , they averaged 7159 +/- 2480 ( accelerometer ) and 7813 +/- 2919 steps/day ( pedometer ; difference NS ).
R	On average , < 10 min/day was spent above clinically determined cadences.
C	High-functioning , community-dwelling older adults are capable of walking at relatively high cadences ( ie , > 100 steps/min ).
C	However , the same behavior appears to be uncommon in daily life , even for a minute.
B	Internationally there is a lack of measurement on the impact of childcare on people who use drugs.
P	The aim of this article was to longitudinally measure drug use , familial and social status and criminal involvement between parents and nonparents who use heroin and have children in their care.
M	From 2003 to 2006 , 404 participants were recruited to the Research Outcome Study in Ireland Evaluating Drug Treatment Effectiveness ( ROSIE ) as part of a longitudinal cohort study design.
M	Participants completed the Maudsley Addiction Profile and 88% ( n = 356 ) completed interviews at the 3-year period.
M	One way between groups ANOVA with post hoc tests and backward , stepwise multiple regression were employed for analysis.
R	At follow-up , parents who had children in their care used heroin ( p = .004 ) , illicit methadone ( p .001 ) and cocaine ( p = .024 ) on fewer days than those who had no children , or those who had children but did not have children in their care.
R	These differences were not observed at intake.
R	Living with someone at intake who used drugs was found to be significantly associated with increased heroin ( p .001 ) , benzodiazepine ( p = .039 ) , and tobacco ( p = .030 ) use at 3years.
R	Furthermore , a change in childcare status to caring for a child was associated with increased cannabis use ( p = .025 ).
C	While caring for children was associated with reduced heroin use at 3years , living with a person who used at intake removed this effect , thus indicating that while individual based addiction theories reflected observed outcomes , social network connectedness was more influential.
B	This study was designed to compare two methods ( direct measurement of exposure and quasi-induced exposure ) for assessing the effect of age and sex on the risk of being involved in a car crash in Spain.
M	Spanish crash rates ( per 10 ,000 ,000 driver-km ) for age and sex groups of drivers aged 18-64 years old were obtained for 2004-2007 , using information from the Spanish General Traffic Office ( census of reported car crashes ) and the Spanish Household Survey on Alcohol and Drugs ( estimate of the mean km driven for each car driver ).
M	The rate ratios estimated by direct exposure estimates were compared to those obtained with the quasi-induced exposure method , which compares the age and sex of responsible and non-responsible drivers involved in the same clean collision ( in which only one of the drivers committed a driving infraction ).
R	Both methods detected an increased risk of involvement in a crash for the youngest ( 18-20 years ) and the oldest drivers ( 60-64 years ).
R	compared to middle-aged drivers ( 45-49 years ).
