History	Rising from the ruins of a post-1918 Austria shed of its monarchical leadership and much of its former territory, the Salzburg Festival acquired a symbolic authority during the First Austrian Republic that continues to ensure its privileged place in Austrian politics and culture to this day. At the core of this privileged place are two signature legacies that, while grounded in the festival's prewar history, fortified a particular agenda of the Second Austrian Republic in defining Austrian history and national identity in the decades following World War II. The first, as expressed in 1919 by the festival's most articulate cofounder, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, is that with its Salzburg setting, the festival should be understood as situated in the heart of the heart of Europe, a place where the antitheses of Central European geography (German and Slavic, German and Italian), social class (commoner and elite), and aesthetic genre (dramatic theater and opera) encounter one another only to be dissolved through transcendence in an organic unity.
Development Studies	This paper assesses two innovative development financing modelsspecialised global partnership funds (e.g. The Global Fund) and market-based approaches (e.g. GlobalGiving). Via a simple typology of development financing approaches these models are shown to contain distinctive and new elements. They have definite strengths, particularly in raising funds as well as unbundling fundraising from design and implementation. However, these models are not panaceas and replicate many weaknesses of traditional approaches to foreign aid. Donors should carefully consider the merits of supporting new financing structures relative to including innovative design features within existing aid programmes.

Family Studies	This paper investigates gender differences in time on housework with relationship dissolution. Using longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (2001-2005) and a linear mixed modeling approach, we examine changes in housework hours before and after separation from marriage or cohabitation. The results indicate that relationship type affects change in housework hours of men and women following separation. Men's housework time increase with separation from marriage, but not from cohabitation. Women's housework time decrease after separation from both cohabitation and marriage. We also find evidence of anticipatory behavior where women who separate do less housework hours prior to separation than those who remain partnered. The paper concludes that gender equality is most likely in the absence of a co-residential partner.
Social Issues	The proliferation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) since the 1970s has generated a wealth of research as to the causes and implications of the rise of this sector. Public awareness of NGOs and their activities has grown as well, at least in part due to increased media coverage of the organizations and the situations to which they respond. Although NGOs are not new to global polity, media attention to them as a sector only really began to take off in the 1990s. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis of two international newspapers from 1985-2010, this study explores the legitimation process of NGOs and examines the role of categorization and labeling in this process. The results show that the establishment of a distinct label in the media served to propel cognitive recognition of NGOs, and that media coverage reflects changes in cognitive legitimacy over time.
Law	This article focuses on the legal geography of gated communities. Sociolegal research has paid comparatively little attention to how specific material forms fare within legal contexts. Drawing on work in legal geography and in science and technology studies, this article isolates judicial decisions that deal with the borders of gated communities from other cases involving private homeowner associations. By focusing on these boundary disputes in which outsiders are excluded from the area, this article finds that courts are resisting the localism presented by gated communities and are instead articulating a social imaginary in which the landscape flows uninterrupted by the exclusionary presence of gates. In contrast to the privatopia literature, this article finds that courts are not complicit in promoting neoliberal visions of community. The social imaginary being developed by courts resists the spatial differentiation of gated communities, producing in its place a thoroughly modern polity in which legal, economic, and political relations flow easily between those inside and outside the gate.
Management	Recent highly publicized cases of scientific misconduct have raised concerns about its consequences for academic careers. Previous and anecdotal evidence suggests that these reach far beyond the fraudulent scientist and (his or) her career, affecting coauthors and institutions. Here we show that the negative effects of scientific misconduct spill over to uninvolved prior collaborators: compared to a control group, prior collaborators of misconducting scientists, who have no connection to the misconduct case, are cited 89% less often afterwards. We suggest that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is stigmatization by mere association. The result suggests that scientific misconduct generates large indirect costs in the form of mistrust towards a wider range of research findings than was previously assumed. The far-reaching fallout of misconduct implies that potential whistleblowers might be disinclined to make their concerns public in order to protect their own reputation and career.
Ethnic Studies	In this article Blijdenstein introduces recent reflections on secular liberalism's treatment of religion and critically discusses those genealogical approaches that centre on uncovering the hidden theological roots of the liberal framework. The claim that contemporary liberal ideas on, for example, religion, secularity and tolerance are in fact 'Christian' or 'Protestant' comes with its own set of problems, as it hides from view the importance of the different political and historical contexts in which these categories have played, and continue to play, a role. Blijdenstein formulates three caveats on critiques that focus on the persistence of theological categories.
Urban Studies	Candidates for municipal office collect millions of dollars to fund their campaigns. While previous research about local fundraising coalitions investigates the role of specific interest groups-for example, real estate professionals and developers-and donors outside the political jurisdiction, there has been little systematic investigation of individual donors classified by the size of their contribution or their geographic concentration within the city itself. In this article, we draw on administrative records of campaign contributions from the 2013 Seattle elections to answer two questions about the financing of municipal elections. First, drawing on research from federal elections, we ask whether candidates build fundraising coalitions comprised primarily of small-dollar donors or whether they rely heavily on high-dollar donors to fund their campaigns. In Seattle, we find that only one-fifth of donors in the mayoral election contributed at least $500, but their contributions account for 55% of the money raised in the election. Next, we ask how concentrated campaign contributors are within Seattle neighborhoods. Candidates collected nearly 25% of their funds from the wealthiest 10% of neighborhoods. By pointing to an outsized role for high-ollar donors and donors concentrated in affluent neighborhoods, this article identifies a critical dimension of representational distortion in municipal elections. In doing so, it opens a new window into the local campaign finance system-an aspect of our political process that has been largely overlooked in research on campaigns and elections.
Urban Studies	"Urban sustainability transitions have been increasingly imperative to address global environmental challenges, and local governments are expected to play a critical role. There is a pressing need to explore local governments"" underlying motivations and their impacts on governing practices. Taking China as an example, this paper builds an incentive matrix to distinguish the levels of local governments"" economic interest and environmental interest in specific low-carbon innovations and investigates how different incentive typologies affect their governing practices. By comparing four Chinese municipal governments"" incentives and governing practices in promoting solar water heater adoption, this paper finds that Chinese local governments"" environmental incentive is still not compelling or stable enough, while governments that are motivated by economic interests would resort to more substantial governance practices to promote the low-carbon innovations. These results indicate potential in latecomer cities in developing both economic and environmental incentives towards low-carbon innovations because green activities could also be favored if they are well aligned with local economic development."
Urban Studies	This research is a descriptive assessment of the growth and stability of racially integrated neighborhoods in New York City from 1970 to 2010. The focus of our analysis is on the inclusion of blacks in these integrated areas given that current scholarship has shown that in other venues, Asians and Hispanics are socially separating themselves from blacks and aligning themselves with whites. The predominant pattern of racial integration in the city, and one that appears to have become more stable over time, combines whites, Asians and, to a lesser extent, Hispanics, but typically excludes blacks. We conclude by placing our findings within the broader literature on the emerging black/non-black color line, where Asians and Hispanics are increasingly aligned with whites while distancing themselves from blacks.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This study was examined the new money generated from Formula One Grand Prix (F1) and the economic impacts of this new money on the host economy using input-output analysis. We find that the impact of the new money from non-local attendees or international attendees is more pronounced compared to that from local attendees. Also, F1 event appears to influence on sports-related industry as well as other industries such as manufacturing industry. Our findings suggest that the host cities should focus on increasing the non-local and international attendees in order to enhance the economic impacts of a sport event.
Development Studies	Large-scale mineral extraction is often accompanied by local conflicts, reflecting the fact that affected communities feel the costs of development but enjoy few of its benefits. Much of this conflict could be mitigated if communities could influence the design of projects and of management systems intended to minimise their impacts. This paper examines the potential role of community-controlled impact assessment, combined with negotiation of binding agreements between communities and developers, to allow affected communities to shape the impacts of extractive projects. It considers the wider political factors that must be addressed if these mechanisms are to be effective.
Ethics	"This article deals with a modern disease of academic science that consists of an enormous increase in the number of scientific publications without a corresponding advance of knowledge. Findings are sliced as thin as salami and submitted to different journals to produce more papers. If we consider academic papers as a kind of scientific 'currency' that is backed by gold bullion in the central bank of 'true' science, then we are witnessing an article-inflation phenomenon, a scientometric bubble that is most harmful for science and promotes an unethical and antiscientific culture among researchers. The main problem behind the scenes is that the impact factor is used as a proxy for quality. Therefore, not only for convenience, but also based on ethical principles of scientific research, we adhere to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment when it emphasizes ""the need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics in funding, appointment and promotion considerations; and the need to assess research on its own merits rather on the journal in which the research is published"". Our message is mainly addressed to the funding agencies and universities that award tenures or grants and manage research programmes, especially in developing countries. The message is also addressed to well-established scientists who have the power to change things when they participate in committees for grants and jobs."
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of walking on incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men with and without chronic disease. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. PARTICIPANTS Japanese-American men aged 71 to 93 at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Physical activity was assessed according to self-reported distance walked per day. Depressive symptoms were measured using an 11-question version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 11) at the fourth examination (n=3,196) and at the seventh examination 8 years later (1999/00, n=1,417). Presence of incident depressive symptoms was defined as a CES-D 11 score of 9 or greater or taking antidepressants at Examination 7. Subjects with prevalent depressive symptoms at baseline were excluded. RESULTS Age-adjusted 8-year incident depressive symptoms were 13.6%, 7.6%, and 8.5% for low (< 0.25 miles/day), intermediate (0.25-1.5 miles/day), and high (> 1.5 miles/day) walking groups at baseline (P=0.008). Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, education, marital status, cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and functional impairment, showed that those in the intermediate and highest walking groups had significantly lower odds of developing 8-year incident depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR)=0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.83, P=.006 and OR=0.61, 95% CI= 0.39-0.97, P=.04, respectively). Analysis found that this association was significant only in participants without chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, Parkinson's disease, dementia, or cognitive impairment) at baseline. CONCLUSION Daily physical activity (>= 0.25 mile/day) is significantly associated with lower risk of 8-year incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men without chronic disease at baseline.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Objective: Previously an experimental computer system was developed to automatically-produce first drafts of genetic counseling patient letters containing biomedical evidence-based arguments. However, letters written by genetic counselors also employ strategies to help clients cope. The objectives of this research were to discover methods for addition of coping-related strategies to the drafts and to explore their efficacy. Methods: Using an argumentation-based approach, the system design was modified to add coping-related strategies used by actual genetic counselors. An evaluation of computer-produced drafts was performed comparing those containing only biomedical arguments to those with coping strategies added to biomedical arguments. Results: The evaluation mainly found no significant impact of adding coping strategies. Conclusion: The main contribution of this work was to show how coping-related strategies can be produced by an artificial intelligence approach within an argumentation-based theoretical framework. A possible future application would be to improve computer-drafted genetic counseling patient letters. Practice implications: Computer-assisted drafting of letters has potential to aid in the practice of genetic counseling. Further research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of adding coping strategies to computer-produced drafts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
International Relations	Rising powers have attracted tremendous interest in international politics and theory. Yet the ways in which secondary powers strategically respond to regional changes in the distribution of power have been largely neglected. This article seeks to fill this gap by presenting a systematic comparative analysis of the different types and causes of contestation strategies undertaken by secondary powers. Empirically, it focuses on two contentious regional dyads in East and South Asia, exploring how structural, behavioral, and historical factors shape the way in which Japan and Pakistan respond, respectively, to China's and India's regional power politics. The article concludes that the explanatory power of these factors depends on the respective secondary power's particular context: in the case of Japan, China's increasingly assertive regional behavior combined with a nontransparent military buildup has invoked the most significant strategic shifts, while in the case of Pakistani contestation, an increasing threat perception in the late 1980s led to the return to a pre-1971 revisionist agenda, whereas the overt nuclearization in the late 1990s mitigated India's growing conventional superiority and enabled Islamabad to replace soft balancing with more direct means of hard balancing.
Geography	In this paper I conceptualise relational ageing in spatial and comparative terms by comparing the life stories and practices of Latvian women who migrated with those who did not. By counterposing the literatures on global care and gender contracts, I make a plea for a time-space attentive geographical approach to ageing migrants, their pre-migration experiences and ongoing relations between migrants and non-migrants. First, I present some lesser-known dynamics of women-to-women (intra-gender) relations in these two groups. Second, I nuance relational effects in contexts when women are ageing but the man is absent from care responsibilities. And third, I focus on cross-generational relations narrated and practised by ageing women abroad and those who stayed in Latvia throughout their lives.
Ethics	"In ""Two-Level Eudaimonism and Second-Personal Reasons,"" Bradford Cokelet argues that we should reject one strategy one I advanced earlier in this journal for reconciling a virtue-ethical theoretical framework with that part of our moral experience that has been described as (among other things) second-personal reasons. Cokelet frames a number of related objections to that strategy, and his concerns are worth taking up. Addressing them provides an opportunity both to revisit and develop the model bruited in my earlier article and to gain additional insight into second-personal reasons and associated relations of accountability."
Substance Abuse	Background and Objectives: This study investigated how negative social interactions (e.g., disagreeing with a friend) predicted subsequent drinking behaviors among Japanese college students. Because of social influences on drinking, and cultural norms for maintaining social harmony and making amends in response to social transgressions in Japanese culture, the authors hypothesized that students would consume more alcohol socially following increases in negative social interactions. Drinking refusal self-efficacy and social self-efficacy were also studied as moderators of social drinking. Methods: Fifty-five college students (79% women) of legal drinking age completed a once-daily Internet survey for 30days, providing 1195 daily reports of drinking and social interaction. Prior to the daily survey, participants reported on Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy and Social Self-Efficacy in an initial Internet-based assessment. Results: Students drank more socially in the evening following daytime increases in negative social interactions, relative to evenings following fewer such exchanges (b = .23, p < .001). At the between-person level, students who reported stronger confidence in refusing to drink drank less socially compared to those who reported less confidence in drinking refusal (b = -.53, p < .001). Yet, those with higher social self-efficacy, which is typically a health-protective factor, drank more socially compared to their counterparts (b = .32, p < .05). Conclusions and Importance: Japanese college students increased their social drinking in response to daily negative social interactions, consistent with the notion that this drinking pattern represents efforts to make amends to others. Interventions targeted toward increasing students' confidence in refusing to drink may be beneficial in reducing social drinking in this population.
Development Studies	A key part of Howard White's work has been getting policymakers and other development decision-makers to use high-quality evidence to make better decisions. This paper reviews the role of evidence in decision-making and some of the key mechanisms by which this can be achieved. It recognises the many factors other than evidence that influence the decision-making process, and some of the barriers that have to be overcome for high-quality evidence to have a contributory role. The importance of identifying and using appropriate intermediaries is recognised, as is the necessity for clear and accessible communication.
Women'S Studies	An important aspect of Johnson's intimate terrorism (IT) and situational couple violence (SCV) typology is his assertion that victims experience different negative outcomes depending on which category of violence they endure. Anderson calls for reexamining this typology to highlight the importance of coercive control with or without physical violence present. Similar to most studies, Anderson's research uses a sample that includes mostly White women. The current study employs Anderson's methods and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses, but uses a sample of predominately Black women and Latinas from the 1998 Chicago Women's Health Risk Study.
Transportation	This paper studies clusters in the logistics sector. Like traditional cluster research, indicators of concentration to detect co-location of employment are calculated. However, this approach is enhanced by including a quantitative analysis of the inter-firm relations between logistics companies through the use of a community detection algorithm on a microeconomic dataset of buyer-supplier relations. Combining both results in a typology of logistics clusters. Next to the big clusters characterized by employment concentration and many internal and external relations, spill-over and polycentric clusters are identified. This approach seems promising to detect in future research clusters in other sectors and places.
Political Science	The role of national parliaments in scrutinising their governments in European Union affairs has been at the forefront of debates on democratic accountability in the European Union for the past two decades. Resolutions are the legislative instruments most clearly associated with government control. This article finds that party political strategies, and especially the different constraints and incentives for mainstream/government parties and issue entrepreneurs on Europe, are the most important factors determining the activity of national parliaments in the form of resolutions on European Union affairs. Issue entrepreneurs are parties which are Eurosceptic and for which Europe is salient. Motions initiated by issue entrepreneurs are numerous but limited to criticising the government and contain little technical detail, while the resolutions of mainstream government parties mostly support the government's position. Resolutions and motions in European Union affairs are thus used rather as instruments of position taking' than as a form of government control, but could still help to foster accountability by bringing European Union issues and government policy to the citizens' attention.
Education, Special	Two multiple-baseline, across-participants design studies were used to examine persuasive quick write (10-minute writing responses) performance of seventh-grade students with disabilities. In the first study, 6 students were taught by a graduate research assistant; in the second study, 10 students were taught by their special education teacher. In both studies, students' written responses were evaluated before, during, and after self-regulated strategy development instruction for the POW + TREE planning strategy (POW: pick my idea, organize my notes, write and say more; TREE: topic sentence, reasons-three or more, explain, ending). All study participants improved in the number of persuasive parts included and the quality of the written response immediately after and weeks following instruction.
International Relations	"The International Relations (IR) profession has not fully taken stock of the way in which user-driven information technologies including Blogger, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia-are reshaping our professional activities, our subject matter, and even the constitutive rules of the discipline itself. In this study, we reflect on the ways in which our own roles and identities as IR scholars have evolved since the advent of ""Web 2.0"": the second revolution in communications technology that redefined the relationship between producers and consumers of online information. We focus on two types of new media particularly relevant to the practice and the profession of IR: blogs and social networking sites."
Nursing	In the current climate of global economic chaos and increasing healthcare litigation, it is perhaps simultaneously unsurprising and yet perplexing that patients continue to fall foul of healthcare systems worldwide. Major incidents in patient care such as serious misdiagnoses, medication errors, the proliferation of superbugs and malpractice persist leading to injury or death of patients, emotional trauma to their families and, understandably, a reduction in the public's confidence in the healthcare system not to mention the financial consequences. Many, if not most or indeed all, of these incidents are preventable and should not happen. Yet the systems in place within healthcare permit their occurrence, with worrying regularity, it would appear. The area that this paper will focus on specifically is that of medication errors. The worrying trends with regard to medication errors will be presented. Potential contributing factors will be examined. The specific aim of this paper is to illuminate the extent and severity of the problem of medication errors in practice and to explore elements within the practice setting that can compound the problem. The multi-faceted nature of the problem will also be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Gerontology	A model community-based outreach program overcomes barriers to screening and case identification of vulnerable older adults in psychiatric distress.
Business, Finance	Using a unique international setting where the effects of disclosure on firm value can be measured in a constant regulatory environment and in isolation of other confounding factors, this paper shows that firms can increase their value through their choice of accounting standards. Specifically, we document strong positive abnormal returns at the announcement of voluntary adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS / IFRS) by a sample of international firms and an economically significant reduction in long-run returns, consistent with a reduction in the cost of capital. Consistent with these results we also document evidence of an upgrade in analyst recommendations after the IAS / IFRS adoption announcement and a reduction in the implied cost of capital. Finally, we find strong evidence that the documented abnormal returns are consistent with signaling and bonding benefits stemming from the reduction in asymmetric information. Our results highlight the importance of increased disclosure on minority shareholder protection and on corporate governance in general.
Substance Abuse	Background: Drinking and smoking commonly co-occur in undergraduate students. Although an identity as a drinker is a known predictor of alcohol use and alcohol problems, and early evidence suggests that it also predicts smoking, the role of these behaviors in the development of an identity as a drinker is unknown. In this study, the authors conceptualized a drinker identity as an enduring memory structure referred to as a self-schema and conducted a preliminary investigation of the relationships between early drinking experiences, drinker self-schema, and alcohol and tobacco use in undergraduate students. Methods: Three-hundred thirty undergraduates who reported current alcohol and tobacco use were recruited for an online survey study. Frequency of alcohol and tobacco use in the past 30days, drinker self-schema, and early experiences with alcohol were measured. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that parental alcohol problems were associated with early onset of drinking. Early onset of drinking and high school friends' drinking were associated with more alcohol use and alcohol-related problems in high school. Alcohol problems during high school were associated with high drinker self-schema scores, which were associated with high frequency of alcohol and tobacco use during college. The indirect effects through the drinker self-schema were significant. Conclusions: Although cross-sectional, this preliminary examination supports theoretical predictions that early alcohol experiences may contribute to development of the drinker self-schema, which, as expected, was positively associated with alcohol and tobacco use in college. Longitudinal studies that track the unfolding of drinking behavior and the contextual factors that are associated with it in the development of the drinker self-schema are essential to confirming the theoretical model. If supported, implications for intervention at different developmental stages to prevent early onset of drinking, limit adolescent alcohol use, and modify the development of a drinker self-schema may mitigate undergraduate drinking and smoking.
Geography	We know from the Grundrisse that Marx felt the division of town and country to be as vital to political economy as the division of classes. From the Manifesto we know that he saw this division as a homological version of the dependency created by capitalism of global South on global North. It was, however, the cultural theorists of twentieth-century Marxism who internalized this geopolitical imagination and significantly developed it in the form of scales and configurations of spatial meaning contained in the concepts city and country. The structuralist revolt against history, then, as a bid to arrest historical becoming, must really be seen as a perverse analogue of earlier twentieth century Marxist innovations in the spatialization of time. Thinkers like Ernst Bloch, Henri Lefebvre, and Raymond Williams, although unheralded for this aspect of their work, developed Marx's nascent city/country pairing, exploring the materiality of its metaphor. In geography, it is Neil Smith's Uneven Development that follows in the footsteps of this classical motif in literary and cultural theory.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: The present study aims at elucidating the impact of stroke on psychosocial functioning of stroke survivors. Methods: Data were investigated using interpretative thematic analysis of illness stories produced by 29 patients. Results: Eight themes emerged from the data: Medical Information; Interpersonal Changes; Cognitive, Physical and Emotional Functioning; Strategies of Coping; Social Support; and Information Irrelevant to the Question. The most frequent organization of the themes followed the course of medical intervention and rehabilitation. Narrations of individual patients varied in terms of the presence of particular themes, the amount of information on each topic and organization. Conclusions: The results suggest that the analysis of non-guided illness narratives can be effectively used to identify the thematic areas important to individual stroke patients. The thematic content analysis of stroke stories can allow health professionals to better understand the patient's state of knowledge related to illness as well as his or her socio-psychological functioning which may be useful in the course of planning further assessment and rehabilitation of patients with stroke.
Geography	This paper explores conservation as an elite process in the Dominican Republic. It begins by showing how conservation at a global level is an elite process, driven by a small powerful elite. Looking at the Dominican Republic, it demonstrates how the extraordinary levels of protection have been achieved by a small network of well connected individuals, who have been able to shape conservation as they like, while limiting the involvement by the large international conservation NGOs who are considered so dominant throughout Latin America. Despite this, conservation both globally and in the Dominican Republic is shown to share similar political structures and the same lack of critique of capitalism or its environmental impacts.
Ethics	Emotions are often portrayed as subjective judgments that pose a threat to rationality and morality, but there is a growing literature across many disciplines that emphasizes the centrality of emotion to moral reasoning. For engineers, however, being rational usually means sequestering emotions that might bias analyses-good reasoning is tied to quantitative data, math, and science. This paper brings a new pedagogical perspective that strengthens the case for incorporating emotions into engineering ethics. Building on the widely established success of active and collaborative learning environments, in particular the problem-based learning (PBL) philosophy and methodology, the paper articulates new strategies for incorporating emotion into engineering ethics education. An ethics education pilot study is analyzed to explore how PBL can engage students' emotions. Evidence suggests that PBL empowers students to cultivate value for engineering ethics and social responsibility, and in doing so, redefine the societal role of the engineer. Taking students' emotions seriously in engineering ethics offers an effective strategy to meaningfully engage students in ethical learning.
Women'S Studies	This study estimates the lifetime prevalence of physical violence during pregnancy and examines risk and protective factors among women (N = 390) attending reproductive health clinics in Jordan. Approximately 15% reported physical violence during pregnancy. The husband was the sole perpetrator in 83% of the cases. A high frequency of quarreling, the husband's use of alcohol, attitudes supportive of a woman's duty to obey her husband, infrequent communication between the respondent and her family, and exposure to violence as a child increased the risk of violence. Consanguinity (marriage to a blood relative) and higher education levels were protective against violence during pregnancy.
Geography	The current global migration regime is extremely complex and characterised by a polarisation of flows. Increasing numbers of individuals fleeing conflict regimes and seeking asylum are faced with restrictive immigration regimes whilst at the same time, highly skilled migrants are welcomed and encouraged to contribute to developed economies. This paper explores the asylum-migration nexus that has emerged as a result of restrictive immigration policy by drawing upon a survey of 300 health professionals in the UK. First, the empirical lens of health professionals fleeing conflict regions is employed to map the contours of the asylum-migration nexus. Second, the implications of highly selective asylum flows to Europe, in terms of economic and social characteristics, are considered. The paper concludes by highlighting concerns that Western refugee policy regimes are worryingly failing to fully meet moral obligations to protect individuals seeking asylum whilst also inadvertently supporting brain drain flows.

Rehabilitation	This review examines some of the critical factors that influenced the evolution of rehabilitation counselor education accreditation. The article discusses the history and structure of the accreditation process and the activities that have occurred to maintain the relevancy and viability of the process. Major issues that the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) has addressed in recent years are highlighted and examples are provided to illustrate the scope and importance of the accreditation process. Commentary is included to help the reader understand the issues that CORE will be addressing and the directions that may become priorities in the future.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	This report traces the progressive expansion of health accounts (HA) to measure national health expenditures, from the first attempts in 1926 by the American Medical Association to the present day. Milestones in the development of A System of Health Accounts (SHA) are covered, from the economic background to initial efforts by a few countries and organizations, to the need for a set of accounting standards for health care systems, and finally, to consolidation with SHA 2011. International organizations, such as the World Health Organization, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Eurostat, the World Bank, and the United States Agency for International Development have been critical to expanding national HA exercises and ensuring that these are standardized, comparable, and become institutionalized. National efforts to track health expenditures have not only enriched collective results, but have become an important component of global leadership, informing policy the world over. More than 100 countries have created HA under the global standard and have gained a better understanding of health spending and financial flows. These results are key for monitoring progress toward national and global initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage. Challenges remain to be tackled, among them institutionalization and quality of results. Social responsibility for improving data sources and expanding the generation and usability of health accounts are also needed.
Education & Educational Research	This article presents innovative analyses on the effects of the age composition of the class using the first wave of a large-scale longitudinal study of nine year old children, the Growing Up in Ireland study. The analyses focus on both academic and social outcomes. Taking account of a rich set of control factors, few overall differences were found in student outcomes between single-grade and multigrade classes. However, girls were found to experience a range of negative effects, depending on the age composition of the class. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Cochrane is an international network that produces and updates new knowledge through systematic reviews for the health sector. Knowledge is a shared resource, and can be viewed as a commons. As Cochrane has been in existence for 25 years, we used Elinor Ostrom's theory of the commons and Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to appraise the organisation. Our aim was to provide insight into one particular knowledge commons, and to reflect on how this analysis may help Cochrane and its funders improve their strategy and development. An assessment of Cochrane product showed extensive production of systematic reviews, although assuring consistent quality of these reviews is an enduring challenge; there is some restriction of access to the reviews, open access is not yet implemented; and, while permanence of the record is an emerging problem, it has not yet been widely discussed. The assessment of the process showed that the resource, community, and rules-in-use are complex, vary between different groups within Cochrane, and are not well understood. Many of the rules have been informal, and the underlying ethos of volunteerism where reviews get done are important features and constraints to the organisation. Like all collective efforts, Cochrane is subject to collective action problems, particularly free-riding and variable commitment, and the under-production of public goods and internal processes, such as surveillance of product quality and procedures for transparent resolution of conflicts.
Political Science	"When a public problem is perceived to be poorly addressed by current policy, it is often the case that credible alternative policies are proposed to both the status quo's left and right. Specially designed national surveys show that in circumstances like these, many Americans' preferences are not single-peaked on the standard left-right dimension. Rather, they simply want the government to ""do something"" about the problem and therefore prefer both liberal and conservative policies to the moderate status quo. This produces individual and collective preferences that are double-peaked with respect to the left-right dimension. Double-peakedness is less prevalent on issues where no consensus exists regarding policy goals, and it increases when exogenous events raise the public's concern about the seriousness of a policy problem."
Communication	"In this article we make an argument for why thinking critically about neoliberalism is important for media and communication studies. We advance a case for a critical media analysis that will take seriously the affective and psychic life of neoliberalism as an increasingly central means of governing and producing people""s desires, attachments, and modes of getting by. To illustrate our broader theoretical argument, we will discuss the contradictory neoliberal regulation of affective dispositions for women, which prescribe confidence or alternatively, the pleasing, lighthearted readiness to not take the self too seriously. We make a case for expanding our theoretical and conceptual vocabulary in order to foreground the relationship between neoliberalism, media and subjectivity in the maintenance of continuing inequalities."
Public Administration	This paper discusses the presence of public policy as a subject of the public administration discipline in Brazil and the USA. The US experience is included due not only to the role the USA played in founding the discipline, but also to the influence it exerted on the establishment of the field of public policy studies in Brazil. Emphasis is given to turning points within public administration discipline, which resulted in the inclusion of public policy as its subject. It also discusses the impact of changes in the political regime on the Brazilian development of the field of public policy.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, the authors analyze changes in wage differentials between white men and women over time and across the entire wage distribution. The authors decompose distributional changes in the gender wage gap to assess the contribution of observed characteristics measuring individual productivity. They find that the gender wage gap narrowed by 16% at the lowest decile and by less than 5% at the highest decile. The decomposition results indicate that changes in the gender wage gap are mainly attributable to changes in educational attainment at the top of the wage distribution, with a sizable part due to work history changes at the bottom. The findings further reveal that the accuracy of the results depends on the direction in which the decompositions are performed.
Women'S Studies	This paper is a tentative attempt to set out some of the basic points for articulating an alternative philosophical praxis derived from some Black women's lives and experiences. It begins with an explanation of delegitimating processes and the importance of not dividing theory from practice. The essay offers six practices that outline the unique critical attitude that constitutes philosophical practices rooted in Black women's lived experience and asks How we sound when doing academic philosophy.
Education, Special	Research into factors underlying the dissemination of evidence-based practice is limited within the field of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). This is pertinent, particularly in the UK where national policies and guidelines do not reflect the emerging ABA evidence base, or policies and practices elsewhere. Theories of evidence-based practice in education and policy suggest that decision makers' 'perceptions' of evidence are significant factors in dissemination. For professionals, scientific evidence is often critical. For others, including parents, experiential and anecdotal evidence can be as important. Within autism education, parents are often, and not necessarily by choice, key decision makers. This study is the first to try to identify and quantify UK parents' beliefs about ABA in the education and support of children with autism. We developed and tested, using an internet survey method, the Parental Beliefs about ABA and Autism scale (P-BAA). Current and/or past use by parents of any behaviorally based approach including ABA was a significant predictor of P-BAA scores as were parent education, household income and child diagnosis: experience of a behaviorally based approach, higher levels of education and income and children at the more 'severe' end of the autism spectrum were associated with more positive beliefs about ABA.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	In innovation policy discourse, clinical practice guidelines are often viewed as gatekeepers: they select which novel technologies may enter clinical practice. Earlier research has pointed out, however, that in biomedical innovation a 'regime of hope' and a 'regime of truth' interact. High expectations of future developments can feed into clinical guidelines by changing assessment criteria, thus co-shaping the 'gate' innovations have to pass. This paper shows how diagnostic guidelines can embody hope in yet another way, by introducing a novel disease vocabulary that paves the way for emerging diagnostic technologies. I discuss two sets of guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: the guidelines issued by the American National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (2011), and the parts of the DSM-5 related to diagnosing AD (2013). Both function as gatekeepers in that they explicitly discourage the use of biomarker testing in clinical practice. However, they also act as 'trailblazers', transforming the conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease in such a way that biomarker tests can be easily fitted in later on. The paper ends with some reflections on the potential presence of such 'trailblazing' in other diagnostic guidelines, and its acceptability from an ethical and societal point of view.
Environmental Studies	Developing an approach to governing adaptation to climate change is severely hampered by the dictatorship of the present when the needs of future generations are inadequately represented in current policy making. We posit this problem as a function of the attributes of adaptation policy making, including deep uncertainty and nonstationarity, where past observations are not reliable predictors of future outcomes. Our research links organizational decision-making attributes with adaptation decision making and identifies cases in which adaptation actions cause spillovers, free riding, and distributional impacts. We develop a governing framework for adaptation that we believe will enable policy, planning, and major long-term development decisions to be made appropriately at all levels of government in the face of the deep uncertainty and nonstationarity caused by climate change. Our framework requires that approval of projects with an expected life span of 30 years or more in the built environment include minimum building standards that integrate forecasted climate change impacts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intermediate scenario. The intermediate IPCC scenario must be downscaled to include local or regional temperature, water availability, sea level rise, susceptibility to forest fires, and human habitation impacts to minimize climate-change risks to the built environment. The minimum standard is systematically updated every six years to facilitate learning by formal and informal organizations. As a minimum standard, the governance framework allows jurisdictions to take stronger actions to increase their climate resilience and thus maintain system flexibility.
Public Administration	Social acceptance has become a key consideration for promoters, government officials and citizens when instituting new energy infrastructures and technologies. Often theorized in normative terms, it is not clear whether and when social acceptance matters. This article explores the rollout of smart meters in Quebec, which proceeded despite significant opposition from municipalities, community groups and unions. Drawing on core concepts from punctuated equilibrium theorypolicy monopoly, policy venue, policy imagewe argue that this opposition had no policy venue to express its grievances. Quebec's electricity sector, with a stable policy environment controlled by a policy monopoly and buttressed by a strong policy image, provided few opportunities to expand the conflict. We conclude from this analysis that public administrators should consider power when measuring social acceptance in political processes.
International Relations	This article posits empirical and political reasons for recent micro-moves' in several contemporary debates, and seeks to further develop them in future International Relations studies. As evidenced by growing trends in studies of practices, emotions and the everyday, there is continuing broad dissatisfaction with grand or structural theory's value without going down' to lower levels' of analysis where structures are enacted and contested. We suggest that empirics of the last 15 years including the war on terror and the Arab Spring have pushed scholars into increasingly micropolitical positions and analytical frameworks. Drawing upon insights from Gilles Deleuze, William Connolly and Henri Lefebvre, among others, we argue that attention to three issues affect, space and time hold promise to further develop micropolitical perspectives on and in International Relations, particularly on issues of power, identity and change. The article offers empirical illustrations of the analytical purchase of these concepts via discussion of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring uprisings.
Rehabilitation	Objective: To estimate the net monetary benefit of an individual placement and support-based supported employment program for Veterans with spinal cord injuries. Design: Economic evaluation comparing a supported employment program to treatment as usual, using cost and quality-of-life data from a longitudinal study of Veterans with spinal cord injuries. Setting: Spinal cord injury centers in the Veterans Health Administration. Participants: Subjects (N = 213) who participated in a 24-month supported employment program at seven spinal cord injury centers. Supported employment participants were compared with a group of spinal cord injury Veterans who received treatment as usual in a prior study. Main outcome measures: Costs and quality-adjusted life years using the Veterans Rand-6 Dimension, estimated from the Veterans Rand 36-Item Health Survey. Results: The supported employment program was more effective at both 1- and 2-year periods compared with treatment as usual. Outpatient costs were significantly higher for supported employment, but inpatient costs were not significantly different from treatment as usual. When cost and effectiveness were compared jointly using net monetary benefit, a supported employment program following the core principles of Individual Placement and Supported employment was more effective but not cost-effective at standard willingness to pay thresholds. When we considered a sub-group of the supported employment participants who more closely resemble the treatment as usual group from a randomized trial, there was no significant difference in the cost-effectiveness of supported employment when compared to treatment as usual. Conclusions: With higher effectiveness and similar costs, supported employment for spinal cord injury Veterans has the potential to be cost-effective. Future studies need to randomize participants or carefully match participants based on observable patient characteristics to improve cost-effectiveness evaluations of this population.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	"The article takes a look at Brazilian Psychiatric Reform over the past decade, after the approval of Federal Law 10.216/2001 and seeks to elicit long overdue discussion about the pressing challenges that Brazilian Psychiatric Reform needs to tackle to promote or review the long-desired utopia of ""full citizenship for all in a society without asylums."" Is the Reform showing signs of exhaustion? The redirection of the care model for Mental Health in Brazil from the hospital to the community over the past decade is an undeniable achievement. Taking the use of psychoactive substances as the scope of policy and intervention, this incorporates complex demands that the current Crack drama makes it more urgent to question its history, its limits, its power. What will keep the flame alight of a successful movement that, surprisingly, has resisted the force of time and stigma in the ten years since the Law was enacted? These and other questions need to be worked on. It is time to recycle the focus of assessment and analysis in order to identify what threatens its vitality. This is the challenge to which the writer and debaters will be enjoined to contribute."
Information Science & Library Science	Introduction. This study explores how personal information management practices could be used to help migrating individuals manage their cultural heritage legacies and to investigate how digital collections of libraries, archives, museums and other information institutions could be utilised by individuals to support further discovery of and learning about their cultural heritages. Method. This paper presents the results of a qualitative research study conducted on a purposive sample of 10 Croatian expatriates living in Europe and on expatriates from various countries living in Croatia. Participants were interviewed about their personal information management practices with a focus on immigration experiences and cultural information needs. Participants used an information source relevant for their personal collections or needs and described their experiences in semi-structured diaries. Results. Migration motivates people to assess the value of personal information and objects and to invest their effort in describing, safeguarding and sharing documents or items with significant value. A stronger motivation exists for using libraries, archives and museum collections when a need arises resulting from a knowledge gap about items in personal collections. Conclusions. Personal information management practices can make a significant difference in managing personal cultural heritage legacy. Collections of information institutions can constitute a part of those practices.
Communication	A within-subjects experiment explored how the number of online, hyperlinked stories available for individuals to choose from affects cognitive processing of a selected story. Participants chose and read unpleasant online news stories from a Web page containing either 5 or 15 headline/photo hyperlinks. Heart rate data indicated more cognitive resources were allocated to reading stories selected from the larger array of hyperlinks. This increased allocation of cognitive resources also led to more accurate story recognition. Results of this study provide insight into information processing of interactive, online news as well as limited suggestions for the design of news Web sites.
Demography	To what extent is there an association between crowding and relationship break-up? And if so, is it a causal relationship? Housing space may affect the probability of separation because of stress, lower subjective well being, and poor mental health, any of which could put pressure on the relationship with the partner and eventually cause a break-up. Using the Luxembourgish PSELL 2003-2011, we operationalize crowding with a subjective measure. We check for the following confounding factors: financial difficulties, home ownership, nationality, and type of household member. We find that there is no significant association between crowding and separation once confounders are taken into account, not to mention causality. Instead, home ownership turns out to be of the utmost importance in explaining the bivariate association between crowding and union dissolution.
Transportation	Research has shown that there are potentially disastrous outcomes of human fatigue at sea. The conditions in which the seafarers have to operate are becoming more and more demanding. The study in this article attempts to aggregate accident charts derived from in-depth studies of human fatigue-related accidents to determine common patterns of interlinked fatigue factors. The accidents are analyzed by means of the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM), which in the article has been modified for maritime accidents. The main fatigue factors identified are 'shift work', 'irregular working hours', 'inadequate task allocation', and 'excessive demands'. The study reveals several differences between ship collision and grounding accidents and their corresponding fatigue factors. Human fatigue-related collision accidents are characterized by wrong/badly timed decisions, misconceptions, and poor communication between the vessels. Right before the collision the crew is often panicking and mistakes are easily made. In human fatigue-related groundings, the conditions are often monotonous and the navigating officer has either overlooked the upcoming seabed or simply fallen asleep. Safety climate issues are also identified as important contributors to human fatigue.
Ethics	The letter is highlighting a case of Business Ethics for Mobile Network Operators based on the recent news.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	This article discusses the poparms command, which implements two semiparametric estimators for multivalued treatment effects discussed in Cattaneo (2010, Journal of Econometrics 155: 138-154). The first is a properly reweighted inverse-probability weighted estimator, and the second is an efficient-influence-function estimator, which can be interpreted as having the double-robust property. Our implementation jointly estimates means and quantiles of the potential-outcome distributions, allowing for multiple, discrete treatment levels. These estimators are then used to estimate a variety of multivalued treatment effects. We discuss pre- and postestimation approaches that can be used in conjunction with our main implementation. We illustrate the program and provide a simulation study assessing the finite-sample performance of the inference procedures.
Education, Special	The most efficacious psychosocial intervention for reducing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in young children is behavioral parent training (BPT). Potential benefits are hindered by limited accessibility, low session attendance, and poor implementation of prescribed strategies. As a result, only approximately half of families with young children with ADHD receive BPT. We describe an innovative approach for reducing barriers to BPT access. Specifically, we invoked an iterative, 5-step process of intervention development and revision to modify an existing face-to-face BPT program and develop an online version. Results indicated that the revised program and online versions (a) increased parent engagement with BPT, (b) enhanced accessibility, (c) produced favorable parent acceptability and feasibility ratings, and (d) resulted in improved child outcomes.
Transportation	One of the most important road safety interventions is the elimination of accident black spots (places with accident density higher than expected). The first step of this process is the identification of these locations. There are several methods for this purpose, but most of them are now outdated. The primary objective of our 5-year project was to adopt data collection and analysis methods according to the related developments of the last decades: (1) the spreading of global positioning system (GPS) technology, (2) the appearance of tablets and smartphones, and (3) the existence of critical amounts of accidental data (enough for data mining approaches). This article presents the final results of our examinations. The authors prepared several methods, regulations, and computer software to integrate these advancements into the daily routine. From the year 2011, Hungarian police officers have used smartphones to record all data about accidents while on the scene, including the GPS coordinates, which leads to more accurate and reliable location information. This allowed the authors to develop a novel black spot-searching algorithm (inspired by some data mining techniques), based on the GPS coordinates of accidents. The authors have implemented it as a web service, and the practical experience shows that it performs very well, especially in built-up areas. Compared to the sliding window method, the site consistency is significantly higher, whereas the method consistency and the rank consistency are quite similar.
Nursing	"Purpose: The purpose of this mixed methods study was to better understand the long term impact of livingrelated liver donation (LRLD) on youth and young adult (YYA) recipients and their family. Design and methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with YYA, aged 11-18 years, who received a living donation from a parent. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed to aggregate themes that represented the participants"" views as live-liver recipients. An ethnographic process was conducted to understand the participants"" social behavior. At interview, participants completed a demographics questionnaire and the Youth Quality of Life Instrument-Research Version (YQOL-R). Results: Thirteen adolescents were interviewed; six were re-interviewed as key informants. Three major categories were created from the data: Developing Identity, Redefining Family Relationships, Feeling Gratitude to Donors. The overarching theme was Resiliency. Findings from the YQOL-R showed no difference in overall scores or separate domains when compared with a reference population with no chronic illness. Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative data highlight the positive effect that LRLD can have on pediatric patients as they transition from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood. Practice implications: As pediatric trans plant centers in the United States soon mark 30 years of performing live-liver donation, recipients are becoming adults and understanding more clearly that the long-term effects of such donations will lead to improvements in future care.

Economics	This article employs a variety of econometric models (including OLS, VEC/VAR, DCC GARCH and a class of copula-based GARCH models) to estimate optimal hedge ratios for gasoline spot prices using gasoline exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gasoline futures contracts. We then compare their performance using four different measures from the perspective of both their hedging objectives and trading position using four different measures: variance reduction measure, utility-based measure and two tail-based measures (value at risk and expected shortfall). The impact of the 2008 financial market crisis on hedging performance is also investigated. Our findings indicate that, in terms of variance reduction, the static models (OLS and VEC/VAR) are found to be the best hedging strategies. However, more sophisticated time-varying hedging strategies could outperform the static hedging models when the other measures are used. In addition, ETF hedging is a more effective hedging strategy than futures hedging during the high-volatility (crisis) period, but this is not always the case during the normal time (post-crisis) period.
Education & Educational Research	Multiple international studies have confirmed the positive impact of library services and teacher-librarian partnerships on delivering curriculum outcomes and quality student learning in secondary schools. Despite this, there are indications internationally that school libraries are in decline. This article uses qualitative data from a national survey of teachers and librarians in New Zealand secondary schools to investigate teacher and librarian attitudes and beliefs about the role of library services as a space to help develop The New Zealand Curriculum's (Ministry of Education, 2007) (NZC) future-focused vision of knowledgeable, critically and creatively engaged citizens, and the teaching of its attendant competencies. Our findings suggest that teachers' and librarians' beliefs and attitudes towards the library and to each other differ significantly, leading to an underutilisation of library services as a central resource for effective curriculum implementation. We conclude by arguing for a systemic revision of how libraries are positioned, staffed, and resourced in schools, that will change teacher and management beliefs to more closely align with the espoused pedagogical position of NZC and, ultimately, and most importantly, to engender sustained gains in student learning.
Development Studies	Despite broad international agreement on the importance of addressing global health inequalities on grounds of both social justice and health security, there is little accord on how this should be done. The Debate that follows interrogates the role that capital and corporate institutions have assumed in defining and implementing global healthcare reforms. The contributors to the Debate do not agree on the legitimacy of the classic oppositions in design of healthcare state vs market or public vs private. Nor do they concur on the (in)compatibility between pragmatic collaboration with corporate institutions and realization of norms of social justice in health. Yet all do agree that unequal access to healthcare is only one of the structural determinants of inequalities in global health. Global capital is implicated in structural patterns of investment that have made jobs, wages and land-based livelihoods insecure and unhealthy, fouled air and water and profited from spiralling costs of drugs and treatment. On such an economically and politically conflictual terrain, it is unlikely that collaboration with corporate institutions is consistent with structural assault on the social determinants of global inequalities in health.
Political Science	This article examines the relationship between religiosity and support for democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Using data from the last World Values Survey, we examine levels of religiosity among Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, and their support for democracy. The influence of religiosity on support for democracy is also explored. The results indicate that religiosity has a negative influence on support for democracy, and it is particularly true for individuals who do not support the separation of the religious from the political sphere and who exhibit lower support for democracy. The article also examines different levels of religiosity among the three groups, controlling for a wide range of variables. We conclude that there is basically no difference in support for democracy between Croats and Bosniaks, while Serbs exhibit somewhat lesser support for democracy than members of the other two ethnic groups. Serbs also seem to be somewhat less religious than Bosniaks and Croats. Opposition to separation of the religious from the political sphere is a major source of lack of support for democracy among Croats and Bosniaks, but not among Serbs.
Urban Studies	Since the late 1990s, Chinese cities have been experiencing significant suburbanization with massive numbers of people moving out of city centers. Facing this background, this paper aims to identify the typology of residential resettlements in suburban areas, and analyze the mechanisms of each residential resettlement via archive studies, census tracks and field research instead of the traditional macro-demographic approach. Five types of resettlement are identified, comprising public housing districts for poor people with housing difficulties, low-end private housing districts for lower socio-economic people, multiple housing districts (containing public housing and low-end private housing) for displaced shantytown residents, and villa areas for the wealthy. This suburban residential resettlement pattern is generally different from that in Western cities, which is largely attributed to the Chinese governments' monopoly of land supply and public service provision. It is also concluded that the state power, capitalist actors (e.g., developers and private enterprises), and other professionals (e.g., planners and architects) have become the Chinese characterized 'pushing' factors and actors in driving the typology of suburban resettlement housing in the context of urbanization era of China. Besides, the five typology of resettlement housing has brought about socio-spatial consequences including a spatial mismatch for lower socioeconomic groups in suburban areas, which may lead to the formation of poverty belts around Chinese cities. This may provide important implication for understanding the residential resettlement in other developing countries with similar context.
Transportation	This article proposes an integrated container management model to jointly optimize slot allocation plan for loaded containers and reposition for empty containers in a shipping network. The proposed model employs linear programming to formulate loaded and empty container shipping problems in a bi-level structure. In upper level the loaded container slot allocation plan aims to maximize operational profits for each service route; whereas in lower level the reposition of empty containers aims to minimize transportation costs for the entire shipping network. The surplus or deficient empty containers resulted from the upper problem are fed into the lower problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a real case of an intra-Asian short-sea container carrier is presented. The results show that the proposed model can serve as a decision support tool to facilitate the liner to ship the loaded and empty containers in a coordinative way.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This study investigated which intention-based model, namely: (1) the technology acceptance model (TAM; Model 1); (2) the theory of planned behavior (TPB: Model 2); and (3) the decomposed TPB (DTPB; Model 3) is best for predicting and explaining employees' behavioral intention to use hotel information system (HIS). Data were obtained from employees of 13 upscale hotels in jeju, South Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine and compare the three competing theoretical models (CTMs) in terms of overall model fit, explanatory power, and paths significance. The findings of this study revealed that if the key objective is to predict behavioral intention to use HIS, the TAM is preferable. However, if the key objective is to explain behavioral intention to use HIS, the DTPB is preferable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Gerontology	Many couples want to retire together even if spouses differ in age. Drawing on theories of leisure complementarity, gender roles and social status, this article uses comprehensive Swedish register data from 2002 to 2010 to explore synchronised retirement and its association with spousal age differences and other socio-demographic factors. Synchronisation rates in dual-earner couples (N = 83,986) were 10 per cent for retirement the same calendar year and 25 per cent for retirement the same or the following year. Contrary to theoretical expectations, synchronisation was more common in women-older couples than in men-older couples, although this was largely a consequence of the skewed distribution of age differences. Moreover, spouses' education, incomes, assets, employment and health were differently associated with synchronisation in same-age, men-older and women-older couples. In the total population, average retirement age differed very little between synchronising couples and other couples. Yet women who synchronised retired at an earlier age than other women, whereas men who synchronised retired later than other men. This was partly an effect of the predominance of men-older couples, but men in men-older couples were also more likely than women in women-older couples to delay retirement in order to synchronise.
Information Science & Library Science	A differential in the competitiveness of an organization is its ability to improve the use of knowledge, which sometimes is restricted to certain people or departments of organizations. The dissemination of knowledge and the need to learn continuously proving to be indispensable requirements in the current context, characterized by the increasing flow of information and skills required for the job. To disseminate information, learning and sharing process is essential. In that sense, the present study aims at verifying how such process occurs in a traditional food agribusiness established in Areia - PB. In methodological terms, the research is characterized as case study, of qualitative approach. The collection of data was accomplished by interviews with semi-structured survey based on Tonet and Paz (2006) sharing model and the results interpretation was based on a content analysis, besides the non participative observation, with the intention of capturing information, not revealed during the interviews. The results indicated that in the studied industry the main problems are in the initial phase of the sharing process, for there is not a formal and organized way to share experiences and information besides the lack of a favorable culture for knowledge sharing.
Area Studies	The purpose of this article is threefold: to identify opportunities and constraints for migrants in participating in their host society; to further explore variance in formal political participation; and to assess how different citizenship policies give rise to different types of participation and different targets for claims-making. The article first discusses how different understandings of citizenship and implementations of citizenship policy give rise to a different set of opportunities for migrants to participate in the political sphere. This is exemplified with reference to Turkish organizations in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The paths these states have chosen in terms of integration and citizenship policies have resulted in a different set of opportunities for Turks' formal participation.
Transportation	"Port devolution and port governance are focal issues in port studies. This paper argues that the previous typology of port devolution and port governance, including port function matrix models, might have to be modified, in particular for Asian port cases, because they have not considered socio, economic, and political systems and historical aspects behind the port devolution continuum. This paper uses the ""compound eyes"" approach comprising of many similar, closely-packed facets called ommatidia, with a multiple angle view, to revisit and review previous port devolution and governance models. The paper aims to identify the limitations and rectify fallacies in previous port studies by conducting a critical review and taking a couple of Asian container port cases as examples. This paper contributes to the literature of port devolution and governance, illuminating crucial gaps that the previous studies have not addressed."
Business, Finance	European companies were confronted with new organisational challenges when the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was introduced in 2005. What were their cognitive sources for developing ail orientation in this scheme? This paper presents original data from a survey of the University of Hamburg, dealing with companies' responses to the EU ETS in 2005-2007. The survey was conducted three times and addressed all companies covered by the trading scheme in Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands (response rate of 19%-23% over three years). Results are provided oil the share of companies that traded emission allowances, oil the knowledge of their own CO(2) abatement costs, oil the organisational unit that was responsible for decisions oil emissions trading, and oil the use of internal and external sources of advice. The data thus provides ail insight into the cognitive resources that companies brought to bear when looking for ail orientation in the new trading scheme. The sources of advice and the internal assignment of responsibility build the framework of competencies in which companies learn to account for carbon. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Economics	We examine the relationship between proficiency in Mandarin and consumption in China. We find that proficiency in Mandarin has a positive effect on an individual's total consumption expenditure as well as most categories of consumption expenditure. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the effects of Mandarin proficiency on consumption across subsamples. In addition, we find that proficiency in Mandarin has a positive effect on relative consumption, irrespective of the manner in which the reference group is defined. Our results have important policy implications for debates on the promotion of a national language and, in particular, recent debate about the promotion of speaking Mandarin in China.

Education, Special	The present study investigated the reasons of parents request for the initial evaluation to determine their children's special educational needs (SEN) and the state authorities' response in the Greek educational system. For the needs of the present study, 250 case files were randomly selected from a state Centre for Differential Diagnosis and Support, which is responsible for the identification, evaluation and intervention for students with SEN. Various data were recorded, such as parental reason for requesting the evaluation, the official designation for each case, whether the parent accepted the evaluation results and whether any individualised intervention plan or other recommendations were specified. The analysis suggested that most cases involved students with learning disabilities, although a certain degree of disagreement in the classification of students was observed. For the majority of cases, parents accepted the official diagnosis; however, the state centre did not offer an intervention plan to benefit the students in the majority of the cases. Implications based on the present study findings are considered.
Law	Deregulation has played both the hero and the villain in recent years. This Article evaluates the impact of deregulation on what may be the single most economically important regulatory regime: the income tax. In order to accomplish this goal, it applies the concepts of fiscal arbitrage and compliance spirals to three deregulatory tax reforms. Compliance spirals describe an enforcement dynamic in which the regulator encourages compliance through a system of rewards for cooperation and punishment for noncooperation. Fiscal arbitrage describes policy measures that exploit cognitive biases and other anomalies to deliver political benefits by using minimal political capital. The combination of these two concepts creates a tool for tax authorities to evaluate deregulatory tax provisions for likely costs and benefits. On balance, this Article finds that tax deregulation is likely to be harmful.
Industrial Relations & Labor	In a representative sample of 13,683 U.S. employees, we compared survivors of layoffs, offshoring, outsourcing, and their combinations to a group who experienced no downsizing. Survivors of layoffs perceived lower organizational performance, job security, affective attachment, calculative attachment, and had higher turnover intentions. Offshoring survivors perceived lower performance, fairness, and affective attachment, but outsourcing survivors generally did not have more negative outcomes than the no-downsizing group. Layoffs generally had more negative outcomes than other downsizing forms.
Ethics	One of the most interesting features of the computer is its ability to create virtual environments. These environments allow us to interact with objects that are simulated by the computer and are not real. They thus allow us to realize actions that have no repercussions whatsoever on the non-virtual world. This seems to qualify virtual environments as an ideal playground to do all kinds of things that would be labelled ethically wrong if realized in the real world. Nevertheless, we have the feeling that certain types of virtual actions raping computer simulated girls for example are not right at all, in spite of the fact that we know that no actual person is harmed by this. In the light of phenomena like virtual rape and violence, philosophical reflection on the ethical status of actions realized in virtual worlds has become inevitable. This paper will provide the groundwork for such a reflection, by answering the following questions: Can we apply the predicates of 'right' and 'wrong' to actions realized in virtual worlds? And if this turns out to be problematic, how can we explain our feeling of discomfort with certain types of virtual behaviour, i.e. our feeling that there is something 'not at all right' about, for example, virtual rape? These questions will be answered in the three sections of this paper. The first section deals with the necessary condition for the application of the predicates of 'right' and 'wrong' to virtual actions: freedom in the virtual environment. In the second section, we will endeavour to demonstrate that the fulfilment of this necessary condition is not sufficient when it comes to the application of these predicates to virtual actions. The last section explains how we can still be uncomfortable with certain virtual actions, even though the said actions escape ethical judgment.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The Crescent Ranking (CR) is a service benefiting both the supply-side (halal-friendly hotels) and the demand-side (Muslims wanting to have a guest experience consistent with their way of living) within the tourism market. Halal is a technical term in the Arabic language usually translated as permissible from the perspective of Islamic law (sharia'ah). This study examines the transparency of the top and bottom 10 hotels listed on the CR site. First, we compared the hotel profile as per the CR listing with the hotel's own website. Next, we examined guest reviews on a word-of-mouth proxy site (), paying particular attention to the feedback of non-Muslim guests. Following this analysis, self-styled Islamic hotel managers were interviewed to triangulate the data. We found Islamic hotels to be intransparent to their guests seeking an Islamically compliant holiday and also to those seeking a conventional hotel experience. We suggest several reasons hotels misrepresent themselvesself-orientalization, a necessity to present nice Islam, an ethics gap, and/or a poor understanding of marketing and market positioning. We consider regulation of the Islamic hotel industry to be a mechanism policy makers, and managers could, adopt to become transparent and to protect demand-side (guests) rights. Regulation would also differentiate hotels operating an Islamic business model and those merely offering a few simple services appreciated by Muslim travellers.
Political Science	The state of American federalism in 2014-2015 is characterized by inertia and centrifugal force. Party polarization and divided government exacerbate gridlock at the federal level as President Obama faces Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Policy activity has shifted outward to state legislatures and citizens, the federal and state executive branches, and the court system, creating a diverse set of alternative institutional pathways and outcomes. Some policies, like Medicaid and K-12 education, are largely shaped by federal-state executive branch negotiations, leading to individualized state programs. Other policies-such as marijuana, gun, and immigration laws-are made by state legislatures or citizens acting through the initiative process. Meanwhile, a series of court decisions has doubled the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal. In the current political context, American federalism is characterized by a substantial dispersion of power and a variety of pathways to policy-making.
Social Work	This article addresses the questions of why to include and how to approach LGBT issues in the context of European social work education. Referring to social work's commitment to LGBT people, the article points out its ongoing relevance as questions of marginalisation and discrimination point far beyond formal equality in legislation and normalisation of homosexuality within existing societal institutions. Furthermore, new questions and dynamics in rapidly changing and highly diverse societal contexts bring about new challenges in addressing LGBT issues. Against this background, the article discusses problems of representation and knowledge and underlines the potential of a queer approach. A queer perspective questions taken-for-granted assumptions about sexual orientation, gender identity and intimate relationships. It challenges normalising categories of sex, gender and desire and brings out possibilities existing beyond the heteronormative order. This way, it offers social work education a powerful theoretical lens to address issues on sexual orientation and gender identity not only as yet another minority issue, but as transversal matter and as good news for all. In this article, we use the acronym LGBT to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. LGBT is meant to include and at the same time emphasise the differences between people who do not (exclusively) define themselves as heterosexual and who cannot or do not want to match or identify with binarities of sex, gender and desire. We do not use the acronym LGBTI because we find it problematic to include intersex people without taking explicitly into account their specific situations and needs. Making a plea for a queer approach, we share - of course - a critical view on categorisations and identity labels.
Social Work	This study examined the predictive effects of attitude toward aging on mental health of aging Chinese. Data were obtained from community surveys utilizing mixed sampling methods of 4,240 elderly Chinese 55 years or older in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used, with sociodemographic variables entered first, followed by the health variables, and then attitude toward aging. The effect of attitude toward aging on mental health was stronger than most other predictive factors. Social workers should focus on creating social/community environments that build a positive attitude toward aging.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The prospect of lab-grown meat has attracted a lot of attention. The peak of this attention occurred after the public tasting of the first 'lab-grown burger' in August 2013. However, the discourse surrounding lab-grown meat is limited, and largely shaped by the technology's proponents. This limited narrative restricts the potential for public discussions and debates about the details of lab-grown meat's development. Such restrictions clash with lab-grown meat proponents' stated goal of openness and complicate some of their ethical claims. To begin to overcome these restrictions, this paper introduces contamination as a method that brings important excluded elements to bear on narratives of technological development, particularly those that emphasize biological immanence and plasticity. Reading proponent's narrative alongside related discourses - the industrialization of agriculture, the biomedical history of cell culture, and the work of bioartists and science fiction writers - reveals systematically excluded contaminants that could threaten the technology's viability. The nature of these contaminants is both material (e.g., microorganisms, fetal bovine serum) and semiotic (e.g., associations with factory farming and fictional dystopias), revealing the usefulness of contamination as a tactic that both encourages paying attention to the ways in which discourse and matter coshape each other and broadens the scope of consideration and discussion around technological development.
Nursing	Purpose: The present study aimed to highlight the feeding challenges of infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) that caregivers encounter and analyze the alternative interventions they perform based on their experiences in the preoperative period. Design and methods: Parents of 200 infants with CLP were asked to complete our questionnaire. The prenatal feeding preparations, preoperative processes, and feeding challenges and modifications to overcome these difficulties were evaluated. Results: One-third of the caregivers stated that they had received feeding education prenatally. Sixty-five percent of the parents stated that they were not successful in breastfeeding. Infants with isolated cleft lip had minor feeding difficulties, whereas the ones with cleft palate had some major challenges such as aspiration, choking, and inadequate growth. Parents also reported that 59.5% of the infants with cleft had stayed in the intensive care units following birth. Moreover, 42% of the infants were initially fed by nasogastric or orogastric tube. Out of the 166 infants with cleft palate, 31.9% used palatal obturators. Conclusions: We have reviewed the various feeding difficulties of the infants with clefts and highlighted the results of the interventions performed to overcome these difficulties for better nutrition and growth.

Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	I present a new command, kcdf, for bandwidth selection in kernel estimation of the cumulative distribution function. I briefly review plug-in and cross-validation bandwidth selectors, both of which are implemented in kcdf. I then describe the command syntax and illustrate its use with an application to artificial data.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article examines how a particular class of material objects-antidepressants-circulate in women's social, cultural and intimate lifeworlds. Following the action of antidepressants in their encounters with bodies and brains by way of the agencies they express and the specific work they perform reveals much of the social, affective and material gendering of depression, along with the everyday activities by which this gendering is resisted. Drawing on data from a qualitative research project, we examine how women conceptualise their brains as needing 'work' through antidepressants, and then consider the particular kinds of 'work' that these objects perform. In instances where they refuse antidepressant medication, women co-constitute antidepressants as objects to be resisted and objects that resist, reframing in the process relationships between corporeality, diagnosis and pharmaceutical matter. The 'female' brain emerges in our study as a potent site for the gendering of depression as antidepressants become entangled in the social, material and affective dynamics of women's everyday lives.
History Of Social Sciences	The Ayalon route is an infrastructural corridor serving as the principal northern and southern entrance to the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, bundling together multi-lane expressway, railway tracks, and a flood regulation canal. Its planning history, changing from a meandering seasonal river to Israel busiest traffic route, was a lengthy and incremental process, generating several plans by different planning agencies with different ambitions. Since the inception of the idea to implement a highway on what was described as 'natural opening' - the beds of the Ayalon (Musrara) river, this area became a landscape of opportunity, inciting social imagination among urban planners, municipal and national officials who used the road as an organizing device for the development of the city and the nation. This historical research explores the co-production of urban planning and transportation planning, not as rivalling forces but as coproducing processes.
Linguistics	Why do nominalizations mean what they do? I investigate two deverbal nominalizers in Northern Paiute (Uto-Aztecan, Numic: Western United States), -na and -di, which create nominalizations that describe either an event (like the Poss-ing gerund in English) or an individual (like agent nominalizations with -er). I propose a syntax and semantics for these deverbal nominalizations that account for their interpretive variability. On the syntax side, I argue that -na and -di overtly realize the nominal functional head that canonically assigns case to possessors when this head takes a vP complement. On the semantics side, I propose that Northern Paiute has operators that abstract over a variable inside nominalizations. This accounts for the meanings that deverbal nominalizations in Northern Paiute have, and it highlights their relationship to nominalization patterns in other languages.*
International Relations	This article suggests that there exists an alternative form of international political behavior between countries who share a common traumatic past: diplomacy with memory. Diplomacy with memory manifests itself as an official, diplomatic team performance that aims at conveying a certain historic image for the purpose of achieving rational aims on the international stage. In a first step, a theoretical and empirical framework is developed that highlights diplomacy with memory as a strategic diplomatic action that does not conform with mainstream IR models of state behavior. In a second step, the new theoretical model is tested on two selected post-conflict scenarios: The bilateral negotiations between West Germany and Israel, and between Austria and Israel about eventual reparation payments to the Jewish state in the early 1950s. Extracting the core elements of the diplomacy with memory from these historical examples, this paper suggests amending the toolkit of traditional diplomatic strategies with memory in order to better explain state behavior in other postconflict situations as they emerge.
Family Studies	This article reports findings from an interpretive study of filial responsibility constructions among 28 adult children with ageing parents in Victoria, Canada. Participants were interviewed in person and data were analysed using coding and constant comparison, with attention to the content and process of talk. Participants tended to have difficulty with using the construct of responsibility to describe the support they provided for ageing parents. Ambivalence was tied to symbolic associations of the construct with obligation and burden, which were difficult to reconcile with interpretations of filial relationships as loving and moral, and participants' desires to construct themselves as autonomous. Participants also sought to interpret parent support as voluntary, yet the ideal of choice was difficult to reconcile with specific realities. The discussion highlights how the interpretive framework of choice may further inadvertently support political and economic goals that promote and increase the need for family care of older people.
Economics	Economic instability has risen in emerging economies after capital account liberalization. A more progressive income tax policy could offer a stabilizing alternative. It could result in more revenue, more countercyclical policy, and more income equality and thus more stable demand growth. We test the effects of progressive taxes on stability using univariate and multivariate analyses based on panel data for emerging economies from 1982 to 2002 and compare those to the effects of a value added tax (VAT). We also consider possible constraints on tax policy design, such as government spending, international tax competition, and openness. Progressive taxes are associated with greater income equality and a higher likelihood of countercyclical fiscal policies. The potential benefits from progressive income taxation, though, are lower with VAT. Tax policy is also constrained by government expenditures and openness, but not by lower corporate taxes, suggesting that all income tax rates are constrained by openness.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Minimum wages legislation in the United Kingdom applies to those aged 16years or older. Evidence is presented that children believe that their wage levels should be fair'. On one hand, such views have emerged from focus groups of working children. On the other, various pressure groups representing young people are seeking to establish fair payment to child workers. It is argued that the government, trade unions and other bodies have failed to adequately address the protection of young workers.
Communication	Four editing variables were tracked through a content analysis of U.S. commercial network editing that spanned a 36-year period. The analysis revealed that synthetic-montage increased and continuity-realism decreased from 1969 through 1997. Network news editors also embraced faster pacing, shorter soundbites, and more special effects between 1969 and 2005. When taken together, the results suggest that U.S. network television journalism has evolved from more ocamera of recordo and realistic news techniques in favor of a variety of synthetic editing strategies that convey complex audio-visual arguments.
Urban Studies	This article characterizes and evaluates a paradigm case of urban collaborative governance: the so-called Nantes model. Stressing its positioning in the particular tradition of French politics and drawing on poststructuralist discourse theory, this article demonstrates how the myth of the jeu a la Nantaise (the Nantes game) informs a discourse of urban collaborative governance with a distinctive triad of policy goals. In the context of fiscal tightening and multiple crises, this governance practice involves various strategies designed to incorporate neighborhoods and communities in the co-production of public policies in a pragmatic way. Analyzing the grammar and forms of these practices reveals that co-governance in Nantes functions as a doctrinal abridgement, leading to a growing managerialization in an increasingly codified system of community participation. We thus conclude that one line of flight in the Nantes model signifies a movement away from an image of collaborative pragmatism as a complex praxis of governing to an ideology that conceals the complications and messiness of governing in a collaborative manner.
Information Science & Library Science	In many important application domains, such as text categorization, scene classification, biomolecular analysis and medical diagnosis, examples are naturally associated with more than one class label, giving rise to multi-label classification problems. This fact has led, in recent years, to a substantial amount of research in multi-label classification. In order to evaluate and compare multi-label classifiers, researchers have adapted evaluation measures from the single-label paradigm, like Precision and Recall; and also have developed many different measures specifically for the multi-label paradigm, like Hamming Loss and Subset Accuracy. However, these evaluation measures have been used arbitrarily in multi-label classification experiments, without an objective analysis of correlation or bias. This can lead to misleading conclusions, as the experimental results may appear to favor a specific behavior depending on the subset of measures chosen. Also, as different papers in the area currently employ distinct subsets of measures, it is difficult to compare results across papers. In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of multi label evaluation measures, and we give concrete suggestions for researchers to make an informed decision when choosing evaluation measures for multi-label classification.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES To assess the associations of long-term lifestyle multidomain intervention (MI) and omega-3 supplementation with frailty level evolution and frailty incidence in community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial. SETTING Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1588 community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or older with memory complaints (without dementia), slow gait speed, or limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living. INTERVENTION A 3-year MI (43 group sessions including cognitive training, physical activity, and nutrition advice and three preventive consultations) plus daily omega-3 fatty acids, MI plus placebo, omega-3 alone, or placebo alone. MEASUREMENTS The frailty phenotype (unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait, low handgrip strength: 0 to 5 score, higher is worse; a score of 3 or higher defines frailty) was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. We used mixed-effect models for frailty level (0-5 score as an ordinal variable) and Cox models for frailty incidence. RESULTS No differences were found between the intervention groups and placebo on the 3-year evolution of frailty level. Among 1394 non-frail participants at baseline, frailty incidence occurred in 134 (9.6%) persons: 26 (7.6%) in the MI plus omega-3 group, 34 (10%) in the omega-3 alone group, 31 (8.5%) in the MI plus placebo group, and 43 (12.3%) in the placebo-alone group). No differences regarding frailty incidence were found between intervention groups and placebo. After exclusion of 53 participants with incident frailty during the first year of follow-up, MI plus omega-3 was associated with a lower frailty incidence compared with placebo (hazard ratio = .43; 95% confidence interval = .22-.81). CONCLUSION In community-dwelling older persons, the combination of a long-term lifestyle MI and omega-3 supplementation did not reduce frailty level or incidence. The reduction of frailty incidence associated with the combined intervention in a sensitivity analysis needs to be further confirmed. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1700-1706, 2019
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	With the market competition of hotel industry being heated, it is critical that hotels have a breadth of resource and more flexible forms to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. In the past, the relation of total quality management (FQM), market orientation, and performance are equivocal. These mixed results may be due to some factors or not to include the environmental factors. This study adopts the Input-Processing-Output (IPO) concept model to construct all variables research model. The research surveyed samples of 588 and used Structural Equation Model and discriminate analysis for analysis and testing. The results show that TQM positively affects hotel performance. Market orientation positively affects hotel performance. Market orientation has the mediating effect between TQM and hotel performance. External environment factors truly play a moderator between TQM, market orientation and hotel performance, especially when external environment factors greater changes are going to help to build relationship with customer, to enhance hotel performance and further to gain chance of hotel's survival.

Development Studies	This paper examines the interactive effect of financial development and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows on domestic investment in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). A panel data of 16 SSA countries sampled from 1980 to 2014 are employed. Using the fixed effect, pooled OLS and the FMOLS techniques, our empirical results show that financial development complements FDI inflows to augment domestic investment in SSA. Among other things, the direct effect of FDI inflows, financial sector development, real GDP growth, domestic savings and trade openness are investment promoting while lending rate and inflation inhibit domestic investment in the region. As a policy implication, deepening the financial sector demands considerable attention since it serves as an important channel through which FDI influences domestic investment. While developing the financial sector, it is equally essential that policymakers give enough attention to key macroeconomic stability.
International Relations	We examine whether refugee flows increase transnational terrorism in states to which refugees flee. Recent studies find that refugee flows contribute to the spread of interstate and civil war, but to a far lesser extent have studies examined how refugee flows could lead to other forms of political violence. We discuss two ways in which refugee flows can lead to transnational terrorism: how conditions in camps contribute to the radicalization of refugees; and how poorly host states treat refugees. We then conduct empirical tests using data on worldwide international refugee flows and transnational terrorism. Specifically, we model the effect of refugee flows on transnational terror attacks within a directed dyad framework to account for characteristics of origin and host states. Using a rare-events logit model, along with count models to check robustness, we find that refugee flows significantly increase the likelihood and counts of transnational terrorist attacks that occur in the host country, even when controlling for other variables. Given the prominence of refugee flows and populations worldwide, the results suggest that states with significant refugee populations and the international community at large should take measures to address the conditions in refugee camps, as well as the treatment of refugees by host states in order to prevent transnational terrorism.
Business, Finance	We calculate composite indices to compare the attractiveness of 27 European countries for institutional investments into the Venture Capital and Private Equity asset class. To achieve this we use 42 different parameters, and propose an aggregation structure that allows for benchmarking on more granulated levels. The United Kingdom leads our ranking, followed by Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. While Germany is slightly above the average European attractiveness level, the scores are rather disappointing for France, Italy, Spain, and Greece. Our analyses reveal that while the UK is similar to the other European countries with respect to many criteria, there are two major differences, which ultimately affect its attractiveness: its investor protection and corporate governance rules, and the size and liquidity of its capital market. The state of the capital market is likewise a proxy for the professionalism of the financial community, for deal flow and exit opportunities. We determine a reasonable correlation between our attractiveness index scores and actual Venture Capital and Private Equity fundraising activities and prove the robustness of our calculations. Our findings across all the European countries suggest that, while investor protection and capital markets are in fact very important determinants for attractiveness, there are numerous other criteria to consider.

Public Administration	There is some tendency to lump together policy failures arising from different sources and having different fundamental characteristics. This is a problem conceptually, as well as for building effective theory about policy failure, but it can also be a practical difficulty for policymakers if they fail to differentiate these various possible roots of failure. This paper explores the linkages among these types of failure within the public sector.
Economics	This paper presents a model to determine the tax effort and tax capacity of 96 countries and the main variables from which they depend. The results and the model allow us to clearly determine which countries are near their tax capacity and which are some way from it, and therefore, could increase their tax revenue. Our study corroborates previous analysis inasmuch as the positive and significant relationship between tax revenue as percent of GDP and the level of development (per capita GDP), trade (imports and exports as percent of GDP) and education (public expenditure on education as percent of GDP). The study also demonstrates the negative relationship between tax revenue and inflation (CPI), income distribution (GINI coefficient), the ease of tax collection (agricultural sector value added as GDP percent), and corruption.
International Relations	There is a widespread perception that power is shifting in global politics and that emerging powers are assuming a more prominent, active and important role. This article examines the role of emerging powers such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa (BASIC) in climate change politics and the extent to which their rise makes the already difficult problem of climate change still more intractabledue to their rapid economic development, growing power-political ambitions, rising greenhouse gas emissions and apparent unwillingness to accept global environmental responsibility. By reviewing the developments in global climate politics between the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and Rio+20, this article unsettles the image of a clear shift in power, stressing instead the complexity of the changes that have taken place at the level of international bargaining as well as at the domestic and transnational levels. Within this picture, it is important not to overestimate the shifts in power that have taken place, or to underplay the continued relevance of understanding climate change within the NorthSouth frame. Emerging powers will certainly remain at the top table of climate change negotiations, but their capacity actively to shape the agenda has been limited and has, in some respects, declined. Even though emerging powers have initiated and offered greater action on climate change, both internationally and domestically, they have been unable to compel the industrialized world to take more serious action on this issue, or to stop them from unpicking several of the key elements and understandings of the original Rio deal. At the same time, developing world coalitions on climate change have also fragmented, raising questions about the continued potency of the global South in future climate politics.
Sociology	This paper is aimed to analyse the development of indicators for youth and young adults social exclusion and living conditions. The first part of the paper presents analysis of social exclusion and to this issue related concepts: social deprivation, poverty etc. The main characteristics of youth and young adults as a social exclusion group were discussed. The second part of the paper is devoted to the methodological questions of social exclusion (measurement and indicators). The third part of the paper presents original monitoring methodology and indicators of youth and young adults social exclusion and living conditions. These indicators could be successfully applied for scientific and public administration purposes. The following dimensions of youth and young adults social exclusion and living conditions were identified: employment, income, education, health status, accessability to social services, housing, social relationships, deviance / anomy, migration I regional differencies, civic, political participation and sociodemographic indicators. Macro-level indicators were oriented towards indicators that are collected by the Lithuanian and EU statistical offices and departments. Micro-level indicators were based on subjective attitudes of respondents / informants.
Area Studies	The conventional wisdom asserts that anti-Americanism in Turkey started as a result of the Cyprus Crisis in 1964. Yet the roots of anti-Americanism can be traced back to the 1945-1960 period, the rosy years of Turkish-American relations. In these years, some in Turkey criticized the government for granting political and economic concessions to the U.S. which were, they thought, reminiscent of the infamous capitulations of the Ottoman period. Furthermore, they argued, Turkey did not become an equal ally but was downgraded to a U.S. colony. Many critics voiced their concerns that Turkey's internal and external affairs were shaped in accordance not with Turkish but with American interests. Last, but not least, many accused America of cultural imperialism. These anti-American views were repeated over the succeeding years with slight alterations. Hence, this study will attempt to shed light not only on the 1960s' fiercer version of anti-Americanism but also on the current debates.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Recent amateur and alternative uses of wet laboratory biology techniques have been called by many names. However, none of the terms currently in use include institutional, entrepreneurial and amateur engagements in biotechnology with non-scientific aims. In this article, the author introduces the more comprehensive concept of fringe biotechnology. While 'DIYbio' has in recent years become a term that covers a wide range of hobbyist approaches to biotechnology, it still excludes several other alternative biotech practices, such as amateur and artistic activities in institutional labs and educational facilities. This seems to imply a continued fundamental divide between the inside of academic and corporate science, and the outside, comprising public, social and cultural uses of the technologies. The author suggests that the term 'fringe biotechnology' opens up for studying biotech activities across the inside-outside divide, and presents a range of examples of fringe biotechnology.
Ethnic Studies	In 2010, a group of black and brown former gang members from South Los Angeles started a tour called LA Gang Tours, in which they give oral histories of their lives to an overwhelmingly white tourist population. Some local politicians, reporters, and activists contend that the tour is exploitative because tour guides profit off of LA's gang history. Using interviews, participant observation, and textual analysis, I argue that the exploitation critique misses tour guides' analyses that link racism and classism. Challenging the exploitation argument, I theorize tour guide labor as a lumpenproletariat's redemption, by which they use and critique capitalism.
Public Administration	This paper considers key drivers to climate policy development with an emphasis on the role of a jurisdiction's underlying energy resource. The states of Hawaii in the United States and Victoria in Australia provide an insightful comparative case study given their differing energy resources: Hawaii has no native fossil fuel resources but abundant renewable energy options while Victoria has an economy traditionally reliant on cheap, plentiful coal. The Advocacy Coalition Framework is applied to analyze why the two states, despite the different incentives provided by their energy resources, developed similar climate policies in the earlier period of policy response to global warming. Analysis finds the stable parameter of energy resources is counterbalanced by other policy drivers including public opinion, leadership and, in particular, features of policy-making particular to the subnational level that provide a different context for climate policy development to that offered at the national level.
Gerontology	ObjectiveGiven recent rises in out-of-pocket health expenses, we examined the financial well-being of older Australians with multiple health conditions and disabilities. MethodsThe 2014 General Social Survey was used to measure the: (i) current financial position; (ii) propensity to experience financial difficulties; and (iii) types of behaviours older people with multiple health conditions engage in to improve financial resilience. ResultsCompared to older Australians with no health conditions, respondents with multiple health conditions had lower incomes and assets and a higher propensity to hold consumer debt (once controls were included). They were at a higher risk of cash flow difficulties, dissaving to meet day-to-day living expenses and exclusion from financial providers. However, the majority of people with multiple health conditions engaged in financially resilient behaviours. ConclusionMany older Australians with multiple health conditions were in a financially precarious situation with implications for the ability to afford ongoing increases in out-of-pocket health-care costs. Policy Impact: Many older Australians with multiple health conditions are in a financially precarious situation. Although they engage in financially resilient behaviours, their health conditions place constraints on re-entry to the labour market to improve financial wellbeing. The increased financial burden for people with multiple and/or long-term health conditions emphasises the benefits of preventative health interventions along the lifespan for the benefit of older Australians.
Ethics	Little is known about how research assistants (RAs) protect participants in vulnerable circumstances. Using a critical qualitative method informed by feminist ethics, we ran five focus groups with experienced RAs. We identified two themes: (a) expressing moral competencies (subthemes: recognizing power, privilege, and vulnerability; adapting processes and providing support; understanding the sources of moral competencies) and (b) negotiating and making transparent roles and responsibilities (subthemes: separating responsibilities as a clinician from those of an RA; critically reflecting on the shared responsibilities of principal investigators and RAs; and identifying the role of the Research Ethics Committee). Although RAs possess a variety of moral competencies and have an important role in protecting research participants in vulnerable circumstances, that role is largely unrecognized.
Management	We propose a theoretical process model of the social construction of leadership that sheds light on the relationship between conscientiousness and leadership emergence. The socioanalytic theory of personality is invoked to hypothesize different mediational paths linking the two facets of conscientiousness, achievement striving and duty, with leadership emergence. We tested the theoretical model with data from 249 employees matched with data from 40 of their coworkers and 40 supervisors employed in a Fortune 500 organization. Results indicate that the relationship between achievement striving and leadership emergence is partially mediated by competitiveness, providing support for a getting-ahead path to leadership. In contrast, the relationship between duty and leadership emergence is, in part, carried forward by trust, helping role perceptions, and helping behavior, supporting a getting-along path to leadership. Consistent with the self versus other distinction theoretically posited with regard to the facets of conscientiousness, although helping behavior is a predictor of leadership emergence, achievement strivers help only when they perceive helping as being an in-role requirement, whereas dutiful individuals enlarge their helping role perceptions.
Education & Educational Research	As the Every Student Succeeds Act is returning authority over teacher evaluation policies back to the states, policy makers at the state level have the opportunity to revise their policies. But who will they listen to when it comes to potential reforms? The author surveyed education policy makers to determine to what degree teachers, education leaders, and the general public are likely to influence their decisions. Their responses revealed that policy makers value voices of constituents over those of the general public, that Democrats and Republicans respond differently to teacher preferences, that responses to individual teacher voices are different from responses to union voices, and that school leaders' voices are valued by almost all policy makers.
Education & Educational Research	As colleges and universities aim for greater diversity in their undergraduate populations, one population researchers consider is first-generation students, or students whose parents do not have a college education. The research reported here addresses first-generation college students' discipline of study (e.g., biology) and its impact on their persistence. Exploring how female, low-income, first-generation college students evaluate their persistence within undergraduate science learning environments contributes to understanding how gender and social class influence persistence in STEM fields. Two White, female, low-income, first-generation college students were interviewed during their last year in college. Using constant comparative coding methods and Ricoeur's (Ricoeur [1984] Time and narrative, Volume I (K. McLaughlin & D. Pellauer, Trans.). Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press) description of narrative construction, common tensions were identified related to participants' descriptions of undergraduate science as competitive. These persistence-related tensions are (1) differing experiences in lecture and lab, (2) managing time to work, study, and maintain family relationships, and (3) weighing their personal (family) priorities against the longer time it would take them to reach their science-related career goals. These tensions depict a traditional undergraduate science learning environment focused on individuals and abstract knowledge that positions female lower-income students as academic non-competitors because of the importance of kinship ties and physical skills in their cultural background (Lareau [2002] American Sociological Review 67(5), 747-776; Lareau [2003] Unequal childhoods: Class, race, and family life. Berkeley: University of California Press). The participants' experiences support that the gendered and classed expectations needed to succeed in a science environment could be somewhat alleviated through reforms to traditional lecture and laboratory undergraduate science courses that promote cooperative student learning groups and integration of lecture with hands-on activities.

Geography	This article addresses the analysis of theoretical and methodological concepts of the quality of human and social capital and their relation to the theory of spatial polarisation. Selected conditions for the development of human and social capital and their territorial differentiation in Czechia are evaluated. On the basis of an evaluation of component indicators of human capital (the ratio of university educated residents in the population over 15 years of age as well as an economic burden index) and social capital (voter participation in municipal elections and the number of candidates divided by the number of offices to be filled in the 2006 municipal elections) problematic areas are identified at a micro-regional level (the network of municipalities having a certified municipal authority).
Area Studies	Sub-Saharan Africa's social science literature has primarily focused on phenomena within the rural village context. Urban analysis is currently gaining momentum with concentration on the continent's capital cities, and in particular the mega cities of Lagos, Kinshasa and Johannesburg. Urban settlements of more modest size and political importance have received scant attention. This article explores the urban growth dynamics of Katoro, a rapidly expanding small town in Tanzania's northwest mining frontier. Tracing Katoro's early origins and its growth as a regional trading centre with respect to design, natural resource utilization and service development, it is argued that the transition from rural to urban settlement is far from accidental. The practical concerns and cosmopolitan vision of the settlement's leading early settlers set Katoro on a trajectory of demographic expansion and economic growth through successive stages of Tanzanian socialist and neo-liberalist policies. Responding to the opportunities afforded by regional gold mining and international border trade, longstanding residents and recent migrants created a thriving centre for the provision of trade and services that had oboomo characteristics distinct from gold strike settlements in the surrounding area. Katoro's success must be seen in scalar terms, and raises issues about analytical biases in African urban studies. Current literature dramatizing the unpredictability and chaos of urban life in Africa's mega cities has taken centre stage, leaving the dynamics of smaller urban settlements, foundational to the future of urban Africa largely ignored. This article seeks to address the literature's scalar imbalance and draw attention to the meso level between individual livelihood activities and macro economic urban performance.
Law	"In this Article we show that Citizens United v. FEC, arguably the most important First Amendment case of the new millennium, is as much about corporate law as it is about the First Amendment. Unfortunately, the reasoning in the opinion is predicated on a fundamental misconception about both the legal status and the fundamental nature of the corporation. Specifically, Citizens United, which prohibited the government from restricting independent expenditures for corporate communications, and held that corporations enjoy the same free speech rights to engage in political spending as human citizens, is grounded on the erroneous theory that corporations are ""associations of citizens"" rather than what they actually are: legally autonomous entities that are conceptually distinct from those who own their stock. We reject the Citizens United majority's conception of the corporation as an ""associations of citizens"" and reaffirm its status as an artificial, metaphysical, and legal construct that exists separate and apart from its investors. In fact, the entire point of the incorporation process is to permit the creation of a legal entity that is not an association of individuals, but rather a discrete legal entity whose rights and obligations are distinct from those of its creators, investors, managers, and other constituents. We observe the utter lack of any authority for the Citizens United majority's view that the corporation is an association of individuals. In light of pointing out that corporations are creatures of state law, not federal law, we argue that determinations about the nature of the corporation, such as whether the corporation is a distinct juridical entity or an association of individuals, should be made by reference to state law, not federal law. In Citizens United, the Court either ignored or misunderstood the traditional, universally-held state corporate law conception of the corporation and in so doing subjected American investors to suffer the involuntary use of their entrusted capital for speech that has no rational connection to their reason for investing. This is bad corporate law making bad constitutional law. We also identify an irony. It was the legislative branch, not the judicial branch that is supposedly more learned in the law, that was the one that understood corporate law when addressing political speech. Congress considered the nature of corporations when enacting McCain-Feingold and took into account that corporations are not associations of citizens, but separate, state-created entities formed for reasons that cannot be rationally attributed to the shared political or philosophical views of their investors. As such, Congress allowed corporations broad freedom to engage in political speech, but only by using funds voluntarily contributed for this purpose by stockholders to a corporate-controlled political action committee (PAC). By this means, Congress left ample room for the corporation to act as a collective vehicle for stockholders who wished to affiliate for that purpose, but protected other stockholders from being forced to subsidize speech that the mere decision to invest cannot plausibly be thought to endorse. By contrast, in Citizens United, the Court either ignored or misunderstood the traditional corporate law concept of the corporation and thereby subjected millions of American investors to suffer the involuntary use of their entrusted capital for speech that has no rational connection to their decision to buy stock. This is bad corporate law making bad constitutional law."
Demography	BACKGROUND In modern, highly developed countries the association between education and fertility seems to be equivocal: A negative influence of education mainly applies to women, while among men the correlation is often positive or negligible. Although the gender differences have been examined in depth, couples' procreative behaviour treated as the result of a conflict between male and female characteristics is still understudied. OBJECTIVE This study aims to investigate couples' reproductive behaviour among contemporary European populations with regard to (in) equality between partners' educational levels and the joint educational resources of a couple. Various measures of educational endogamy are considered. METHODS The hurdle zero-truncated Poisson model within the Bayesian framework is applied. The data comes from the first wave of the Generations and Gender Survey for Austria, Bulgaria, and France. RESULTS Homogamous low-educated partners have, on average, the highest fertility. The highly educated postpone childbearing and have a smaller number of children in all countries except France, where their completed fertility does not differ from that of other unions. The effect of hypergamy is insignificant and is thus similar to homogamy in medium education. Hypogamy negatively influences fertility in Bulgaria and Austria, while in France the effect is insignificant. CONCLUSIONS The small variation in fertility due to couple-level education observed in France indicates that proper institutional support for families might help couples overcome possible obstacles and enhance fertility for all educational profiles. CONTRIBUTION This study provides a perspective on the relationship between reproductive behaviour and educational pairing in varying country-specific contexts. It reaches key conclusions on contemporary fertility regarding both childlessness and parenthood and their association with couples' different educational profiles.
Area Studies	This article examines Turkish national role conceptions in 1992-2012, identified based on leading Turkish foreign policy-makers' statements. It contends that the notion that shift of axis arguments proliferated in the AKP (Adalet ve Kalknma Partisi) era is misleading. The pattern of Turkish foreign policy roles expressed by the political elite in the period under examination suggests a gradual change toward an ambitious attitude rather than a shift of axis. A plausible explanation would be that the foreign policy roles under any government heavily reflect objective national interests and capabilities, thus a shifting of axis is unlikely to occur without a significant change in these variables.
Information Science & Library Science	Purpose - This paper sets out to examine the degree to which General Finnish Thesaurus (GFT) and FinMeSh cover various semantic expressions of medical concepts in patients' questions and physicians' answers concerning cardiovascular diseases. The former represents arty persons' information needs. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 question-answer pairs were collected in a medical web site. Concepts and their expressions (terms) with their semantic relations were identified in questions and answers. Findings - FinMeSh covered 65 per cent and GFT 41 per cent of all medical terms in texts. The expressions of patients and physicians matched better with FinMeSh than GFT regardless of the type of expression. The difference in favour of FinMeSh was typically about 25 per cent-units. Originality/value - The low fit With users' vocabularies makes GFT a poor tool for supporting searching, whereas the relatively high fit of FinMeSH suggests that it is a reasonable tool in assisting searching. Conclusions concerning the bridging of these two thesauri sire discussed.
Business	"Purpose - This paper aims to show how instant messaging (IM) service providers are helping and hindering societal mental health among young adults. That is, IM services provide users with an ability to obtain instantaneous and inexpensive support in their time of need. However, excessive internet usage may place IM users at risk of experiencing symptoms associated with internet addiction and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a framework obtained from coding qualitative data. They test the framework with structural equation methodology and latent mean analysis from data collected from younger-aged Chinese and American IM users in two studies. Findings - Younger-aged IM users in both China and the US obtain social support from their virtual networks. However, both groups of IM users show signs of elevated levels of internet addiction and of being at risk of experiencing symptoms associated with ADHD. Research limitations/implications - Excessive IM and internet usage may hinder young adults' mental health, and the problem is likely to grow in the future. The work confirms recent trends in US psychology to consider internet addiction a mental health disorder. Social implications - Both service and public health researchers are encouraged to consider the impact of technological services, including internet usage and IM, on consumer health and well-being. People with ADHD are particularly susceptible to internet addiction; thus, technological services may be damaging society's mental health. Originality/value - The paper illustrates how researchers can engage in transformative service research, referring to research with implications that affect global consumer health and well-being. The work also shows a ""dark side"" to services and the unintended consequences of service technology on public health. Both topics have not been explored in service research."
Family Studies	Triangulation is an important subject in marriage and family therapy. Chinese family culture emphasizes consanguinity, which means that adult children have great difficulty separating from their original families and establishing clear boundaries. This results in the unique problem of family-of-origin triangulation in Chinese marriages. The current study explored the relationship between family-of-origin triangulation and the marital quality of Chinese couples, and examined the mediating role of in-law relationships. A total of 341 Chinese couples, ranging from newlyweds to those with school-aged children, participated in the survey. The results demonstrate that family-of-origin triangulation of both husbands and wives negatively predicted wives' marital quality, whereas husbands' marital quality was only predicted by their own family-of-origin triangulation. Moreover, family-of-origin triangulation not only predicted marital quality directly, but also indirectly by damaging the relationships with in-laws. The actor effects of family-of-origin triangulation were partially mediated by in-law relationships, whereas the partner effects of husbands' triangulation on wives' marital quality was fully mediated by in-law relationships. Family therapists in China should pay more attention to intergenerational relationships and reestablishing the sub-system boundaries of husband and wife, and at the same time, focus on repairing the couple's relationships with the in-laws.
International Relations	This article interrogates the sexual ideology of Finnish peacebuilding, the country's foreign policy brand and the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda by examining the experiences of women written out of history'. Using the method of writing back' I juxtapose the construction of a gender-friendly global peacebuilder identity with experiences in Finland after the Lapland War (1944-45) and in post-conflict Aceh, Indonesia (1976-2005). Although being divided temporarily and geographically, these two contexts form an intimate part of the abjected and invisible part of the Finnish WPS agenda, revealing a number of colonial and violent overtones of postwar reconstruction: economic and political postwar dystopia of Skolt Sami and neglect of Acehnese women's experiences in branding the peace settlement and its implementation as a success. Jointly they critique and challenge both the gender/women-friendly peacebuilder identity construction of Finland and locate the sexual ideology of WPS to that of political economy and post-conflict political, legal and economic reforms. The article illustrates how the Finnish foreign policy brand has constructed the country as a global problem-solver and peacemaker, drawing on the heteronormative myth of already achieved gender equality on the one hand and, on the other, tamed asexual female subjectivity: the good woman' as peacebuilder or victim of violence. By drawing attention to violent effects of the global WPS agenda demanding decolonialization, I suggest that the real success of the WPS agenda should be evaluated by those who have been written out'.
Gerontology	Older people living alone (OPLA) are considered vulnerable because of fewer resources, such as social support. As self-management becomes increasingly important in chronic care, evidence is needed on how to better support OPLA. This review synthesizes the evidence from 32 publications on the challenges as well as strategies of OPLA in managing chronic conditions. On the basis of a systematic database search and review process, being independent and being at home were identified as crucial when living alone in later life; both involve decision making and the adjustment of routines to manage everyday life and chronic conditions. These findings show that OPLA are vulnerable because of difficult living situations, limited resources, or a lack of support, and they actively manage their conditions using various strategies to remain independent, but these may cause fragile arrangements that can jeopardize independence. Awareness of these strategies is a starting point to develop interventions for self-management support in chronic illness.
Public Administration	This article provides a retrospective look at the Japanese model of industrial development. This model combined an institutional approach to production based around the Japanese Firm (Aoki's, J-mode) and strategic state intervention in industry by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). For a long period, the alignment of state and corporate interests appeared to match the wider public interest as the Japanese economy prospered. However, since the early 1990s, the global ambitions of the corporate sector have contributed to a significant 'hollowing out' of Japan's industrial base. As the world today looks for a new direction in economic management, we suggest the Japanese model provides policy-makers with a salutary lesson in tying the wider public interest with those of the corporate sector.
History	The historiography of the Indian mutiny (1857-8) suggests that livelihood classes responded to the episode differently, but pays more attention to the agricultural classes than the urban commercial ones in studying the response. This article revises the economic history of the rebellion by showing that commercial interests were influenced by concerns over security of property, and that they, as much as landed interests, shaped the course of the rebellion.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Low fertility in modern societies challenges evolutionary social scientists. A comparative analysis of less developed countries investigated various possible predictors of low fertility including urbanization, monogamous marriage, level of participation in the monetary economy (GDP), and low infant mortality. Using a sample of 45 countries broken out by urban and rural location, each of these predictors of total fertility was significant in a regression analysis (r (2) = .76) that controlled for survey year, geographic latitude, sex ratio, and geographic hemisphere. Multivariate prediction estimated that the demographic shift (TFR < 2.6) occurs when infant mortality falls below 33 per thousand, when polygyny reaches zero, and when GDP per capita rises above US$20,508. (The low fertility at high latitudes, reported by Barber, was further found explainable in terms of monogamous marriage). Declining fertility in modern societies evidently constitutes an adaptive response to ecological conditions and is largely predictable from them.
Transportation	On 16 April 2013, the European Parliament adopted a new, amended airport ground handling Regulation, which will replace the old Directive 96/67 EC on ground handling services. The new Regulation will further open up European airports for competition on the ground handling market. Even long before the introduction of Directive 96/67/EC, Amsterdam Airport has had a liberalised handling regime. Against the background of the further liberalisation of the European ground handling market, this paper investigates the characteristics of the open ground handling market for air cargo at Amsterdam Airport and the lessons that can be learnt from the Amsterdam experience. We find that an open handling market brings greater freedom of choice for airlines and lower handling fees. However, we do not see any (serious) market failure for the airport that would justify intervention by the market regulator, by limiting the number of handlers for example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Management	The current body of literature with regard to supply chain vulnerability pays limited attention to how companies actually evaluate and manage risk. A second limitation is the scarce use of empirical evidence. Aiming at reducing these gaps, this work proposes a new conceptual model by which companies can assess their upstream vulnerability. The development process for the model involved two steps. First, based on a literature review, a draft of the assessment model was designed and operationalised via a questionnaire. Then, to refine the model and to verify its discriminant ability, case studies were conducted. The model is able to effectively compare the riskiness of the context in which a company operates with the firm's preparedness in risk management, providing guidance in evaluating and reducing upstream vulnerability.
Demography	In this article, we investigate the influences of material aspirations on migration in Nepal, positing that material aspirations may have important influences on decisions to migrate and where to locate. We discuss a theoretical model explaining how these aspirations might be key influences in the migration decision. Using detailed continuous migration histories from the 2008-2012 Chitwan Valley Family Study, we estimate logistic and alternative-specific conditional logit models to examine how material aspirations in Nepal influence migration rates and destinations. Our empirical analyses provide strong evidence that material aspirations have large effects on overall rates of migration and affect destination-specific migration rates, particularly for relatively wealthy Western and Asian destinations. We also show an interaction effect between material aspirations and destination-specific expected earnings in influencing people's migration choices. It is the people with high aspirations who migrate to destinations with high earning potentials.
Ethics	In order to successfully introduce responsibility-sensitivity into theories of justice (distributive and relational) and theories of political morality (broadly conceived) it is not enough to merely draw distinctions between (i) different models of what responsibility-sensitivity requires in itself and (ii) different normative grounds of, or justifications for, responsibility-sensitivity. We must also draw distinctions between (iii) different roles played by responsibility sensitivity within our theories; (iv) different accounts of the strength of responsibility-sensitivity within theories of justice; (v) different accounts of the strength of responsibility-sensitivity within theories of political morality; and (vi) different conceptions of the other requirements also incorporated into theories of justice and theories of political morality. The intended payoff of all this distinction-drawing is twofold: first, a more accurate, comprehensive, and illuminating account of the nature of the position of responsibility-sensitivity within theories of justice and theories of political morality; and, second, paving the way for a more sophisticated and analytically sharp research agenda on the subject of whether or not responsibility-sensitivity should have a position in our theories of normative political concepts in the face of mounting scepticism over its doing so, owing in part to the harshness/abandonment objection and the unfreedom objection.
Substance Abuse	This study aims at investigating alcoholic inpatients' attachment system by combining a measurement of adult attachment style (AAQ, Hazan and Shaver, 1987. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52(3): 511-524) and the degree of alexithymia (BVAQ, Bermond and Vorst, 1998. Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire, Unpublished data). Data were collected from 101 patients (71 men, 30 women) admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Belgium for alcohol use-related problems, between September 2003 and December 2004. To investigate the research question, cluster analyses and regression analyses are performed. We found that it makes sense to distinguish three subgroups of alcoholic inpatients with different degrees of impairment of the attachment system. Our results also reveal a pattern of correspondence between the severity of psychiatric symptomspersonality disorder traits (ADP-IV), anxiety (STAI), and depression (BDI-II-Nl)and the severity of the attachment system's impairment. Limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are highlighted and implications for diagnosis and treatment are discussed.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	"Users, funders and providers of official statistics want estimates that are ""wider, deeper, quicker, better, cheaper"" (channeling Tim Holt, former head of the UK Office for National Statistics), to which I would add ""more relevant"" and ""less burdensome"". Since World War II, we have relied heavily on the probability sample survey as the best we could do - and that best being very good - to meet these goals for estimates of household income and unemployment, self-reported health status, time use, crime victimization, business activity, commodity flows, consumer and business expenditures, et al. Faced with secularly declining unit and item response rates and evidence of reporting error, we have responded in many ways, including the use of multiple survey modes, more sophisticated weighting and imputation methods, adaptive design, cognitive testing of survey items, and other means to maintain data quality. For statistics on the business sector, in order to reduce burden and costs, we long ago moved away from relying solely on surveys to produce needed estimates, but, to date, we have not done that for household surveys, at least not in the United States. I argue that we can and must move from a paradigm of producing the best estimates possible from a survey to that of producing the best possible estimates to meet user needs from multiple data sources. Such sources include administrative records and, increasingly, transaction and Internet-based data. I provide two examples - household income and plumbing facilities - to illustrate my thesis. I suggest ways to inculcate a culture of official statistics that focuses on the end result of relevant, timely, accurate and cost-effective statistics and treats surveys, along with other data sources, as means to that end."
Geography	The Peruvian government is attempting to implement a formalization plan to deal with the chaotic expansion of small-scale mining activities in the Amazon. However, this plan has been contested, delayed and halted by local miners. Why exactly has it been so hard for the government to enforce a formalization plan in Madre de Dios? This article aims to answer this question by analysing both government efforts to establish control over the region and the challenges it faces in enforcing its formalization plan. It is argued that current resistance to and conflict over the formalization process in Madre de Dios reveals a state governance problem due to the region having been historically governed as a zone for exploitation rather than for social and economic development. Similarly, the analysis highlights the absence of major corporations through which the state can establish a basis for governance, as in other parts of the country.
Communication	The main aim of this study was to examine the norms of expressing emotions on social media. Specifically, the perceived appropriateness (i.e. injunctive norms) of expressing six discrete emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, disappointment, worry, joy, and pride) was investigated across four different social media platforms. Drawing on data collected in March 2016 among 1201 young Dutch users (15-25 years), we found that positive expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions across all platforms. In line with the objective of the study, some platform differences were found. The expression of negative emotions was rated as most appropriate for WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, some gender differences were found, while age showed little variations. Overall, the results contribute to a more informed understanding of emotion expression online.
History	"In the late 1930s, Protestants across Europe debated how best to resist the threat of encroaching secularism and radical secular politics. Some insisted that communism remained the greatest threat to Europe""s Christian civilization, while others used new theories of totalitarianism to imagine Nazism and communism as different but equal menaces. This article explores debates about Protestantism, secularism, and communism in three locations - Hungary, Germany, and Great Britain. It concludes that Protestants perceived Europe""s culture war against secularism in very different ways, according to their geopolitical location. The points of conflict between Europe""s Protestants foreshadowed the dramatic shifts in the coordinates of Protestant Europe""s culture wars after 1945."
Education & Educational Research	Since its inception in 1992 Ofsted (The Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) has inspected schools under Section 9 of the Education (Schools) Act 1992; Section 10 of the School Inspections Act 1996; and Section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Pressure on England to improve its system of education has not only emerged from the national need for all schools to serve their pupils well, but has also been prompted by an increasing emphasis on international league tables such as that produced by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). In tables such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), England is viewed as underperforming against comparable countries. As a result, Ofsted has introduced what the agency terms to be one of the most stringent and demanding inspection frameworks since its inception. This framework reduces the previous 29 inspection judgements to just four, purportedly placing a far greater emphasis on the professional judgement of the inspector and representing a major departure from the tick box' approach which characterised previous frameworks. This paper examines the paradoxical fate of inspector professional judgement and concludes that whilst this may appear to signal a rapprochement between inspectors and teaching profession, there are considerable tensions when professional judgement is considered alongside quality control within a highly complex system. The study concludes that in order that inspection attains credibility as a method by which to govern education, this shift requires a more considered approach to ways in which this professional judgement can be effective within the challenging environment of the English education system.
Area Studies	"This article examines Chinese-led regional forums in the developing world where the Chinese preponderance of economic power is self-evident, its financial largesse is readily utilised to sustain these endeavours, its bureaucracies are empowered to guide the conduct of institutional activities, and its normative intentions and interests are given fullest expression.This assessment of two such Chinese-instigated regional forums in the developing world suggests that despite the professed norms on political equality"" and mutual benefit"" and efforts to ensure the maintenance of Chinese interests over time, China""s stance is increasingly contested by developing country member states. These challenges invariably take the form of struggles over the structuring of key administrative organs and the decision-making process and as such are reflective of norms, interests and expectations held by developing country members. In other words although China holds a preponderance of structural power within these regional forums there is an ongoing process of socialisationdriven by developing country member statesaimed at reshaping China""s behaviour to bring it more closely in line with the other members"" interests."
Communication	Despite its apparent simplicity, the speech act of complimenting has received a great deal of attention in the literature. However, studies have mostly focused on compliments' realization in face-to-face conversational exchanges, while they have often been neglected in other channels such as online communication. This article is intended to redress the balance in support of online exchanges. More specifically, we aim to investigate how users of online social networks like Facebook use compliments to evaluate others and strengthen social rapport in English and Spanish. In order to do so, we gathered two balanced corpora in both languages (50 examples in each language). The samples were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed using a systemic functional framework. The analysis reveals that compliments constitute a system of choices where several available options help Facebook users to encode their evaluation of the other from various perspectives (e.g. as an emotion, as an unquestionable truth, etc.). Furthermore, results also show that despite superficial similarities, compliments in both languages follow remarkably different frequencies of use which reflect deep cultural differences.
Political Science	In Russia, it has been alleged for some years now that western historiography is distorting the history of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Two books about Russian rule in the Caucasus disprove this assertion. Jeronim Perovic presents a nuanced picture of rebellion and adaptation in the multi-ethnic region of the Northern Caucasus. Philipp Ammon looks to the Southern Caucasus and illustrates how in Georgia, Russia has been perceived sometimes as a protector and sometimes as a colonial power.
Communication	"Based on Internet Ethnography of a popular female live streamer on YouTube Gaming, this article theorizes how game live streaming invokes new forms of paid emotional labor that intersect with traditionally feminized demands of unpaid attentive and caring work. Drawing from an intersectional feminist framework that takes seriously small data and everyday life, this article suggests there is a shift toward one""s work being part of a personalized media economy that can relate to one""s audience. This study concludes with an invitation to think how folks under neoliberal capitalism are willing to leave secure, traditional 9-to-5 jobs, in order to be a professional gamer without any social safety nets and ultimately be always-on-the-clock."
International Relations	The global governance literature is increasingly concerned with questions regarding the purpose of global governance and the sources of power in world politics. One strand of this debate centers on nongovernmental organizations and to what extent their role in global politics and policy processes is legitimate. This article uses Greenpeace India as an instructive case study to analyze the legitimacy problems facing international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) campaigning on a global policy platform in the context of domestic politics. The article argues that the undertheorization of INGO s' agency as global actors is likely to reproduce processes of structural delegitimation that maintain a discrepancy between two of their legitimacy constructs. This is exemplified in questions about their representativeness and restrictive regulatory frameworks that undermine their legality. This article proposes that developing a more nuanced empirical understanding of the endogenous and exogenous limits of INGOs' power can help bridge the theoretical gap between their global and local agencies.
International Relations	"That Russia, a declining power, has emerged as the most assertive challenger to the US-led global order, while China, the most dynamic rising power, has largely worked within the established order, is surprising. It contradicts the expectations of power transition theory, which sees rising powers as the most likely challengers. This article tries to tackle this puzzle by examining the two states"" relative positions in the international system. China can grow and prosper by free-riding on the hegemonic order established by the United States, and is thus cautious about challenging it. As a declining power, Russia is dissatisfied with the order and determined to change it to reverse its decline and maintain its great power status. For the time being, the two great powers"" interests align. China uses Russia to push back against the aspects of US hegemony it dislikes (thereby avoiding the costs of a direct challenge), while Russia needs China""s backing to mount its challenge. However, going forward, the same structural dynamics that now favour the relationship may work against it: should Russia""s challenge start to destabilize the system it may also jeopardize China""s peaceful rise, causing rifts between the two powers. New US president Donald Trump has promised to seek a tougher line towards China and a rapprochement with Russia. However, given its strong structural foundations these policies are unlikely to weaken the China-Russia partnership, and could even strengthen it."
Demography	BACKGROUND Switzerland hosts one of the largest and most diversified migrant populations in Europe, while currently reinforcing restrictive immigration policies. Knowledge on Swiss immigrant-native marriages, as ultimate signposts of integration, is limited. OBJECTIVE We explore the role of origin group and birth cohort in the emergence and dissolution of mixed marriages in Switzerland among both natives and immigrants. METHODS Based on a sample of 12,827 respondents from the 2013 Swiss Family and Generations Survey, we fit competing-risks models for entry into first marriage, and Cox proportional hazards models for entry into (first) divorce. RESULTS We find evidence of a segmented marriage market, with migrants from neighbouring Western European countries having higher chances of getting and staying married to a Swiss native. As opposed to natives, migrants from younger cohorts are progressively less likely to intermarry. CONCLUSIONS In line with segmented assimilation claims, results suggest differences in integration pathways between immigrant groups. Findings also point to the reactive ethnicity of marginalized groups (e.g., Turks and ex-Yugoslavs) in response to an increasingly hostile immigration climate. Decreasing (inter) marriage with natives among young immigrants reflects shifting marriage market conditions over the last decades.
Ethnic Studies	"This article critically examines #AllLivesMatter, which emerged as a rebuttal to #BlackLivesMatter, arguing, in spite of its universalist pretentions, that it represents a cloaked identitarian politics which through a hegemonic narrative (re)presents itself as a radically inclusionary counter-narrative. I argue All Lives Matter exemplifies an anti-identity identity politics by invoking rhetoric in opposition to racial identities while smuggling in a somewhat elastic ""postracial"" neoliberal subject as the foundational identity around which this new mobilisation is organised. The article outlines a definition for anti-identity identity politics and uses this as a lens for analysing All Lives Matter in order to interrogate this keyword."
Family Studies	This study examined the financial management practices of 62 participants in Smart Steps stepfamily education courses 1 year following their course completion. Qualitative interviews revealed 29 participants changed their financial practices as a result of the course, 29 did not change, and 4 provided unclear responses. Common reasons for no change included having functional practices that predated the relationship education course or financial difficulties remaining, despite course participation. Common reasons for change included working together as a couple and implementing budget or saving practices. Latino participants were more likely to report change than were European Americans. Findings and implications highlight both the opportunities and challenges associated with teaching financial education as part of a relationship education program.
Development Studies	The role of microfinance as a tool to fight against poverty by providing financial services to the poor and microenterprises has become an accepted principle worldwide. However, this key role can be accomplished only if the microfinance institutions (MFIs) assuming it are sustainable, i.e., can operate in the long run without subsidy. In this paper, we define market-based MFIs as MFIs that face competition in quality and price of their products in the market in which they operate, and operate under market discipline on the liability side of their balance sheet. Their ability to collect funds from sources under the discipline of funds providers helps them to be independent of subsidy and makes their operations sustainable. It is shown that several elements are fundamental to the success of market-based MFIS, including internalization of conflicts of interest, macroeconomic and sectorial policies, and an appropriate regulatory and supervisory environment.
History	This article highlights the relationship between the failures' of municipal governance and the reproduction of its power in the colonial city. It examines the everyday operations of the Delhi Municipality between 1863 and 1910 and shows how the failure' to promote urban renewal actually provided opportunities' for the municipality's own longevity. After the Rebellion of 1857, the Delhi Municipality was invested with a wide variety of powers to check sanitary offences and regulate building construction in Delhi. This article discusses how this very growth and centralisation of powers created severe challenges for the functions of the municipality. The growing complexity of its operations, recommendations of experts, costs of ambitious projects and resistance from city dwellers, it is suggested, constantly subverted municipal intentions. Yet, in bringing to light the failure' of municipal policies, this article will argue that failure was profoundly productive. Municipal failure' was always accompanied by the growth in its bureaucratic capabilities and regulatory powers.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Temple stay is a creative form of religious tourism in Korea that offers an authentic local experience at a Buddhist temple. This study is to describe the experiences of international participants during their overnight temple stay. Based on field research with in-depth interviews, this study result indicates that participants regarded temple stay as a multicultural retreat in a religious and therapeutic setting to promote their ultimate wellbeing. In the intersection of culture, religion, and tourism, this study offers a framework to understand the essence of temple stay experience to modern individuals based on the Mandala of Health model.
Education & Educational Research	Using analytic autoethnography, this paper discusses the influences and outcomes that shaped a 30-month project between a Russian and an English university trying to develop a dual-award in educational leadership. It explores the drivers, benefits, hindrances and affordances of international collaboration, before critiquing the literature on contemporary Russian culture. It then maps how various factors including money, language, hospitality, trust, commitment and flexibility affected the project. It concludes that unequal partnerships can result in shared learning, but that programme validation is harder to achieve if either institution imposes unrealistic financial constraints, lacks flexibility, or fails to recruit a high-level champion.

Business, Finance	This paper analyzes the information effect of involuntary delisting and the possibility of informed trading in the Korean stock market. We find that the abnormal return is between 80% and 90% due to involuntary delisting in the Korean market, where liquidity all but disappears as a result of delisting. Prior to delisting, however, domestic individual investors are net buyers of delisted firms while both domestic institutional investors and foreign investors are net sellers. On the other hand, the share ownership of large shareholders, on average, declines by more than 30% over the course of two years prior to involuntary delisting. Using delisting probability model, we find that the change in the share ownership of large shareholders is a significant predictor of delisting while that of domestic institutional investors and foreign investors is not. Our findings suggest that large shareholders reduce their share ownership in anticipation of delisting and that there is a wealth transfer from individual investors to large shareholders surrounding involuntary delisting in markets where the separation between ownership and control is weak and the participation of retail investors is large.

Business, Finance	We examine whether the switch to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) has affected the value relevance and persistence of net income. In addition, since IFRS adoption has involved changes in the location of nonrecurring items in the income statement, we also examine whether these changes have influenced the value relevance, persistence, and predictive value of the main income measures. Using a sample of Spanish listed firms, we find an increase in the value relevance of net income and non-significant changes in its persistence after 2005. We also find that nonrecurring items were value relevant in the pre-adoption period and that the operating income is more value relevant after IFRS adoption. This suggests that the significant increase in the value relevance of operating income could be explained by the inclusion in this income measure of former extraordinary and special items. We also observe that the former extraordinary section under SAS (Spanish Accounting Standards) was persistent, whereas the income measure of net profit/loss from discontinued operations under IFRS is neither value relevant nor persistent. We do not find significant changes in the attributes of financial income, but we do observe an increase in the value relevance of other consolidated items and corporation tax after IFRS adoption.
Nursing	"Nurses with doctorates are increasing in number throughout the world, yet the multitude of roles they play following graduation is unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe clinical nurses' perceptions and expectations of the role of doctorally-prepared nurses in Iran. A qualitative study, using a content analysis approach was conducted with 43 clinical nurses chosen using a purposive sampling strategy. Oral, semi-structured and written interviews were used to generate data. During data analysis, three main themes emerged; ""advantages of the doctoral degree"", ""clarification of doctorally-prepared nurses' role in clinical practice"", and ""unmet expectations of doctorally-prepared nurses"". An understanding of the expectations of nurses on the role of doctorally-prepared nurses is needed to improve the collaboration between clinical nurses and doctorally-prepared nurses; remove misunderstandings on the abilities and skills of doctorally-prepared nurses; incorporate the expectations into doctoral education in order to facilitate their collaboration; and also remove the theory and practice gap through the utilisation of doctorally-prepared nurses' knowledge and skills in practice.

Criminology & Penology	This study explored a sample of 244 UK adult male offenders convicted of offences involving indecent images of children (IIOC): 120 had a previous contact child sexual offence (defined as dual offenders) and 124 had no evidence of an offence against a child (defined as non-contact offenders). Offender groups were compared regarding their socio-demographic characteristics, previous convictions and IIOC possession. Key discriminatory factors that differentiated dual offenders were: access to children, previous offence history, sexual grooming and possession of IIOC that depicts similar-aged victims. In contrast, non-contact offenders could be identified from their greater amount and wider range of IIOC possession. The results suggest a homology between Internet behaviours, IIOC possession and victim selection. Implications for law enforcement agencies are discussed in terms of assisting investigative prioritisation by identifying those most at risk of committing sexual abuse against children.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Bell (2012) catalogued unit root factors contained in linear filters used in seasonal adjustment (model-based or from the X-11 method) but noted that, for model-based seasonal adjustment, special cases could arise where filters could contain more unit root factors than was indicated by the general results. This article reviews some special cases that occur with canonical ARIMA model based adjustment in which, with some commonly used ARIMA models, the symmetric seasonal filters contain two extra nonseasonal differences (i.e., they include an extra (1 - B)(1 - F)). This increases by two the degree of polynomials in time that are annihilated by the seasonal filter and reproduced by the seasonal adjustment filter. Other results for canonical ARIMA adjustment that are reported in Bell (2012), including properties of the trend and irregular filters, and properties of the asymmetric and finite filters, are unaltered in these special cases. Special cases for seasonal adjustment with structural ARIMA component models are also briefly discussed.
Criminology & Penology	The fatal shooting of a young, black, and male citizen named Michael Brown by a white male police officer in Ferguson (MO) generated political and media backlash that continues to erode law enforcement legitimacy today. Law enforcement is sensitive to changes in the public discourse on their profession and has responded in kind. A plethora of discussion has focused on the potential existence of a so-called ?Ferguson Effect?, whereby de-policing has emerged among officers as a result of concerns about being subjected to negative media scrutiny for racial profiling or excessive use of force, in turn increasing crime rates. Unfortunately, the ?Ferguson Effect? is long on anecdotes but short on data. To better understand officers? attitudes, perspectives, and strategies and the way in which the negative press related to the Ferguson incident interacted with these, in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 law enforcement officials were supplemented with participant observations of officer deployments in two southern State counties in the United States. Officer confidence, morale, and policing strategies were queried within the post-Ferguson era. The data suggest that there had been an increased conceptual awareness of procedural justice but also a reduction in officer morale and emphasis on proactive policing strategies, and that Ferguson was often drawn upon as a reference point among officers. The implications for these findings are discussed in terms of future police policies and practices within a procedural justice framework that seeks to reduce crime and increase law enforcement legitimacy.
Business, Finance	In this paper we determine the separating equilibrium contracts for high and low risks in a Rothschild-Stiglitz competitive market, under the monotone likelihood ratio property. We suppose that the policyholders have nonexpected utility, order risks according to first-order stochastic dominance and moreover that the high risks are strictly weakly risk averse. We prove that the high risks obtain full coverage. We determine the low risks' contract as an optimal solution of a non-convex problem. Under technical conditions, we show that the non-convex problem has a solution and we characterize the optimal solution.
Gerontology	The objective of this study was to compare the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity interval training (MIIT) programs, both with a suspension training system, on several fall risk factors in healthy older adults. A total of 82 participants (68.23 +/- 2.97 years) were randomized to HIIT (n = 28), MIIT (n = 27), or control (n = 27) groups. Balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale), fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International), dynamic balance (Timed Up and Go test), and gait analysis (OptoGait optical detection system) were assessed. Statistical analysis showed improvements after the intervention in the HIIT group compared with the MIIT and control groups regarding the fear of falling (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively), gait (both p < .05), and dynamic balance (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively), whereas both HIIT and MIIT groups improved balance confidence compared with the control group (p < .01 and p < .05, respectively). We can conclude that HIIT has significant beneficial effects of fall risk in older adults.
Anthropology	Background: Multiple 20th century studies have speculated on the anthropological similarities of the modern inhabitants of Greece with their ancient predecessors. The present investigation attempts to add to this knowledge by comparing the craniofacial configuration of 141 ancient (dating around 2,000-500 BC) and 240 modern Greek skulls (the largest material among relevant national studies). Method: Skulls were grouped in age at death, sex, era and geographical categories; lateral cephalograms were taken and 53 variables were measured and correlated statistically. The craniofacial measurements and measurements of the basic quadrilateral and cranial polygon were compared in various groups using basic statistical methods, one-way ANOVA and assessment of the correlation matrices. Observations: Most of the measurements for both sexes combined followed an akin pattern in ancient and modern Greek skulls. Moreover, sketching and comparing the outline of the skull and upper face, we observed a clock-wise movement. The present study confirms that the morphological pattern of Greek skulls, as it changed during thousands of years, kept some characteristics unchanged, with others undergoing logical modifications. Conclusion: The analysis of our results allows us to believe that the influence upon the craniofacial complex of the various known factors, including genetic or environmental alterations, is apt to alter its form to adapt to new conditions. Even though 4,000 years seems too narrow a span to provoke evolutionary insights using conventional geometric morphometrics, the full presentation of our results makes up a useful atlas of solid data. Interpreted with caution, the craniofacial morphology in modern and ancient Greeks indicates elements of ethnic group continuation within the unavoidable multicultural mixtures.
Demography	This article aims to identify if belonging to one side or another of the former Hapsburg Empire's border matters in relation to migration intentions. Based on a survey of 3,051 students enrolled at three Romanian universities, and using geo-referencing, data mining tools, logistic regressions and prediction nomograms, we found that students who have their homes in different parts, depending on this historical border, manifest different sensitivity levels towards recognition of their own value and the poor quality of public institutions and services, as they have different perceptions concerning the role of individual freedom, parental role models, the work ethic and interpersonal trust. These differences further generate opposite migration intentions for the two sub-samples. Therefore, students who have their homes in the former Empire's area have lower migration intentions than those outside it, despite their proximity to the western borders. The results suggest various economic and non-economic determinants as important predictors of migration intentions.
Business, Finance	Georgia-based Southwire staffed a plant with troubled teens, who proved that hard work can overcome hard knocks. In the process they pioneered a model for education reform nationwide.
Cultural Studies	In 2016, following the partial repeal of Catalonia's Cinema Act (Llei del Cinema, 2010), the 'Digital Levy' (taxa tecnologica, 2014) and the serious economic crisis, the Department of Culture of the Generalitat de Catalunya decided to subsidise dubbing and subtitling to ensure that Catalans could have access to films in their own language. This decision was taken with regard to new distribution platforms (VOD, Smart TV, etc.), film festivals and traditional exhibition formats. After three years in force, the combination of aid and bilateral agreements has proven to be effective for normalising access to audiovisual content in Catalan, encouraging diversity and exiting the legislative logjam that had, since 2010, been affecting public policy on the film industry in Catalonia. This article analyses the public policies, strategic plans, outcomes of agreements and production figures by means of case studies, data analysis, and in-depth interviews.
History Of Social Sciences	In India in 1901, a rare statistical event occurred. A confluence of interests gave a group of nascent planners new influence over the conduct of a census, with the result being a rich body of published information for Bombay and Calcutta. Useful in its day, this material now offers exceptional insights into social conditions, and the concerns of planners, in two great colonial cities. Having sketched the confluence of interests, this research note outlines the nature of the evidence that it produced and illustrates how it may be used by historical scholars, with particular reference to Bombay. The 1901 census can provide documentation of land use, living conditions, and the social geography of the city at a geographical scale that is finer than that of any other published census of the period.
Political Science	"The electoral success of the nationalist-chauvinist party Jobbik is a warning signal. Instead of distancing itself from Jobbik's actions and paramilitary henchmen Magyar Garda, the rightwing, conservative Civic Union (Fidesz) under Viktor ripen has brought itself into line with the rightwing extremists. Racist and anti-Semitic ideas are circulating. World-famous intellectuals, such as Imre Kertesz, Peter Nadas, Gyorgy Konrad, Peter Esterhazy, are pilloried as ""false Hungary."" Because the rightwing lacks a concept for the future, it falls back on the values and traditions of the prewar era: fascist Hungary. The new government is stirring fears among its neighbours with its policy on Hungarians abroad as well."
Law	"The law affects our behavior not only directly by imposing legal sanctions, but also indirectly, by providing information that shapes the reputations of individuals and organizations. This Article is the first to fully flesh out the reputation-shaping aspects of the law. The Article's first major contribution is in explaining how reputation works. Legal scholars are increasingly recognizing that reputation matters: reputational concerns are touted as an important factor that shapes our behavior across a wide range of phenomena, from product safety to corporate governance to international relations. Yet so far the literature has stayed remarkably silent on how exactly reputation matters. This Article draws from a fast-growing multidisciplinary body of reputation research to examine why similar behaviors lead to different reputational outcomes. A key takeaway is that reputational sanctions are much noisier than was previously acknowledged: the market systematically under-reacts to certain types of misbehaviors and over-reacts to others. The Article's second major contribution comes from mapping out the different ways in which the law affects reputational sanctions. Specifically, the Article focuses on the previously overlooked ""second-opinion role"" of the law. When bad news breaks about an adverse action by a company, market players react immediately by downgrading their beliefs about the company and their willingness to interact with it. But the same bad news may also get the legal system involved. Then, in the process of finding out whether to impose legal sanctions, the legal system produces as a byproduct information on the behavior of the parties to the dispute: what top managers knew and when they knew it, whether the adverse action was an isolated mistake or whether it is indicative of the company's operational culture, and so forth. This information reaches third parties, and makes them reassess their beliefs about the company. Contrary to the common assumption among legal scholars, law and reputation are not independent of each other, but rather complement each other. A well functioning legal system reduces noise and increases the accuracy of reputational sanctions. Acknowledging the informational role of the law generates important policy implications. First, the Article calls for a more cautious approach to scaling back legal intervention. If the law indeed complements non-legal sanctions, then any proposal to scale back legal intervention should also take into account the expected negative impact on non-legal deterrence. Second, the Article reassesses practical and timely debates such as the desirability of heightened pleading standards. If litigation indeed generates quality information on the behavior of market participants (a positive externality), then we should reevaluate key legal institutions according to how they contribute to information production."
Education & Educational Research	Amid debates about the continued salience of gender in mathematics; this report summarizes an IES-funded investigation of gender-related patterns in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Girls' and boys' mathematics achievement, confidence, and interest were examined, along with experiences at home and school. Mathematics performance gaps favoring boys appeared soon after children began kindergarten and then widened during elementary grades. Gender differences in mathematical confidence were larger than differences in both achievement and interest. Although boys' and girls' parent-reported home experiences differed in stereotypical ways, particularly among high-SES students, such differences appeared unrelated to gender gaps in mathematics outcomes. Teacher-reported instructional practices also shed little light on gender gaps in mathematics performance; however, teachers' perceptions of girls and boys could play a role.
Linguistics	This paper argues for and develops an ergative analysis of Tagalog. Determining whether a language is ergative or accusative is the result of examining the case marking alignment in transitive and intransitive clause types. However, identifying transitive and intransitive clauses has traditionally not been a straightforward task in work on Tagalog, which has been argued to possess two basic transitive clause types. Specifically, there is a long-standing controversy in Austronesian linguistics over whether the so-called 'actor focus' clause type is transitive or an antipassive. In this paper, I show that 'actor focus' clauses do in fact pattern with antipassives in uncontroversially ergative languages. This allows for the conclusion that Tagalog is an ergative language. In the analysis I propose, transitive v in ergative clauses values structural absolutive case with the object DP and assigns inherent ergative case to the external argument in its specifier. In intransitive (including antipassive) clauses, v is intransitive and accordingly has no case features to assign or value. The highest DP in vP values absolutive case with T, and the object in an antipassive is dependent on the lexical verb for inherent case. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Social Issues	Religious congregations hold a unique status among public charities in that they are exempt from having to ask for recognition of their tax-exempt status from the federal government. Despite this privileged status, more than two hundred thousand congregations are registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the rate of registration appears to be increasing. We examine regional, religious, and administrative patterns among the congregations registered with the IRS. Certain denominations, such as the Latter-day Saints, appear to have taken a centralized stance against congregational registration, whereas others, such as the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, have made a centralized decision for congregational registration. Other denominations appear to have left the decision up to individual congregations. Of those congregations that are registered, the method of registration, whether independent or through a denomination's group exemption, appears to be related to the denomination's centralization of authority.
Cultural Studies	In 2014, the Fenix Ibero-American Awards for Cinema and the PLATINO Awards for Ibero-American Cinema were launched. Created by Mexican and Spanish organizations respectively, both platforms aimed at promoting and disseminating contemporary Ibero-American cinema. This article analyses the strategies developed by these awards to conceptualize, market, and circulate Latin American, Portuguese, and Spanish cinemas in a global scenario. As such, the essay understands these initiatives as attempts to organize the cultural and economic domain of current Ibero-American cinemas. Specifically, our research dissects the different elements that constitute both prizes, from the creation of the statuettes to the selection of the films in competition and the broadcasting of the awards ceremonies. This close examination of how the Fenix and the PLATINO construct their symbolic power reveals how they mobilize and weave Ibero-American cinemas, regional and national identities, and city branding. Finally, the article questions the possibilities and limitations of these experiences as ways of developing economic and social discourses from and about Ibero-America.
Substance Abuse	Aims: Test-purchasing (using volunteers to attempt an apparent under-age purchase) can be used as an enforcement intervention against retailers who sell alcohol to minors. This article will investigate whether community shopkeepers, familiar with alcohol test-purchasing protocols, are able to distinguish volunteers from genuine under-age customers. Methods: Thirty-six qualitative interviews were conducted with community shopkeepers, the retailers most often associated with under-age sales, working in convenience stores located in socially-contrasting areas of Glasgow, Scotland, 24 of which were licensed to sell alcohol. Findings: Interviewees provided details of the strategies they used to prevent under-age sales. Robust age-verification, set 7.5 above legal-age of purchase, was felt to be particularly effective. Although, they were apprehensive of test-purchases, experienced retailers reported that they always knew when one was taking place in their shop, because volunteers were not sourced locally and, in contrast to real under-age customers, they were honest and compliant. Conclusions: Although making retailers more aware of their responsibilities, increased familiarity with the protocols of test-purchasing can allow vendors to be certain who real under-age customers are, potentially making low-risk sales to minors possible. Test-purchasing protocols (e. g. volunteers ages) should be re-oriented to keep pace with more robust age-verification checks.
Area Studies	"Drawing on ethnographic data from the sanitation industry in Wenzhou and Guangzhou, we investigate different patterns of work organization in each city. We find that supplementary informal work can serve to subsidize low family income and therefore stabilize formal but exploitative work. In Wenzhou, the family team model creates time and space for one spouse to engage in informal work while still receiving a wage from the employer. This additional informal work significantly increases net family income, which neutralizes worker demands for better wages and working conditions in the formal sector. In contrast, Guangzhou workers are subject to relatively rigid spatio-temporal controls, impeding them from participating in informal work to supplement their formal wages. Despite receiving higher wages and more benefits, these workers are highly wage dependent and express much greater discontent than their equivalents in Wenzhou. Theoretically, we contribute to the literature on informality through a discussion of ""ancillary informal work,"" highlighting how access to certain kinds of informal work both subsidizes and is facilitated by formal sector employment."
Public Administration	Pragmatism has become a topic of growing discussion in public administration, as demonstrated by ongoing debate within the pages of Administration & Society. Karen Evans recently argued that the pervasive influence of logical positivism has produced a public administration, dominated by an ethically vacuous overemphasis on efficiency. Keith Snider recently responded to Evans by pointing toward confusion arising from debates between competing varieties of pragmatism, arguing that calls for pragmatism may produce unintended consequences under the present paradigm. However, this debate has the potential to produce a more intellectually experienced and mature public administration. Moreover, American pragmatism is uniquely appropriate as a philosophy of public administration in its dual academic/practitioner roles.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose - Extant literature resoundingly praises Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) programs for the multitude of benefits they provide for law enforcement agencies and individuals with mental illnesses. The majority of CIT research is based on perceived benefits of this approach. Most of the goals of CIT programs are readily amenable to empirical study, yet there are few outcome evaluations of the programs. The purpose of this paper is to examine why empirical studies examining the effectiveness of CIT programs are nominal. Design/methodology/approach - Structural and practical impediments to the collection of empirical data for CIT programs were identified through including examinations of the types of data routinely collected, interviews with CIT participants, and the researchers' own observations of hindrances to the data collection processes. By triangulating these methods, the authors were able to observe a number of impediments to the collection of empirical data on this topic. Findings - The multi-jurisdictional CIT program under review had several data problems. First, there was a lack of official data concerning CIT calls. Second, it was virtually impossible to follow a person with mental illness throughout the system from first contact to final disposition. Third, data sharing was hindered by a lack of memorandums of understanding. Fourth, important information was not being properly recorded. Originality/value - This manuscript provides recommendations to address data concerns for CIT evaluations. Suggestions are intended to help facilitate more robust data for analysis and evaluation purposes, helping to grow the literature on the effectiveness and efficiency of CIT programs.
Transportation	The virtual disappearance of liner shipping conferences from US markets and their elimination in European trades create a significant risk that in place of these collusive price-setting groups, the industry could become increasingly consolidated. The absence of the conference pricing cushion could end up giving an advantage to large, cost-efficient carriers who will drive smaller players from the market. During this competitive process, shippers could see lower freight rates and better service but as the industry consolidates towards oligopoly, there is the risk that shippers will be faced with fewer alternatives to move their goods, lower service quality and significantly higher prices. The impact on merchandise trade could be substantial. This paper is intended to reveal basic structural characteristics of the liner shipping industry that could point to more accurate predictions of future consolidation activity. In particular, a series of mergers and acquisitions in the industry will be examined against the backdrop of industry structure and regulatory constraints. Ultimately, a Poisson model is formulated and estimated to extract and quantify the structural factors that increase the likelihood of horizontal merger and acquisition activity.
Public Administration	This article reviews recent conceptual debates on cross-national and cross-sectoral policy-learning in the political science literature. It proceeds from the argument that the existing literature is characterised by the absence of a comparative assessment of the risks and potentials of different strategies of policy learning. This sin of omission does not only have significant implications for the study of policy learning but also for its practice. The authors use the normative concept of improvement-oriented learning to assess the risks and potentials of three learning strategies: imitation, Bayesian updating and deliberation. They observe that the distribution of risks and potentials is most advantageous in deliberative learning strategies, but that imitation is the most risky learning strategy, and Bayesian updating ranges somewhere in-between.
History & Philosophy Of Science	For several decades now philosophers have discussed apparent examples of internally inconsistent scientific theories. However, there is still much controversy over how exactly we should conceive of scientific theories in the first place. Here I argue for a new approach, whereby all of the truly important questions about inconsistency in science can be asked and answered without disagreements about theories and theory-content getting in the way. Three examples commonly described as 'internally inconsistent theories' are analysed in the light of this approach. In the process, the question 'Is the theory inconsistent or not?' is identified as a bad, or at least unimportant, question.
Anthropology	The archaeological record has documented Oldowan hominin occupation of habitats ranging from open grasslands to riparian forest by 2.0 Ma. Despite this we have a poor understanding of whether hominin foraging behavior varied in different environmental settings. We compared bovid mortality profiles from the two largest Oldowan zooarchaeological samples, one from a grassland (Excavation 1, Kanjera South, Kenya) and another from a woodland (FLK Zinj, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) with bovid mortality samples created by African carnivores in different habitats. Kanjera hominins frequently had early access, likely through hunting, to small (size 1 <= 23 kg and size 2 = 24-112 kg) juvenile bovids, creating a mortality pattern similar to that created by grassland dwelling carnivores. Kanjera hominins had more mixed access to large (size 3 = 113-340 kg), often juvenile, bovids and frequently scavenged heads. In contrast, previous work has shown that the few small bovids at FLK-Zinj were predominantly older individuals. Prime adults dominated the FLK-Zinj large bovid sample, leading to a mortality pattern similar to that created by carnivores occupying more closed habitats. Variation in bovid body size and mortality profiles between these archaeological assemblages may reflect the challenges of acquiring fauna in open versus closed habitats with a simple hunting toolkit. The heterogeneous woodland habitat of FLK-Zinj would have provided more opportunities to ambush prey, whereas on grasslands with more limited concealment opportunities Kanjera hominins focused their efforts on vulnerable juvenile prey, some likely acquired after short chases.

Ethnic Studies	We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media, asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several countries, can be found pictures of 'sexual misery'. These 'frame' Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further. In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual lives of Muslims without simply idealising its subjects. This takes us to the journalism, life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts.
Criminology & Penology	This paper engages with literatures on democratic policing in established and emerging democracies and argues for disaggregating democratic policing into two more precise terms: policing for democracy and democratically responsive policing. The first term captures the contribution of police to securing and maintaining wider democratic forms of government, while the second draws on political theory to emphasize arrangements for governing police actors based on responsiveness. Applying two distinct terms helps to highlight limitations to external police assistance. The terms are applied in an exploratory case study of 15 years of police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The paper highlights early work securing the necessary conditions for political democracy in BiH but argues that subsequent interventions dominated by the European Union undermine responsiveness. A recent United Nations Development Programme project suggests that external actors can succeed in supporting democratically responsive policing where they do not have immediate security interests at stake.
Geography	This article aims to show how evolutionary theory, social-metabolism and sociological systems theory can be utilized to develop a concept of societynature coevolution. The article begins with a conception of industrialization as a socio-metabolic transition, that is, a major transformation in the energetic and consequently material basis of society. This transition to industrial metabolism was essential for the emergence and maintenance of industrial societies and is at the same time the main cause of global environmental change. The article proceeds by asking what the notion of societynature coevolution can potentially contribute to understanding environmental sustainability problems. An elaborated concept of coevolution hinges on (1) a more precise and sociologically more meaningful concept of cultural evolution and (2) understanding how cultural evolution is linked to the environment. Next I briefly outline major lines of thought and controversies surrounding the idea of cultural evolution. The direction proposed here commences with an abstract version of Darwinian evolution, which is then re-specified for social systems, understood as communication systems, as developed by Luhmann. The re-specification implies three important changes in the theoretical outline of cultural evolution: first, shifting from the human population to the communication system as the unit of cultural evolution and to single communications as the unit of cultural variation; second, shifting from transmission or inheritance to reproduction as necessary condition for evolution; and third, shifting from purely internal (communicative) forces of selection towards including also environmental selection. Adopting elements from the work of Hagerstrand and Boserup, the primary environmental selective force in cultural evolution is conceptualized as the historically variable constraints in human timespace occupation. In the conclusions I tie the argument back to its beginning, by arguing that the most radical changes in human timespace occupation have been enabled by major socio-metabolic transitions in the energy system.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Drawing on the transactional theory of stress, a research model investigating whether challenge stressors, as manifested by work overload and job responsibility, heighten work engagement and organizationally valued job outcomes is proposed and tested. Using data gathered from frontline employees with a time lag of two weeks and their supervisors in the five-star hotels in Northern Cyprus, the relationships were assessed through structural equation modeling. As hypothesized, work engagement fully mediates the effects of challenge stressors on affective organizational commitment and job performance. Employees who experience such stressors are engaged in their work, and therefore, display positive job outcomes. Theoretical implications as well as management implications are discussed in the article. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Substance Abuse	A major concern associated with misuse and abuse of drugs is the potential for overdose. This study is aimed at evaluating, over a 1-year period, drug-related overdoses (those involving prescription and non-prescription drugs) that have led to patients presenting at three major emergency departments in Amman. A data collection sheet was designed to capture the information required from the emergency records in each hospital. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 20). A total of 788 patients were admitted to the emergency departments with acute drug overdoses using 135 different kinds of drugs. The female-to male ratio was 1.7:1. The highest incidence of drug overdoses was in children 5 years old and younger (49%). Paracetamol was the most common drug involved in overdoses (14%), followed by ibuprofen (6.7%), diclofenac (4%), and amoxicillin (4%). It is recognized that overdose is among the most frequent reasons for visits to emergency departments. Regulations, appropriate post-marketing vigilance, and higher awareness of drugs misuse and abuse potentials which could lead to overdose are recommended for medical prescribers, pharmacists, and the public.
Social Issues	This paper investigates the how the volunteering behaviors of family and household members influence an individual's decision to volunteer. Using data from the 2005 Current Population Survey's Volunteering Supplement, I test how living with volunteers and living with people who have never volunteered affect volunteering. I find that living with volunteers dramatically increases the likelihood of volunteering, especially for religious volunteering. The more volunteers the person lives with, the higher the person's probability of volunteering. People who live with others who say that they have never volunteered in their lives are much less likely to volunteer and volunteer fewer hours. Living with volunteers also changes the methods by which people become involved in volunteering.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Biophilic design encourages the use of natural systems and processes in the design of the built environment. By introducing biophilic elements to a hotel's physical environment, a guest's need for connection with nature may be fulfilled. There is a lack of studies on the effect of biophilic design in the lodging industry. The purpose of this study is to examine whether implementing biophilic design enhances guest emotional responses, perceived quality, and behavioral intentions in the context of hotels. Using the scenario-based experiment, the findings of this study have revealed that biophilic designs elicited stronger positive emotional and behavioral responses than the standard design. In addition, customers perceived hotels that had biophilic designs as being superior in quality. While stakeholders within the lodging industry continue to plan, build, change, and control a hotel's atmospheric design, this study shows hoteliers some of the direct links between biophilic designs and guest responses.
Social Work	The care and protection of children are a concern that crosses ethnic, religious and national boundaries. How communities act on these concerns are informed by cultural and religious understandings of childhood and protection. Islam has specific teachings that relate to the care and guardianship of children and are interpreted in diverse ways across the Muslim world. Islamic teachings on child-care mostly overlap with Western understandings of child protection, but there can be some contested positions. This creates complexities for social workers intervening in Muslim communities where the basis of their intervention is primarily informed by a non-Muslim paradigm or occurs in secular legal contexts. The purpose of this article is to address at a broad level the issue of how overarching concepts of child protection and Islam influence social work practice with Muslim communities. It addresses a gap in practical applications of the synergy of Islamic thinking with core social work practice in the field of child protection. For effective practice, it is argued that social work practitioners need to consider common ground in Islamic thinking on child protection rather than rely on Western frameworks. This requires further research to build evidence-based practice with Muslim families.
Transportation	Car-following models replicate the behavior of a driver following another vehicle and are widely used in the development of traffic simulation tools. In this study, the performance of major car-following models is evaluated using microscopic vehicle trajectory when the lead and the following vehicle-types are different. Vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers were used to collect car-following data from two urban arterials of India. Analysis of car-following data indicates the existence of distinct behavior for each vehicle-type combination. Among the vehicle-type combinations studied, the following behavior of small sized vehicles is easily reproduced by the models, compared to large vehicle-types. Similarly, among the models, the Gipps and Krauss models are able to predict following behavior better than the rest followed by the MITSIM model.
History Of Social Sciences	"In 1929, the Lutheran mission at Hermannsburg (Ntaria), central Australia, became an extraordinary investigatory site, attracting an array of leading psychologists wishing to define the ""primitive"" mentality of the Arrernte, who became perhaps the most studied people in the British Empire and dominions. This is a story of how scientific knowledge derived from close encounters and fraught entanglements on the borderlands of the settler state. The investigators-Stanley D. Porteus, H. K. Fry, and Geza Roheim-represent the major styles of psychological inquiry in the early-twentieth century, and count among the vanguard of those dismantling rigid racial typologies and fixed hierarchies of human mentality. They wanted to evaluate ""how natives think,"" yet inescapably they found themselves reflecting on white mentality too. They came to recognise the primitive as an influential and disturbing motif within the civilised mind-their own minds. These intense interactions in the central deserts show us how Aboriginal thinking could make whites think again about themselves-and forget, for a moment, that many of their research subjects were starving.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Accounts of illness have been explored for their significance, purposes and consequences. There have been relatively few papers exploring the sources of accounts of illness and even fewer that have adopted a structural approach to these sources. This article draws on a secondary analysis of existing data to argue that social systems theory may provide a promising way to explore the structural aspects of illness accounts. This article takes the example of accounts of illness of dentine sensitivity, a condition that can have a range of impacts from relatively minor to significant on the everyday lives of people. The analysis involved a staged study of the factual, social and temporal dimensions of sensitivity including seeking out the social semantics that condition accounts of dentine sensitivity. The results of the study include a secondary analysis of data taken from interviews with 23 adults, 15 of whom were women and eight were men. Participants included those who were currently experiencing sensitivity in their teeth and who were adults of all ages (18-65 years) and backgrounds. The subsequent analysis presented in this article seeks to highlight how accounts of the impact of dentine sensitivity have a 'polyphonic' character. By this, we mean they have multiple structural sources. Accounts of dentine sensitivity are conditioned by the imperative of dentine sensitivity. This imperative involves a paradox that people should be insensitive to their sensitivity. A consequence of this is that people frequently suffer significant disruptive impacts from their sensitivity but must suffer these impacts alone. In addition to the imperative, we find that dentine sensitivity is a non-problem problem. This means that it is not a problem for health care organisations and as such individuals must use individualised solutions to the problem either through avoidance or by consuming specific toothpastes. Finally, dentine sensitivity has an important moral component; it can result from relative oral. 'neglect' or paradoxically too much care. In each communication we attempt to show how the semantics of dentine sensitivity are shaped by polyphonic horizons of communication (social, factual and temporal dimensions) and the participation of various communication systems (culture, the medical system and morality). The article concludes by discussing the usefulness of systems theory in understanding accounts of illness as a polyphonic unity of different horizons of communication alongside the influence of various system semantics.

Business	Studies on why small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engage in pro-environmental behavior suggest that managers' environmental responsibility plays a relatively greater role than competitiveness and legitimacy-seeking. These categories of drivers are mostly considered independent of each other. Using survey data and comparative case studies of wine firms in South Africa, this study finds that managers' environmental responsibility is indeed the key driver in a context where state regulation hardly plays any role in regulating dispersed, rural firms. However, especially proactive firms are also characterized by expectations of competitiveness gains. The authors thus emphasize the role of institutional context and potential interaction effects between these drivers in explaining the reasons why SMEs engage in pro-environmental behavior in developing countries.
Ethics	"Bainbridge's well known ""Ironies of Automation"" (in: Johannsen, Rijnsdorp (eds) Analysis, design and evaluation of man-machine systems. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 129-135, 1983. 10.1016/B978-0-08-029348-6.50026-9) laid out a set of fundamental criticisms surrounding the promises of automation that, even 30 years later, remain both relevant and, in many cases, intractable. Similarly, a set of ironies in technologies for sensor driven self-quantification (often referred to broadly as wearables) is laid out here, spanning from instrumental problems in human factors design (such as disagreement over physiological norms) to much broader social problems (such as loss of freedom). As with automation, these ironies stand in the way of many of the promised benefits of these wearable technologies. It is argued here that without addressing these ironies now, the promises of wearables may not come to fruition, and instead users may experience outcomes that are opposite to those which the designers seek to afford, or, at the very least, those which consumers believe they are being offered. This paper describes four key ironies of sensor driven self-quantification: (1) know more, know better versus no more, no better; (2) greater self-control versus greater social control; (3) well-being versus never being well enough; (4) more choice versus erosion of choice."
Gerontology	"Background/ObjectivesDelirium is underrecognized in clinical practice. The primary aim of the present multicenter study was to compare the ability of nurses to identify delirium features with a standardized assessment. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of missed or incorrect identifications of delirium by nurses. DesignPoint prevalence study in 120 wards across Italy. SettingDelirium Day 2015. ParticipantsInpatients aged 65 and older (N = 1,867). MeasurementsParticipants and nurses were asked specific questions to investigate their perceptions of the presence of delirium features (acute cognitive change, inattention, cognitive fluctuations, impaired arousal). Delirium was identified according to the results of the Assessment Test for Delirium and Cognitive Impairment (4AT), completed by a physician. Comorbidities including dementia, disability, drug treatments, and delirium motor subtype according to the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale were recorded. ResultsDelirium was present in 429 subjects (23%) according to the 4AT. Cognitive fluctuations was the delirium feature that the nurses most often recognized. Nurses"" perceptions of acute cognitive change, cognitive fluctuations, or impaired arousal had 84% sensitivity and 81% specificity for delirium. The nonmotor subtype of delirium was less likely to be recognized (80%) than the hyperactive (97%), mixed (92%), and hypoactive (90%) subtypes. Incorrect perception of delirium was more frequent in subjects with dementia (specificity 64%). ConclusionsThe delirium feature that nurses were best able to recognize was cognitive fluctuations. The nonmotor subtype was associated with a lower recognition rate. Routine observation and registration of delirium features by nurses in clinical practice might be helpful to increase formal diagnosis of delirium."
Criminology & Penology	Manga, a type of graphic novel, represent a widely popular literary genre worldwide and are one of the fastest growing areas of the publishing arena aimed at adolescents in the United States. However, to our knowledge, there has been almost no empirical research examining content or effects of reading manga. This article consists of 2 studies. Study 1 represents a content analysis of aggressive behavior in best-selling manga aimed at adolescents. Results revealed that aggression was common and was often portrayed in ways that may influence subsequent behavior. Study 2 examined the relationship between reading manga and aggressive behavior in 223 adolescents. Manga readers were more physically aggressive than non-manga readers and also reported more peer relationships with lonely individuals and smaller groups. In addition, reading manga with particularly high levels of aggression was associated with physical aggression even after controlling for media violence exposure in other media. Implications regarding these findings are discussed.
Anthropology	Pleistocene water crossings, long thought to be an innovation ofHomo sapiens, may extend beyond our species to encompass Middle and Early PleistoceneHomo. However, it remains unclear how water crossings differed among hominin populations, the extent to whichHomo sapiensare uniquely flexible in these adaptive behaviors, and how the tempo and scale of water crossings played out in different regions. I apply the adaptive flexibility hypothesis, derived from cognitive ecology, to model the global data and address these questions. Water-crossing behaviors appear to have emerged among different regional hominin populations in similar ecologies, initially representing nonstrategic range expansion. However, an increasing readiness to form connections with novel environments allowed someH. sapienspopulations to eventually push water crossings to new extremes, moving out of sight of land, making return crossings to maintain social ties and build viable founder populations, and dramatically shifting subsistence and lithic provisioning strategies to meet the challenges of variable ecological settings.
Ethnic Studies	The most memorable feature of the civil rights movement in the United States was its public demonstrations, especially the violent ones during which non-violent protesters clashed with Southern authorities. That these demonstrations, when viewed on televisions or in photographs, excited intense national interest is both obvious and well documented. What remains largely unexamined is the deeper cultural context for these events. Kuryla argues that two forms of public ritual explain their impact best. The first is the vigilante lynching, which activists symbolically reversed and revived for public scrutiny over twenty years after spectacle lynchings had become a thing of the past in the South. The second is the courtroom melodrama, whether in film or fiction, which Americans consumed at a colossal rate during the years of some of the most violent conflicts of the civil rights era. Using more traditional historical sources, along with works of film and fictionincluding Ralph Ellison's short story 'A Party Down at the Square', the Stanley Kramer film Judgment at Nuremberg and Harper Lee's novel To Kill a MockingbirdKuryla examines this phenomenon in more detail. Non-violent direct action, when mediated by sympathetic press coverage of the demonstrations, revisited the spectacle lynchings of the Southern past, inviting public shame, outrage and fascination. At the same time, the shock and immediacy of those events increasingly faded as many Americans and the media came to imagine the civil rights era within the often platitudinous moral universe of the courtroom melodrama. In the end, the space of the courtroom became culturally mapped on to the town squares and streets of the demonstrations, disciplining the radical political and philosophical potential of the non-violent protest. In courtrooms, reconciliation was much more assured, and the racial drama was mitigated by the tighter controls of an explicitly regulated, if artificial environment.
Development Studies	Marxist studies of imperialism have long focused on the role global finance plays in the reproduction of capital in the West through exploitation of the global South. While recent cultural studies of imperialism have pointed toward the nuanced microtechnologies used to cement international systems of power, there has been relatively little thought given to the role local financial systems play in American imperialism. Thus, in this paper I explore how micro-finance programs have been employed as a technology of government, and how the various practices that constitute recent shifts in rural banking create new forms of economic subjection within increasingly neo-liberal rule.
Economics	This paper tests two specific mechanisms through which individuals can form expectations about returns to investments in education: recognition for schooling performance, and exposure to successful students through family or social networks. Using a regression discontinuity design, we study the impact of two fellowship programs recognizing educational performance in secondary schools in India. We find that the fellowship award is associated with a significant increase in the perceived value of education, by both increasing the perceived mean of earnings (0.74 standard deviations (SD)) and decreasing the perceived variance in earnings (1.03 SD) associated with additional years of schooling. The effects spill over only selectively to social and family networks. Peers exposed to successful students do not update their beliefs but parents of fellows report higher perceived returns to education. Peers of fellows are however more informed about fellowship opportunities and report a higher intention to apply for the fellowship, thus contributing to the persistence of the potential impact of the fellowship across different cohorts.

Education, Special	The present study investigated the effects of online Community-based Instruction (CBI) training for pre-service special education teachers in Turkey. The training consisted of three knowledge modules and skill application assignments designed to be completed in 4 weeks. Results demonstrated statistically significant difference between control and treatment groups on CBI knowledge. Further, there were significant correlations between application assignment scores and post-assessment scores, as well as on time spent online and post-assessment scores. Maintenance data collected 3 months after the training showed that pre-service teacher participants' maintained their knowledge related to CBI over time. Limitations and future directions are discussed.
Geography	Research on the history of suburbs tends to either disregard the fringe of urban development or locate it beyond the city limits. In this article I argue that compounding fringe and suburban development misrepresents the real differences between the two. I then examine the metropolitan regions of three major U.S. cities-Baltimore, Buffalo, and Saint Louis in 1880 for evidence of how they differed. A consistent difference emerged between the residents of the suburban districts of a city and those of the presumed location of the fringe.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"Pliny's Natural History has been traditionally considered as the unoriginal work of an uncritical compiler. This has also been held to be true of the ""biological"" books, especially when one compares them with the works of Aristotle, one of Pliny's main authorities in this domain. Aristotle's achievements would be remarkable, especially in the field of classification, of which the philosopher is traditionally celebrated as the scientific father. However, by carefully reading HN XXXII it is possible to find a certain ""taxonomic"" awareness as, for instance, the need for a more accurate nomenclature in order to distinguish some aquatic animals beyond the proliferation of different vernacular terms which is not to be found in the works of Aristotle. This, in a rather positivist way, may seem to anticipate Renaissance naturalists, but is in fact the consequence of both Pliny's encyclopedic project and contingent ethnobiological, linguistic and social factors.

Area Studies	Nuclear accidents and the radiation they release into the environment exceed human sensory perception and, ultimately, comprehension. Whereas sociological analyses of such catastrophes tend to emphasize the difficulties of risk management, writers of literary texts raise questions of meaning and narrative control. Spanning the period from 1987 to 2012, the disaster texts by Christa Wolf, Inka Parei, Yoko Tawada, and Elfriede Jelinek that are the focus of this essay explore the personal, political, linguistic, and historical complexities of such catastrophes. Expressing and acknowledging the helplessness of the subject, they offer narrative approaches to catastrophe beyond individual responses and responsibilities.
Rehabilitation	Undergraduate and graduate students enroll in rehabilitation counselor education programs with varying degrees of commitment to a career goal in the field. The career decision state (CDS) comprising certainty, satisfaction, and clarity is a snapshot of one's career goals. It is bidimensional, differentiates between undergraduate and graduate rehabilitation counseling students, and is associated with negative career thinking. Implications for using CDS in the form of a brief questionnaire, in student orientation and ongoing advising, and in future research are discussed.
Anthropology	Objectives Male height and health affect a diverse range of social and economic outcomes such as competition for resources and mates. Life history theory predicts that limited availability of bioenergetic resources curbs the development of central life history functions such as somatic growth, immunity, and investment in offspring. Although genetic factors are important determinants of height, other factors such as income level may affect the incidence of infections during ontogeny, thus having indirect effects on somatic growth. We tested whether growing up in families with a higher income positively affects height and immune function. Materials and Methods Seventy-three young Latvian men from various socioeconomic backgrounds were given a hepatitis B vaccine. Blood samples were subsequently collected to measure the antibodies produced in response to the vaccination. Tweedie compound Poisson generalized linear models were used to examine relationships between height, family income, and antibody titers. Results Both height and family income positively correlated with the strength of men's immune response. However, when testing for the simultaneous effects of height and income on antibody titers, the statistical models showed that height affected antibody levels indirectly because income level mediated variance in height. Discussion The results of this study show that the relationships between height and immune function in young men are more complex than previously thought. Associations between taller stature of men and the robustness of their immune response are indirect because resource availability affects both somatic growth and the development of the immune system.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	In the summer of 2015, I lost my relationship (of four years) and then my Grandmother passed away, one after the other. Judith Butler says there is no ready vocabulary to describe the bonds by which one is connected to another, the ties by which we are differentiated and related. Those ties constitute what we are, they compose us. This is an autoethnographic bricolage that examines those affective bonds that stand revealed when you lose someone. Pain results from their being severed, but as Butler points out, grief is also transformative. I argue that performance (auto)ethnography is perfectly sited to examine these affects because it can evoke that which remains unlanguaged.
Linguistics	In Henry V, the use of French by the French characters serves a purpose beyond the mere characterisation of them as French. This is something that has not been fully acknowledged by critics to date. This article demonstrates first the singularity of non-English characters actually speaking in a different tongue in Shakespeare's plays, and the way in which the text draws attention to such speech. Three crucial scenes are examined in which, unable to communicate semantically as full human beings, the French speakers are not only represented as vulnerable in their relationship to the English-speaking characters, but made so in relation to the Anglophone audience. These scenes are used to illustrate how foreign language operates dramaturgically to privilege the physicality of speech, thereby emphasising the bodily reality of the character/actor. The sexual implications of this in two of these scenes, and their echo of England's conquering of France, is also discussed. Because it is the act of speaking a largely incomprehensible language that draws attention to this physically-based vulnerability, the full resonance of larger themes of the play related to mortality, dominance, and nationhood can therefore be realised fully only in performance.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: To analyze whether World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 can be used as an objective assessment tool for predicting the return-to-work status of working-age patients with stroke. Method: We obtained the data on 2963 patients disabled by stroke (age <60 years) from the Taiwan Data Bank of Persons with Disability for the July 2012-January 2014 period. Of these patients, 119 could return to work, whereas 2844 could not. Demographic data and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 standardized scores of patients with stroke who could return to work and those who could not (return to work and nonreturn-to-work groups, respectively) were analyzed and compared using the chi-squared and independent Student's t-tests. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to investigate the prediction accuracy for the return-to-work status, and the optimal cutoff point was determined using the Youden index. Binary logistic regression was employed to determine the predictors of the return-to-work status of patients with stroke. Results: The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 scores in all domains were lower in the return-to-work group than in the nonreturn-to-work group. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed moderate accuracy for all domain-specific scores [area under the curve, 0.6-0.8] and good accuracy for the summary scores of World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (area under the curve, >0.8). Binary logistic regression revealed that younger age, less severe stroke and standardized World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 summary scores below the cutoff points were predictors of the return to work status of working-age patients disabled by stroke. Conclusions: World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 can be used as an objective assessment tool for predicting the return-to-work status of working-age patients disabled by stroke. This tool can aid in establishing rehabilitation strategies and goal-setting processes for the return-to-work of patients with stroke.
Geography	"The paper questions the pluralization of policing devices and security agents across the Johannesburg metropolitan area, which has been accelerated and actually encouraged by public policies in the post-apartheid period. Are the various security initiatives and networks coordinated in a metropolitan security ""system"" - the regulation of which would need to be analysed - or does their development lead to urban fragmentation? Based on an analysis of an extensive documentation of security services, as well as a series of interviews with involved (street level) actors. different dimensions of potential urban fragmentation linked to security are examined: spatial fragmentation, with the development of road closures and their contestation; financial fragmentation, emblematised by business improvement districts encouraged by the municipality; and political fragmentation, as reflected by the analysis of the broader security policy framework. The paper argues that although the integrated vision of Johannesburg's policing creates the basis for redistribution of resources and forms of policing regulation at a metropolitan level (in contrast with the apartheid period), the choice of neo-liberal urban policies, of which security strategies form a part, tends to encourage policing fragmentation, or in other words, the differential and unequal provision of security services according to place, income and rice.

Public Administration	The performance appraisal system for civil servants in China was developed following the establishment of the national civil servants system in 1994. Since the Civil Servant Law of the People's Republic of China was issued, the system has been rectified twice to clarify some technical issues. Although much progress has been made since 1994, the current system is far from successful in practical operation. To improve its implementation among government agencies, the Chinese performance appraisal system needs to address some challenging issues, including the following: better connection of the performance appraisal system with other human resource management (HRM) systems, consideration of the performance budget system, and improvement of appraisal technical activities.
Information Science & Library Science	In this work, we propose a research framework to help people summarize tourism information, such as popular tourist locations as well as their travel sequences (routes), for a previously unknown city from massive travel blog with the objective of providing users with better travel scheduling. To do this, we first crawl the massive travel blogs for a targeted city online. Then, we transfer the textual contents of these blogs to a series of word vectors to form the initial data source. Next, we implement the frequent pattern mining method on the data to identify the city's popular locations by their sequenced co-occurrences among the usual tourism activities, which can be visualized into a word network. Finally, we develop a max-confidence based method to detect travel routes from the network. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to the data from a blog web-site run by a Chinese online tourism service company. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently explore the popular travel information from massive data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Ethics	"This article begins the task of assessing polygamy as a moral ideal. The structure of traditional polygamy, in which only one central spouse may marry multiple partners, necessarily yields two inequalities. The central spouse has greater rights and expectations within each marriage and greater control over the wider family. However, two alternative structures for polygamy can remove these inequalities. In polyfidelity, each spouse marries every other spouse in the family. In ""molecular"" polygamy, any spouses may marry a new spouse outside the family. These new models of polygamy face additional difficulties, but they can be egalitarian in principle."
Education, Special	This investigation examined relationships among special education teachers' working conditions (e.g., classroom characteristics, administrative support), personal characteristics (e.g., experience, certification status, self-efficacy), instructional quality, and students with disabilities' reading achievement and behavioral outcomes. Data from the 2004-2005 administration of the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study were used. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the fit of models for five latent factors. Hybrid structural models were applied to test the hypothesis that working conditions would be positively associated with special education teachers' self-efficacy and their instructional quality, which would, in turn, be positively associated with their students' reading achievement and behavioral outcomes. Although the initial structural equation model tested failed to support the hypotheses, several significant relationships with theoretical and practical significance were discovered. Directions for future research and practical implications are discussed.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Mixed mode data collection designs are increasingly being adopted with the hope that they may reduce selection errors in single mode survey designs. Yet possible reductions in selection errors achieved by mixing modes may be offset by a potential increase in total survey error due to extra measurement error being introduced by the additional mode(s). Few studies have investigated this empirically, however. In the present study, we compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for a range of estimates using data from a mode comparison experiment. We compare two mixed mode designs (a sequential web plus mail survey, and a combined concurrent and sequential CATI plus mail survey) with a single mode mail survey. The availability of auxiliary data on the sampling frame allows us to estimate several components of MSE (sampling variance, non-coverage, nonresponse and measurement bias) for a number of sociodemographic and target variables. Overall, MSEs are lowest for the single mode survey, and highest for the CATI plus mail design, though this pattern is not consistent across all estimates. Mixing modes generally reduces total bias, but the relative contribution to total survey error from different sources varies by design and by variable type.
Social Issues	The impact of the global recession has served to increase resource pressures on voluntary organizations in many social service sectors, serving to constrain the choices that organizational leaders can make in the face of changing resource niches. Not all organizational leaders face the same set of viable choices in the face of both changing demands from funding bodies and highly dynamic resource niches. Drawing on theories of organizational change, it is possible to identify three key factors that will serve to limit the tactics that voluntary organizations can employ: niche-level dynamics, niche density, and the presence of organizational champions. These three factors are illustrated through an analysis of the effects of the economic recession in Northern Ireland on two subsectors: community development and youth-serving organizations. We conclude with a call for greater theoretical and empirical development of the resource niche as the appropriate unit of analysis.
Linguistics	The development of metapragmatic competence is directly proportional to the cognitive development of infants: as they become older, a linguistic maturation takes place and allows them to use the language resources to consciously produce certain effects or intentions in their speech, like humour. In this study, we focus our attention on certain morphological phenomena such as indicators or markers of humour in Spanish such as appreciative suffixation or lexicogenetic procedures used for word creation within a narrative discourse - previously indicated to be humorous-, written by boys and girls of 8 and 12 years of age. On the one hand, quantitative data on the use of these resources and their distribution by age and gender are analysed. On the other hand, it is observed if these morphological and lexical elements announce or entail humour.
Sociology	"Advocates and counselors who assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault often claim a moral identity that depends, in part, on their ability to sympathize with their clients. However, when their clients behave in ways that staff members perceive as ""difficult"" (i.e., lie, return to their abusers, break rules, express anger at those trying to help them, or fail to show up for appointments), feelings of sympathy can begin to wane-creating a moral identity dilemma. Data collected from participant observation and in-depth interviews outline four generic processes that advocates and counselors engage in to overcome this dilemma. These findings highlight the interdependent nature of identity and emotion management and contribute to previous scholarship on how those who claim a moral identity negotiate feelings that run counter to their identity code."
History	This introduction outlines the common themes of the five articles in this special section on the social histories of neoliberalism. It focuses particularly on questions of temporality, subjectivity, transnational networking, and unevenness.
Ethics	As rapid advances in nanotechnology are made, we must set guidelines to balance the interests of both human beneficiaries and the environment by combining nanoethics and environmental ethics. In this paper, I reject Leopoldian holism as a practical environmental ethic with which to gauge nanotechnologies because, as a nonanthropocentric ethic, it does not value the humans who will actually use the ethic. Weak anthropocentrism is suggested as a reasonable alternative to ethics without a substantial human interest, as it treats nonhuman interests as human interests. I also establish the precautionary principle as a useful situational guideline for decisionmakers. Finally, I examine existing and potential applications of nanotechnology, including water purification, agriculture, mining, energy, and pollutant removal, from the perspective of weak anthropocentrism using the precautionary principle.
Management	This article provides a new technique for quantitatively characterizing the progress of recovery operations in the aftermath of a disaster event. The approach extends previous research on measuring dynamic, or adaptive, disaster resilience by developing a robust approach for characterizing nonlinear disaster recovery. In doing so, it enables a more accurate mathematical representation of different categories of recovery behavior and provides support for a much broader application of existing theory. Because the new approach inherits the ability to compare the relative behavior of multiple scenarios simultaneously, it also can serve as the basis for analytically comparing the expected performance of different plans for recovery operations. Practical application of the technique is demonstrated and discussed in the context of recovering electrical power after Hurricane Sandy struck the New York metropolitan area.
Linguistics	"Learning French grammar spelling (GS) is particularly difcult for frst-and second-language students, including in Quebec. However, certain teaching practices, such as integrated approach and meta-cognitive dictations, have shown positive effects on students"" GS. In this study, we designed a teaching method inspired by these practices, integrating plurilingual pedagogy as well to include the bi/plurilingual profiles of students in French Quebec schools. We then tested a plurilingual method with Grade 7 students (n = 79) and compared its effects with those of a monolingual method (n = 70) and traditional GS teaching practices (n = 46). Using a dictation and a written production for pretest, immediate and delayed posttest, we found that both the plurilingual and monolingual methods contribute significantly more to the development of GS than traditional teaching practices, especially the plurilingual method over time."
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Given the current insatiable demand for coal to build and fuel the world's burgeoning cities the debate about mining-related social, environmental and health injustices remains eminently salient. Furthermore, the core issues appear universally consistent. This paper combines the theoretical base for defining these injustices with reports in the international health literature about the impact of coal mining on local communities. It explores and analyses mechanisms of coal mining related injustice, conflicting priorities and power asymmetries between political and industry interests versus inhabitants of mining communities, and asks what would be required for considerations of health to take precedence over wealth.

International Relations	Ever since the currency crisis of 1997-98, there has been a great deal of interest in enhancing regional economic cooperation in Asia. It is important to keep in mind that economic regionalism is of multidimensional nature. The focus of this paper is on policy initiatives underway in Asia to enhance monetary and financial regionalism and the analytical bases for these initiatives, rather than on examining the de facto level of financial and monetary links that already exists (which may or may not have been facilitated via regional policy mechanisms). There are many gradations of monetary and financial regionalism, ranging from the weak form involving regional policy dialog and surveillance, on the one hand, to exchange rate and monetary coordination, on the other. To maintain focus, this paper concentrates more narrowly on 'medium forms' of monetary and financial regionalism, broadly defined as the development of regional liquidity arrangements and regional financial markets.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Nonfarm employment continued to expand in 2015. Private service-providing industries accounted for the vast majority of job gains. Despite a slowdown in the overall rate of job growth in 2015, the gains were a continuation of an expansion that started in May 2014, when employment recovered to its previous peak level of January 2008.
Ethics	Izydora Dambska was one of the most outstanding representatives of the Lvov-Warsaw School and a disciple of both the School's founder Kazimierz Twardowski and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. Interest in the School was the result of Twardowski's program of scientific philosophy, which was adopted by the vast majority of his students. This program assumed that the basic condition for practicing philosophy in a scientific manner is the precise use of language by a philosopher. One of the scholars who devoted most attention to language was Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. Dambska accepted that the philosophical program of the School was opposed to the trend shared by many contemporary schools at the time which belonged to the so called current of linguistic philosophy. According to this trend, language is the only object of philosophical investigation. The analysis of Ajdukiewicz's concept of language is one of her most interesting achievements in the domain of philosophy of language. This concept, called by DA...mbska 'the immanent concept of language', is the basis of Ajdukiewicz's well-known radical conventionalism.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The derivation of estimators in a multi-phase calibration process requires a sequential computation of estimators and calibrated weights of previous phases in order to obtain those of later ones. Already after two phases of calibration the estimators and their variances involve calibration factors from both phases and the formulae become cumbersome and uninformative. As a consequence the literature so far deals mainly with two phases while three phases or more are rarely being considered. The analysis in some cases is ad-hoc for a specific design and no comprehensive methodology for constructing calibrated estimators, and more challengingly, estimating their variances in three or more phases was formed. We provide a closed form formula for the variance of multi-phase calibrated estimators that holds for any number of phases. By specifying a new presentation of multi-phase calibrated weights it is possible to construct calibrated estimators that have the form of multi-variate regression estimators which enables a computation of a consistent estimator for their variance. This new variance estimator is not only general for any number of phases but also has some favorable characteristics. A comparison to other estimators in the special case of two-phase calibration and another independent study for three phases are presented.
History	"During the late 1950s, trade unions came to be vital actors in the solidarity movements of the Global South, especially in pan-African initiatives. The case of the Union generale des travailleurs algeriens (UGTA) is particularly illustrative of this development. Algeria's long and brutal independence struggle was championed throughout the Afro-Asian bloc, and the UGTA became an important auxiliary in the bloc's campaigns to secure that end. In this essay, the case of Algeria and the UGTA serves as a prism through which to study how some of the most powerful Western trade union federations of the day-especially the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO)-responded to the ""subaltern"" internationalisms engendered by decolonization and the ""spirit of Bandung,"" whether in the guise of positive neutrality or the project for pan-African unity. In this way, this essay sheds new light on the nature and role of labor internationalism in the context of the global Cold War. The case of Algeria is emblematic of the ways in which decolonization and the ""spirit of Bandung"" came to challenge traditional understandings of labor internationalism, whether as an identity or a practice. What is more, the case of Algeria allows us to reconceptualize AFL-CIO attitudes and designs vis-a-vis the decolonizing world. In highlighting American weakness when confronted by non-Western agency, this essay argues that the polarized view of the federation as an anticommunist crusader with an imperialist agenda is flawed."
Education, Special	Two approaches to systematic word review were integrated into an 18-week program of extended vocabulary instruction with kindergarten students from three high-need urban schools. Words in the embedded and semantically related review conditions received systematic and distributed review. In the embedded review condition, brief word definitions were integrated into the narratives of multiple storybooks. In the semantically related review condition, in-depth word review with explicit emphasis on semantic features and associations was provided during extension activities. Systematic review resulted in an almost twofold increase in target word learning. Embedded review was effective and time efficient, whereas semantically related review was time intensive but resulted in higher levels of word learning. There was a significant gain in Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III standard scores following the intervention.
Health Policy & Services	Federally qualified health centers, also known as community health centers, play an essential role in providing health care to millions of Americans. In return for providing primary care to underserved, homeless, and migrant populations, these centers are reimbursed at a higher rate than other providers by public programs such as Medicaid. Under the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the role of the centers is expected to grow. To examine the quality of care that the centers provide, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing compared the use of costly hospital-related services by Medicaid clients whose usual source of care was a community health center with the use by clients whose usual source of care was a private, fee-for-service provider. The study found that community health center users were about one-third less likely than the other group to have emergency department visits, inpatient hospitalizations, or preventable hospital admissions. Public funders such as states should work with community health centers to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care even further.
Substance Abuse	Previous research showing that parents tend to underestimate adolescent substance use is consistent with concerns that adolescent substance use may develop because parents delay in reacting to it. However, little research has examined parental decisions regarding how and when to intervene on adolescent substance use. This study examines the actions that parents report they would take after (a) discovering substance use to intoxication and (b) when they believe their child has a substance use problem. Internet surveys were conducted asking parents (N = 975) how they would respond to (a) evidence of their child's use to intoxication and (b) their child's significant problem with either alcohol, cannabis, prescription opioids, or illicit drugs. While parental response to alcohol and cannabis intoxication focused on talking with their children (34% and 45%, respectively) and punishment (30% and 18%, respectively), parents were significantly more likely to report help-seeking behaviors when responding to prescription opioid or illicit drug use intoxication (37% and 30%, respectively). More effective public health initiatives are needed to provide parents with practical strategies to address adolescent substance use and to increase parental engagement in the services offered by addiction specialists.
Urban Studies	What explains local policy response to extreme events? This question takes on growing importance as climate change increases the frequency of droughts, floods, heat waves, wildfires, and severe storms. Emergency events like these often require local officials to make decisions that trade off short-term risk reduction against longer-term political costs. Policies that promote community-wide safety and resilience may face opposition because they restrict resource use or otherwise limit personal activities. Using data on the adoption of local water usage restrictions during the 2010-2013 Texas drought, we examine the balance between political and problem-driven incentives for local emergency response. We find that problem conditions and institutional capacity of water systems outweigh political interests in shaping the timing of policy response.
Management	Competitiveness today requires being able to operate at a global scale. The financial crisis invigorated this requirement, posing new challenges to the economic viability of conventional companies and demanding alternative organizational forms of production. Although a wealth of research has focused on capitalist companies, little attention has been paid to the way these challenges affected worker cooperatives. Drawing from a qualitative case study of the Mondragon Cooperative Group, this article discusses the obstacles to internationalization faced by worker cooperatives, as well as the specific conditions and implications involved. In particular, the article analyzes Mondragon's contradiction between being forced to expand and trying to keep cooperative values during this expansion. Two main actions aimed at responding to this contradiction are analyzed: the creation of mixed cooperatives and the extension of the corporate management model. The analysis of this process will shed light on actions for the global expansion of worker cooperatives.
Education & Educational Research	"Information and communications technology (ICT) shapes life and work in every educational system. Where to place ICT in the pedagogical process and how it affects students' psychosocial and cognitive abilities are questions that do not have one definitive answer. The research addresses the intense introduction of ICT that accords with educational trends and the requirements of today's society, but sometimes neglects social competences and any potential psychosocial effects. A need for new and effective methods in upbringing and education to offer everyone, equal opportunities become more and more important in the ""world of the 21st century"". The research also proved that innovative didactic methods of teaching (4.0) using a transdisciplinary model and supported by state-of-the-art information and communications technology as well as cooperative learning, have a positive psychosocial effect on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students. Students who experience innovative didactic teaching supported by ICT reach higher taxonomic, cognitive and social standards of competence and are thus better prepared for the challenges of future society."
Political Science	Recent scholarship of comparative authoritarianism suggests that party institutions contribute to regime resilience by facilitating power-sharing among the party elites and preventing the paramount leaders' abuse of power that undermines political stability. Existing studies tend to focus on the empirical association between party organizations and regime resilience, whereas the actual effects of institutions on elite behavior receive less attention. This paper conducts an in-depth study of China's appointment system to examine whether the CCP's power-sharing institutions indeed constrain the person- nel authority of the party's paramount leader. Using a unique dataset of provincial leadership appointment from 1992 to 2014, the empirical analysis reveals that the General Secretary enjoys what can be described as constrained supremacy' in the making of personnel decisions: the leader can boost his own position by providing favorable treatment to key supporters, but the formal arrangement of collective decision-making constrains rampant reward of patronage that would unsettle the balance among the regime's top elites. The findings of the paper lay bare the diffculty of capturing the inner workings of authoritarian politics with broad, cross-national indicators of regime type; they also illustrate the complicated interaction between formal institutions and informal, personal logic of exercising power in authoritarian regimes.
Management	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore different aggregate production planning (APP) strategies (inventory levelling, validation of the workforce and flexible production alternatives: overtime and/or outsourcing) by using a system dynamics model in a two-level, multi-product, multi-period manpower intensive supply chain (SC). Therefore, the appropriateness of using systems dynamics as a research method, by focusing on managerial applications, to analyse APP policies is proven. From the combination of systems dynamics and APP, recommendations and action strategies are considered for each scenario to understand how the system performs and to improve decision making on APP in the SC context. Design/methodology/approach - The research design analyses a typical factory setting with representative parameter settings for five different conventional APP policies - inventory levelling, workforce variation, overtime, outsourcing and a combination of overtime and outsourcing - through deterministic systems dynamics-based simulation. In order to validate the simulation model, the results from published APP models were replicated. Then, optimisation is conducted for this deterministic setting to determine the performance of all these typical policies with optimal parameter settings. Next, a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation is used to assess the robustness of such performances in a variety of demand settings. Different aggregate plans are tested and the effect that events like demand variability and production times have on the SC performance results is analysed. Findings - The results support the assertion that the greater the demand variability, the higher the flexibility costs (overtime, outsourcing, inventory levelling, and contracts and firings). As greater inter-month oscillations appear, which must be covered with additional alternatives, the optimum number of employees must be determined by analysing the interchanges and marginal costs between capacity oversizing costs (wages, idle time, storage) and the costs to undersize it (penalties for lowering safety stocks, delayed demand, greater use of overtime and outsourcing). Accordingly, controlling the times to avoid increased costs and penalties incurred by delayed demand becomes an essential important task, but one that also depends on the characteristics of this variability. Practical implications - This paper has developed a modelling approach for APP in a manpower intensive SC by applying system dynamics. It includes a simulation model, the analysis of several scenarios, the impact on performance caused by variability events in the parameters, and some recommendations and action strategies to be subsequently applied. The modelling methodology proposed can be employed to design-specific models for each SC. Originality/value - This paper proposes an APP system dynamics approach in a two-level, multi-product, multi-period manpower intensive SC for the first time. This model bridges the gap in the literature relating to simulation, specifically system dynamics and its application for APP. The paper also provides a qualitative description of the various pros and cons of each analysed policy and how they can be combined.
Criminology & Penology	This paper contributes to research on neighborhood effects and knowledge about the conditions associated with community-level patterns of police behavior by examining whether levels of violence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with officer-involved shootings in Houston, TX. In addition, drawing from the ecological theory of policing, this study explores whether spatial heterogeneity exists in the observed relationships. Poisson regression models reveal that community violence and neighborhood racial and ethnic context are meaningful indicators of on-duty officer-involved shootings. Socioeconomic disadvantage did not emerge as a significant variable in the models estimated. Results from Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models indicate statistically significant spatial variation in the effects for all the key community factors. The findings highlight the importance of local context for developing a greater understanding of police violence across the urban landscape.
International Relations	This article argues that mediation by special representatives of the Secretary-General (SRSGs) in civil wars involves a distinctly clear strategic purpose: by conducting international mediation and managing international assistance, SRSGs structure the incentives for parties in conflict to exchange the battlefield with a reformed, renewed, or created state. The article offers a substantive introduction to a special-focus section of this issue of Global Governance on the role of the SRSGs in mitigating civil wars. The introduction describes the often conflicted and multilayered role that these individuals play in managing the mediation process, serving as the principal for large-scale UN peacekeeping or political missions, in navigating within the Secretariat and in relation to the Security Council, and in coordinating on-the-ground a panoply of international organizations, regional organizations, donor agencies, and humanitarian or other nongovernmental organizations. The article concludes with three principal issues that consideration of SRSG roles in civil war termination raises: choice, context and conduct. In sum, for more effective leadership management of efforts to end civil wars, the roles and functions of the SRSGs need to become more institutionalized.
Demography	A qualitative study based on men from three generations in San Antero (Cordoba, Colombia), inquired for the forces that promoted chances on reproductive indicators and the masculine role in these transformations. The research describes sexual behavior patterns and how both the lack of sexual education and the lack of intergenerational communication become barriers to decision making on fertility in men from the region.
Information Science & Library Science	Role analysis plays an important role when exploring social media and knowledge-sharing platforms for designing marking strategies. However, current methods in role analysis have overlooked content generated by users (e.g., posts) in social media and hence focus more on user behavior analysis. The user-generated content is very important for characterizing users. In this paper, we propose a novel method which integrates both user behavior and posted content by users to identify roles in online social networks. The proposed method models a role as a joint distribution of Gaussian distribution and multinomial distribution, which represent user behavioral feature and content feature respectively. The proposed method can be used to determine the number of roles concerned automatically. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to identify various roles more effectively and to get more insights on such characteristics.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The purpose of this essay is to identify why history of science and philosophy of science have lost their former alliance. Reasons include, among others, structural elements in funding, e.g. a run-down version of interdisciplinarity that encourages philosophy and history to work with the sciences rather than with each other. Moreover, the disciplinary assemblage in terms of cultural studies (German: Kulturwissenschaften) has eroded the continental concept of 'Geisteswissenschaft' to which history and philosophy traditionally belong. In consequence, both disciplines face a loss of knowledge in historical terminologies and related inquiries. Above all, these matter for shaping and understanding concepts and ideas; not last for the conceptualization of history and philosophy of science themselves.
Environmental Studies	"The prospect of unprecedented environmental change, combined with increasing demand on limited resources, demands adaptive responses at multiple levels. In this article, we analyze different attributes of farm-level capacity in central Arizona, USA, in relation to farmers' responses to recent dynamism in commodity and land markets, and the institutional and social contexts of farmers' water and production portfolios. Irrigated agriculture is at the heart of the history and identity of the American Southwest, although the future of agriculture is now threatened by the prospect of ""mega-droughts,"" urbanization and associated inter-sector and inter-state competition over water in an era of climatic change. We use farm-level survey data, supplemented by in-depth interviews, to explore the cross-level dimensions of capacity in the agriculture-urban nexus of central Arizona. The surveyed farmers demonstrate an interest in learning, capacity for adaptive management and risk-taking attitudes consistent with emerging theory of capacity for land use and livelihood transformation. However, many respondents perceive their self-efficacy in the face of future climatic and hydrological change as uncertain. Our study suggests that the components of transformational capacity will necessarily need to go beyond the objective resources and cognitive capacities of individuals to incorporate ""linking"" capacities: the political and social attributes necessary for collective strategy formation to shape choice and opportunity in the future."
Industrial Relations & Labor	This paper utilizes establishment-level data to explore the impact of works councils on firm productivity in France. A variety of empirical techniques is employed, including fixed effects and regression discontinuity designs, to identify this impact. We estimate the works council effect on productivity in union and nonunion settings, and investigate the extent to which alternative forms of worker voice and information sharing might substitute for the works council's impact in production. We find no evidence of a positive impact of works councils on firm productivity in any of our results, and some limited evidence of a negative effect in some of the findings. There is no indication that estimated impacts on productivity vary with union status. However, a notable finding is that worker voice and information-sharing human resource practices are prevalent in French firms regardless of works council status, and are found to have positive and statistically significant effects on firm productivity.
Ethnic Studies	Writing about white middle-class queer subjectivities is a necessarily difficult task. Partly, this is because of ongoing debates over identity politics (and indeed post-identity politics), and partly because writing as a white middle-class queer always appears to invoke a particular 'yes but' ('yes I am white and middle-class but I am also queer'). In this article I outline one way of engaging in a white middle-class queer praxis that takes into account these two issues, and uses them as a starting place from which to think about the intersections of whiteness, queerness and class in potentially novel ways. Drawing on the work of Jodi Dean, I elaborate what I term a 'white middle-class queer post-identity politics identity politics' that centres issues of reciprocity and accountability by considering the role of others in the constitution of the self. Recognizing the fundamental indebtedness that arises from this represents one means through which to negotiate a speaking position as a white middle-class queer that evokes an altogether different 'yes but', one that is mindful of race and class privilege.
Geography	The increased ease for individuals to create, share and map geographic information combined with the need for timely, relevant and diverse information has resulted in a new disaster management context. Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geographic information voluntarily created by private citizens enabled through technologies like social media and web-based mapping, has changed the ways people create and use information for crisis events. Research has focussed on disaster response while largely ignoring prevention and preparedness. Preparing for disasters can reduce negative impacts on life and property, but despite strategies to educate communities, preparation remains low. This study assesses the application and value of VGI in bushfire risk reduction through a participatory mapping approach. It examines VGI as a social practice and not simply a data source by considering the user experience of contributing VGI and the potential for these activities to increase community connectedness for building disaster resilience. Participatory mapping workshops were held in bushfire-risk communities in Tasmania. Workshop activities included a paper-mapping exercise and web-based digital mapping. Survey results from 31 participants at three workshops indicated the process of mapping and contributing local information for bushfire preparation with other community members can contribute to increased social connectedness, understanding of local bushfire risk, and engagement in risk reduction. Local knowledge exchange was seen as valuable, but the social dimension appeared even more engaging than the specific information shared. Participants reported collaborative maps as effective for collating and sharing community bushfire information with a preference for digital mapping. Some limitations of online sharing of information were also reported by participants, however, including potential issues of privacy, data quality and source trustworthiness. Further work is needed to extrapolate findings from the study sample to the broader population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Criminology & Penology	In recent years, sharp increases in the female prison population have landed more mothers behind bars. While the experiences of imprisoned women may differ substantially from free mothers, studies suggest that motherhood is important for many imprisoned mothers. The current study uses a sample of 210 imprisoned mothers and multivariate modeling to investigate how familial relationships before and during imprisonment and mothers' postrelease expectations influence the salience of maternal identity. Findings suggest that regardless of demographic factors, close mother-caregiver relationships, contact with family during imprisonment, and expecting to have custody of children upon release positively impacts imprisoned women's mothering identities.
Area Studies	Violent political conflict results in socioeconomic fragmentation and hampers economic development. In contrast, trade crucially depends on cooperation. The article empirically analyses at the micro-level whether economic interactions affect political attitudes. Trading relations between Israelis and Palestinians are found to be extensive despite the conflict. Education and personal social networks facilitate contacts. Israeli traders do not see themselves as affected by the conflict, but wish for its quick settlement. This lends support to the Rational Group Conflict Theory and the Theory of Liberal Peace. Daily contacts are found to create positive functional interdependence which may be effective in fostering reconciliation in the Middle East.
Environmental Studies	Like the Stern Review the IPCC Working Group 3 Reports have been taken as showing that the greenhouse gas emissions problem can be solved at negligible cost, primarily by development of alternative energy technologies. The lengthy Fourth Assessment Report summarises the findings of many studies, rather than present analyses that can be clearly assessed. The argument in this paper is that most and probably all of the studies drawing conclusions about the mitigation potential of alternatives are invalid because they do not consider the possible limitations to renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and geo-sequestration. They are economic modelling studies which take the cost of a unit of carbon mitigation and multiply this by the amount of mitigation required, without regard to the difficulties and limits affecting the extent to which these sources can be scaled up. If the greenhouse problem is to be solved by resort to these technologies then the magnitude of the scale-ability problem is huge. This paper argues that there are major reasons why the alternatives cannot be scaled up sufficiently, and that it is not possible to explain how the anticipated 2050 energy budget could be met without exceeding safe greenhouse limits. If this analysis is sound Stern and the IPCC have been seriously misleading and the greenhouse problem cannot be solved at any cost in a society that is committed to affluent living standards and economic growth. The discussion accepts the climate science in both sources, and does not dispute the desirability of moving to renewable energy.
Linguistics	The joint force of social media and marketization has transformed university communication in terms of style, discourse structure, and communicative purpose. To understand its new features in comparison with print media, this paper analyzes a corpus of universities' recruitment posts on WeChat in China. Using the method of genre analysis, the study identifies 8 moves which serve 5 different communicative functions. Each move is analyzed in terms of its salient semantic features and linguistic/visual strategies of realization. Analysis shows that WeChat recruitment posts are characterized by (1) an interdiscursive mix of a wider range of communicative functions, particularly the coexistence of policy discourse and promotional discourse, (2) sophisticated hierarchies of talents wanted and highlighted remuneration information, (3) the use of personalized language and multimodal resources such as photographs and tables to engage readers' interest and to build solidarity. The new features are then discussed critically in relation to the ongoing 'recruitment hype' in China and the affordances of WeChat. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Political Science	What effect do online public consultations have on legislative duration in the European Union? While scholars are divided on whether consultations speed things up or slow things down, they agree that consultations affect how decision-makers think about legislative proposals. I argue that this is only part of the story: the impact of consultations on legislation duration is also a function of the administrative capacity of decision-makers and their staff to process consultation submissions. I test this argument using a unique data set of over 750 legislative proposals in the period 2009-2013. I find that consultations tend to have a negative impact on the time it takes to pass legislation. However, this negative effect is less pronounced when decision-makers have sufficient administrative capacity to process submissions.
Sociology	"Despite decades of policy aimed at the maintenance of Francophone communities in Ontario, the proportion of individuals with French as a mother tongue or who speak French most often at home has steadily declined. Research on language retention has highlighted the importance of sociodemographic and structural factors in understanding minority language practices. However, given the relationship between culture and action, this paper examines how cultural factors contribute to Franco-Ontarians' linguistic practices. Results indicate that beyond couple composition and the concentration of minority-language speakers, cultural factors including identity, cultural consumption, and values play an instrumental role in Franco-Ontarians' linguistic continuity. The importance of considering linguistic continuity as part of a ""package"" of cultural practices is discussed."
Women'S Studies	New materialist feminists have long agonised over the constituents of biological 'life' or 'living' material, by proposing and pursuing questions of ontology: 'What is matter? What is life? How do they link together [?]' ([Grosz, Elizabeth. 2004. The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution and the Untimely. Crows Nest, N.S.W: Allen & Unwin], 17). But in favouring such ontological inquiry, the new materialists have neglected consideration of the very constructedness of this 'life' category. To add historical perspective to this debate, this article demonstrates that 'life' and 'matter' and the way they 'link together' are necessarily historical questions, too. These are concepts which are known and experienced differently through time, and I suggest that 'life' can only be known once its historicity and contingency is unpacked. To advance this argument, I conduct a close reading of the experimental records of a leading nineteenth-century French physiologist, Charles Brown-Sequard [1817-1894], for insights into how 'life' has been (and can be) negotiated, characterised and employed in an experimental setting. Through Brown-Sequard, I describe 'life' as an experimental heuristic as much as a phenomenon or reaction of the body, and I argue that to access the phenomena of 'life' in the body (if this is possible), one must first engage with the epistemological framework in which it resides.
Education & Educational Research	Korea and the US have different levels of tolerance toward homosexuality. At the same time, the school in both countries is considered to reinforce homophobia and heteronormativity. This study focuses on juxtaposing Korean and American prospective teachers to compare their past and current understanding and attitudes toward homosexuality. The research highlights the differences and similarities between the attitudes of the prospective teachers from the two countries and analyses reasons behind these attitudes. This study also examines how the participants face their own biases, understand the complicated issues related to sexual minorities, challenge their own perceptions, and decide whether they would change or keep them. Ten Korean and 10 American prospective teachers participated in a journal writing project guided by anti-homophobic discourses. In the beginning of the project, the Korean participants displayed greater homophobia in a more drastic way than the American participants did. However, the difference between the two countries might be only superficial in that heterosexuality is placed as a norm in both countries. In other words, even though homosexuality is more tolerated in American society, it does not mean that it is accepted as part of the norm. At the end of the project, the American and the Korean participants agreed that heterosexist beliefs and practices permeate society and that such social institutions as schools play an important role in reproducing and reinforcing homophobia. However, three American participants remained silent on the final question of whether they would fight against homophobia and three Korean participants decided not to support homosexual issues. If one says nothing, one cannot be accused of homophobia. By their silence, they voiced their true feelings on the issue, that they didn't support it, showing that silence is far from neutral in a heterosexual society.
Economics	In this paper, we study the stationary and non-stationary equilibria of a deterministic, pure exchange, two-period overlapping generations model with habit persistence. We show that preferences with multiplicative habits can lead to quite different equilibrium outcomes compared to subtractive ones. The two most commonly adopted habit specifications can differ in terms of homotheticity, gross substitutability, and uniqueness of equilibria. We illustrate these differences in terms of steady-state equilibria, as well as local dynamics.
Political Science	What led elites in some U.S. states to surrender policy-making power to voters between 1898 and 1918, while leaders elsewhere retained only representative democracy? The authors argue that progressives behaved as strategic politicians by supporting direct democracy when they were stymied at achieving their goals in the legislature and were confident that the voters who would be empowered by initiatives that agreed with progressive policies. They made their delegation of power conditional on who would receive it. The presence of these underlying conditions made adoption of the citizen initiative likely, the authors posit, while the timing of reforms came when insurgent reformers had a strong presence in state government, when the results of a galvanizing election sent a clear signal, or when the adoption of the initiative in one state diffused to its neighbors. Exploring these hypotheses by analyzing a new data set, the authors find strong support for their expectations about the conditions that created fertile ground for direct democracy.
Cultural Studies	"This article considers Alfred Hitchcock's work in relation to the connotations of ""fallacy"" within conventional settings of modern Western society. Focusing on two films, Strangers on a Train (1951) and Rear Window (1954), we point to the phenomenon of the incidental push that leads toward an inextricable entanglement of characters, events, and psychic forces in what appear to be logical courses of action. We name this push ""the Hitchcockian nudge."" REPRESENTATIONS 140. Fall 2017 (C) The Regents of the University of California. ISSN 0734-6018, electronic ISSN 1533-855X, pages 159-74.

Education, Special	This study examined outcomes associated with participation in a program, Preparing for the ACT, designed to enhance student performance (N = 126) on the ACT college entrance exam. This targeted intervention was implemented as part of a three-tiered model of positive behavior support. Results of descriptive analyses revealed that only academic performance in the previous academic year was significant in predicting postintervention practice scores. Furthermore, students' postintervention scores were significant in predicting actual ACT scores. However, only in the case of the English subject area test were academic and behavioral performance predictive of English ACT scores. Results of a quasiexperimental design used to compare actual ACT performance for students who did and did not participate in the intervention suggested improved performance for students who did participate in the program, as evidenced by positive effect sizes-an increase in the percentage of students who met the district target scores and school mean scores that exceeded state mean scores following intervention participation. Limitations and implications for future research are offered.
Education & Educational Research	"Between 2006 and 2010, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction intervened in 128 low-performing schools, combining approaches consistent with school restructuring and transformation. In improved schools, local educators reconstructed key school functions, a distinctly nonlinear process more like the work of skilled craftsmen than that of design engineers that we refer to as ""scaffolded craftsmanship."" We interviewed key stakeholders in 12 high schools to learn about the dynamics accounting for the improvement or stalemate at each school. In sum, in the improved schools we studied, the turnaround process was not a matter of initial external design and subsequent implementation, but a non-linear process of planning, inventing, adjusting, and re-planning as well as a process of learning, doing, and learning from doing. The improvement generally began with the installation of new leadership and involved four main components: new commitment, climate, and culture; improved knowledge and skills; strategically organized and managed structures and supports for instruction; and strengthened external support. Our findings suggest that judicious personnel replacement followed by professional development and coaching targeted to key functions may be a more effective method for implementing school turnaround than the structural approaches promoted via NCLB sanctions and Race to the Top."
Transportation	About 63% of the world's shipping accidents are recurrentthey occur to ships that have already experienced at least one prior accident. Therefore, reducing recurrent accidents can contribute significantly to maritime safety. We study the factors affecting both first and recurrent accidents, by focusing on the duration between two accidents. Cox proportional hazard models are applied to ship accident data from 1996 to 2015, and the results identify which ships have a high risk of recurrent accidents, based on ship attributes, ship supply and market conditions, shipbuilding country, previous accident type, and ship type. The recurrent rate is high when the ship involved in the accident is old, small, flies a flag of convenience, and has no detention record. In addition, the accident risk increases when the shipping market faces a high bunker price, overcapacity in supply, a high time charter rate, or low newbuilding price. On the other hand, ships built in China and Japan have lower recurrent accident rates than those built elsewhere, although ships built in China have earlier first accidents than do others. General cargo ships have the highest recurrent accident rate, followed by dry bulkers, container ships, and tankers, in that order.
Business, Finance	For annual reporting periods beginning on or after I January 2005, Australian companies were required to comply with the Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS). To ensure a smooth transition, a broadly defined standard (AASB 1047) mandated pre-adoption company disclosures of the AIFRS' impact. The standard provided managers with the opportunity to exercise considerable discretion in complying with the underlying disclosure requirements. We examine how this discretion impacted on the quality of pre-adoption AIFRS disclosures provided by a sample of large Australian companies. Using a disclosure quality index, we find considerable evidence of a cross-sectional variation in disclosure quality that varies according to differences in the AIFRS financial impact, size, industry and profitability factors. Importantly, we also observe individual Big 4 audit firm influences on disclosure quality. These findings highlight consequences of mandating corporate disclosures based on broadly defined principles.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers is often helpful for predicting disease or a poor clinical outcome. We consider the prediction of both large and small for gestational age births by using longitudinal ultrasound measurements, and we attempt to identify subgroups of women for whom prediction is more (or less) accurate, should they exist. We propose a tree-based approach to identifying such subgroups, and a pruning algorithm which explicitly incorporates a desired type I error rate, allowing us to control the risk of false discovery of subgroups. The methods proposed are applied to data from the Scandinavian Fetal Growth Study and are evaluated via simulations.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Place reputation refers to the composite of ideas held by external audiences that play an important role in the development and success of that place. A negative place reputation can be very slow and difficult to change, but place reputation management seeks to adjust it so that it is closer to how stakeholders would like the place to be perceived. Research suggests that this should reflect the quality of place (i.e. what is there, who is there, and what is going on there) that defines it and makes it attractive to both residents and tourists. This research examines a place reputation management strategy employed by the Houston Convention & Visitors Bureau (HCVB) in which the organization's website features media articles as an 'objective' depiction of the city. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 66 media articles, including 425 photographs, revealed an emphasis on Houston's culinary culture. In particular, the manifest content shows that independent local restaurants driven by innovative chefs inspired by various influences are creating a vibrant culinary culture. The latent content shows that an understanding of this culinary culture can offer greater insight into the city, beyond the stereotypes, that allows one to better appreciate the quality of place that makes it a creative destination.
Public Administration	"There have been significant changeovers in media with the reconstruction period that started in 1980s and neo-liberal policies. In the communication environment that changed, public service broadcasters lost their monopoly and faced big problems both in Europe and in Turkey. From this viewpoint, the study aims to reveal what kind of effects neo-liberal policies had on public service broadcasting and how TRT was affected by this changed communication environment. In this respect, in the study, changes in the media and the effects of these changes on TRT are studied through ""reconstruction"", ""neo- liberalism"", and ""public service broadcasting"" concepts under a variety of categories."
Business, Finance	Assets with asymmetric correlation tend to cause portfolios to have negative skewness. We develop measures of asymmetric correlation based on portfolio skewness. We find that asymmetric correlation is better measured with the skewness of smaller portfolios. The skewness of individual-stock returns has the most significant and consistent explanatory power for stock returns, indicating that asymmetric correlation is generated at the asset level of individual firms.
Management	Risk assessment of urban areas aims at limiting the impact of harmful events by increasing awareness of their possible consequences.Qualitativerisk assessment allows to figure out possible risk situations and to prioritize them, whereasquantitativerisk assessment is devoted to measuring risks from data, in order to improve preparedness in case of crisis situations. We propose an automatic approach to comprehensive risk assessment. This leverages on a semantic and spatiotemporal representation of knowledge of the urban area and relies on a software system including: a knowledge base; two components for quantitative and qualitative risk assessments, respectively; and a WebGIS interface. The knowledge base consists of the TERMINUS domain ontology, to represent urban knowledge, and of a geo-referenced database, including geographical, environmental and urban data as well as temporal data related to the levels of operation of city services. CIPcast DSS is the component devoted to quantitative risk assessment, and WS-CREAM is the component supporting qualitative risk assessment based on computational creativity techniques. Two case studies concerning the city of Rome (Italy) show how this approach can be used in a real scenario for crisis preparedness. Finally, we discuss issues related to plausibility of risks and objectivity of their assessment.
Environmental Studies	This article presents the results of a global study on resettlement practice in the mining industry. We examine how international policy commitments are operationalised by the mining sector and how practitioners from across the institutional spectrum engage with planning and implementation efforts by the industry. Interviews were conducted with 52 senior practitioners from mining companies, consultancies, international finance institutions and international non-government organisations. Results confirm knowledge, resourcing, capacity and coordination gaps among each of the institutions. These findings give additional substance to emerging reports about the urgent need to improve performance in this area of practice. The article concludes with a call for further sector-specific research into mining and resettlement.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Background: Over the past two decades, there have been increasingly long waiting times for heart transplantation. We studied the relationship between heart transplant waiting time and transplant failure (removal from the waitlist, pretransplant death, or death or graft failure within 1 year) to determine the risk that conservative donor heart acceptance practices confer in terms of increasing the risk of failure among patients awaiting transplantation. Methods: We studied a cohort of 28,283 adults registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing heart transplant waiting list between 2000 and 2010. We used Kaplan-Meier methods with inverse probability censoring weights to examine the risk of transplant failure accumulated over time spent on the waiting list (pretransplant). In addition, we used transplant candidate blood type as an instrumental variable to assess the risk of transplant failure associated with increased wait time. Results: Our results show that those who wait longer for a transplant have greater odds of transplant failure. While on the waitlist, the greatest risk of failure is during the first 60 days. Doubling the amount of time on the waiting list was associated with a 10% (1.01, 1.20) increase in the odds of failure within 1 year after transplantation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship between time spent on the waiting list and transplant failure, thereby supporting research aimed at defining adequate donor heart quality and acceptance standards for heart transplantation.
History	"The article provides an overview of Greek Civil War remembrance culture and history politics between 1949 and nowadays. After the disastrous defeat of the Communist Democratic Army of Greece in the summer of 1949 the Greek Civil War was remembered in ""national-minded"", anti-communist Greece of 1950-1974 as a ""treacherous"" collaboration of the Greek Communist Party with ""foreign enemies"" in order to surrender Greece to ""Soviet imperialism"". The collapse of the Colonels' Junta in the summer of 1974 caused enormous changes in the Greek post-war remembrance culture. Not anymore the ""national-minded"" winners but the losers of the Greek Civil War had the dominant influence on the historical narrative of the 1940s. The communistled resistance movement of EAM/ELAS of the years 1941-1944 was heroized, the blame for the outbreak of the Civil War was put exclusively on ""American imperialism"". The last part of the articles discusses the academic controversy which has been going on since 2000 between historians of the ""old"" postdictatorial school and the ones representing the so-called ""new wave"" in the historical research of the Occupation- and Civil War-Period (1941-1949) in Greece."
Urban Studies	Seoul is a major global city with a history of over 600 years. Its development trajectory, current status in the world economy, and challenges faced in socio-spatial dynamics present an excellent case in the study of cities, especially of the Asia-Pacific region. This profile outlines Seoul's historical development, recent changes and contemporary conditions (in terms of its territory, economy, land and housing market, urbanisation policy, infrastructure development, social impact and culture), metropolitan planning, and future development.

Business	Three studies examine the relation between power distance belief (PDB), the tendency to accept and expect inequalities in society; power, the control one has over valued resources; and charitable giving. Results suggest that the effect of PDB depends on the power held by the donor. In low-PDB contexts, people high (vs. low) in psychological power tend to be more self-focused (vs. other-focused), and this leads them to be less charitable. In high-PDB contexts, however, people high (vs. low) in psychological power tend to be more other-focused (vs. self-focused), and this leads them to be more charitable. The authors also explore several boundary conditions for these relationships and conclude with the implications of these findings.
Social Issues	How does competition for resources affect the fundraising performance of local United Way (UW) affiliates? Drawing upon population ecology, we hypothesize a nonlinear relationship between competition and organizational performance. Using a 21-year panel data set that includes UW campaign data, contributions to specialized fundraising organizations, and contributions to the general population of nonprofit organizations, we estimate a fixed effects regression model. We find that the effect of competition differs depending upon the degree of niche overlap. Contributions to organizations with greatest niche overlap have a negative effect on contributions to local UWs. Consistent with population ecology, other types of fundraising organizations that have less niche overlap show beneficial relationships at certain levels of giving. However, few communities reach the philanthropic level at which benefits of competition occur.
Rehabilitation	Since the late 1970s, music therapy has been an important part of multidisciplinary palliative care programs. Despite its wide application and high acceptance by patients, caregivers and staff members, recent systematic reviews and reports point to a lack of research, and the need for controlled clinical trials. The present article reviews the methodological quality of controlled clinical trials on the effects of music therapy in palliative care and addresses issues regarding the implementation of such designs. We identified eight studies (both published and unpublished), conducted between 2003 and 2013, through a systematic search of the scientific literature. We present major challenges according to the PICOS taxonomy and provide recommendations for future research using controlled clinical trial designs.
Linguistics	We discuss ellipsis of the possessee in both pronominal possessor constructions (Dutch: zijn boek 'his book') and possessor doubling constructions (Dutch: John z'n boek, John his book 'John's book') from a micro-comparative perspective. More specifically we show, on the basis of an in-depth study of the nominal system of 57 Dutch dialects, that there are two types of possessee ellipsis. In the first type there is a pro which needs to be licensed by gender agreement. In the second type there is an overt pro-form, similar to English one, and hence no ellipsis. Dialects that have the first type of possessee ellipsis can be further divided into two subtypes. The first has gender agreement on the possessive pronoun, the second one does not. Interestingly, possessee ellipsis can take place in the possessor doubling construction only in the former subtype of dialect. We implement this striking generalization by arguing that in the latter type of dialect pro has to move to Spec,DP in order to be licensed. The doubling possessor also has to be merged in Spec,DP. As a consequence, pro and a doubling possessor cannot co-occur and hence possessee ellipsis and possessor doubling are incompatible. In the former type of dialect, i.e., those dialects that do express gender on the possessive pronoun, pro can be licensed by the gender agreement on the possessive pronoun in a position lower than Spec,DP. Hence, in these dialects Spec,DP is available for a doubling possessor and, consequently, possessee ellipsis and possessor doubling can co-occur.
Demography	This study investigated left-behind Filipino fathers and their involvement as child caregivers. It hypothesized that social support and well-being predict paternal involvement, with well-being as the mediator. Results showed that familial and peer support predicted involvement, with well-being as mediator. Spousal support did not predict involvement or well-being. Findings highlight the importance of familial and peer support to left-behind fathers. Interactions between significant predictors of involvement present novel pathways to childcare. The non-significant role of spousal support is discussed in the context of transnational migration. Intervention development that involves families and peers is suggested.
Business	Brand placements are gradually becoming an important part of promotional toolkit of many major companies. However, despite the increasing volume of research on brand placements during the last decade, several important questions still remain unanswered. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of brand placements in television sitcoms and contrast it with the effectiveness of 30-second commercials. The authors administer a quasi-natural experiment to a sample of research panel participants to investigate how brand placements in television sitcoms affect their attitudes and purchase intentions. Results of the study suggest that people have a more positive attitude toward brand placements than toward traditional television commercials. Moreover, placements can be more effective than 30-seconds commercials when targeting audiences with low attitude toward advertising. Finally, a combination of a brand placement and a commercial within one program doesn't significantly increase brand attitudes and purchase intentions compared with sole exposure conditions.

History Of Social Sciences	This article explores the historical context, process and result of introducing and implementing 'new' town planning in early post-war Taiwan. The two so-called 'garden cities' are examined: Jhong-Sing New Village and Yonghe City, both of which were formulated in the mid-1950s by the same group of local planners. It reveals that the assumed necessity of importing Western planning paradigms arose from the abrupt escalation of urban concentration caused by the late 1940s mass migrations from China. To cope with this unprecedented population growth, planning profession was swiftly established. The novice planners, in search of a reference for developing 'new' towns to decentralise excessive urbanisation, modelled their 'new' town planning on English suburban morphology. In the absence of an input of external expertise, the planners appeared to mistake aesthetic order and pastoral imagery of low-density residential development in England as practically viable solutions to the pressing urban problems in Taiwan. In a false hope that adopting Western ideas and practices would quickly lead the island to a better world, Taiwan initiated the importation of planning paradigms. This planning transfer not only evidently manifests a mode of 'borrowing' in post-colonial countries in international diffusion but also re-articulates the disseminating nature of modern planning and the existence of one-direction flows characterising the global dynamics of diffusion in the twentieth century.
Criminology & Penology	Research SummaryIn this paper, we argue that both science and the policy process are well served by research with high evidentiary value. We also argue that experimental research is valuable in the policy domain not only because of its high evidentiary content but also because of its transparency. To exemplify this point, we describe how a decade-long research program on hot spots policing overturned the conventional wisdom that police could not affect crime and, in so doing, has profoundly altered police practice. Still, we recognize that for a variety of practical and ethical reasons, policy-relevant research on policing and criminal justice policy more generally cannot be based entirely on experiments. We discuss two key features of randomizationbalance in expectation between the treated and the control group on all potential confounders and exogeneity of treatment statusthat are the source of the high evidentiary status of randomized experiments. We go on to describe how these same two features can be credibly replicated in quasi-experimental studies that are not subject to the ethical and practical obstacles that may make experiments impractical in some circumstances. Policy ImplicationsWe urge criminologists to take greater advantage of quasi-experimental research opportunities. We also recommend that criminologists go beyond simply identifying such opportunities. They should engage practitioners and policy makers and make clear what is required to allow for strong evidence of program effectiveness.
Communication	Informal relationships between journalists and politicians have a strategic function in the process of news-making. The aim of this article is to analyse the role of personal affinity between the media and politicians in Spain. This study focuses on the following three specific issues: self-definition of their interactions, degree of influence, and main professional risks and benefits detected. The methodology is based on 45 in-depth interviews (22 journalists, 16 politicians and 7 spin-doctors). The novelty of this article is the analysis of not only the views of journalists but also the perceptions of the political actors. The results demonstrate the relevance and influence of affinity relationships between journalists and politicians. The two types of actors are highlighted as main beneficiaries of direct access to high-quality information sources or the ability to achieve positive news coverage. However, certain risks are also linked to these informal relationships.
History	"As Bolivian inflation spiraled out of control in 1956, the United States-which had been aiding the revolutionary Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) government since 1953 in hopes of steering it down a conservative path-deployed banker George Jackson Eder to implement a monetarist stabilization plan that in many ways presaged the neoliberal reforms imposed across Latin America three decades later. The ""Eder Plan"" initiated in late 1956 stabilized the Bolivian currency, slashed government spending, and reoriented fiscal policy to prioritize payment on Bolivia's foreign debt and compensation to the deposed tin oligarchy. By restoring ""free rein to private enterprise,"" Eder also sought to ""purge"" the government of all elements sympathetic to socialism, structuralism, and Keynesianism-what he called the ""forces of darkness."" The Eder Plan was a key turning point in the MNR's economic policy, and also signaled the beginning of the process of estrangement of the MNR from its working-class support base."
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	During the early 1990s the proportion of a cohort entering higher education in the UK doubled over a short period of time. The paper investigates the effect of the expansion on graduates' early labour market attainment, focusing on overeducation. We define overeducation by combining occupation codes and a self-reported measure for the appropriateness of the match between qualification and the job. We therefore define three groups of graduates: matched, apparently overeducated and genuinely overeducated. This measure is well correlated with alternative definitions of overeducation. Comparing pre- and post-expansion cohorts of graduates, we find with this measure that the proportion of overeducated graduates has doubled, even though overeducation wage penalties have remained stable. We do not find that type of institution affects the probability of genuine overeducation. Apparently overeducated graduates are mostly indistinguishable from matched graduates, whereas genuinely overeducated graduates principally lack non-academic skills and suffer a large wage penalty. Individual unobserved heterogeneity differs between the three groups of graduates but controlling for it does not alter these conclusions.
Environmental Studies	This work proposes a conceptual framework that combines the service ecosystems view (stemming from Service-Dominant logic) with the concept of territorial ecosystems (stemming from destination management studies). The paper aims at exploring the underlying dynamics of territorial ecosystems that can impact the competitiveness and sustainability of a community as a whole. The main goal is to support decision making in disadvantaged territories characterized by the urge to harmonize needs to achieve a sustainable advantage. Based on a literature review of the evolution of territory in destination management, a model for meta-management in territorial ecosystems is proposed. The empirical research adopts a mixed method (content analysis and semi-structured interviews) to explore the single case study of Libera, an Italian non-profit association that challenges organized crime. The study reframes Libera, its actors and territory as a service ecosystem. The findings from the case study reveal the existence of different types of territorial capital at the micro, meso and macro-level. Moreover, the results allow the identification of three main steps that the governance can realize at a meta-management level to harmonize the actor's objectives and goals and foster the creation of a cohesive sustainable-oriented culture. From a theoretical point of view, the study encourages further research to introduce a strategic framework able to identify different strategies for value co-creation and sustainable outcomes. Revealing the key drivers for the local development and sustainability of territories can help managers understand how to optimize the relationships of all the ecosystem's stakeholders and how to monitor value co-creation in progress during all the phases of the service provision.
Transportation	Intercontinental air traffic is unevenly distributed between secondary European airports. While a few airports offer a remarkable number of long haul services, most non-hubs struggle to attract such flights. We discuss and test factors influencing secondary airport choice of long haul carriers. Results indicate that the economic power of the airport region has a significantly positive influence on long haul flight supply, while a sufficient runway length is only a condition sine qua non. Consequently, long runways at many secondary airports are underutilized and thus not economically viable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	This paper establishes some asymptotic results for both finite and ultimate ruin probabilities in a discrete time risk model with constant interest rates, and individual net losses in R(-alpha); the class of regular variation with index alpha > 0. The individual net losses are allowed to be generally dependent while they have zero index of upper tail dependence, so that our results partially generalize the counterparts in Tang (2004). The procedure of deriving our results also demonstrates a new approach of achieving asymptotic formulation for ruin probabilities when the individual risks are dependent.
History	The first professional societies in the United States, from the 1880s to the 1910s, understood history to be closely associated with the other social sciences. Even in the mid-twentieth century, history was still grouped with the other social sciences, along with economics, sociology, political science, and anthropology. But in the past few decades, history and anthropology in the United States (though not necessarily in other countries) have moved away from the social sciences to ally themselves with the humanitiesparadoxically, just when the other social sciences are becoming more committed to historical research.

Political Science	This article explores the meaning of work for American democracy through a study of the writings of the Progressive political theorist Herbert Croly. Drawing primarily on his two principal political writings, The Promise of American Life and Progressive Democracy, the article interprets his political thought as on attempt to realize democracy by changing the way Americans think about work. Close attention is paid to his views on three topics: occupation, specialization, and administrative organization. According to Croly a reconceptualization of work could correct the atomizing and conformist tendencies of modern industrial life, could enhance the efficiency and increase the productivity of both managers and workers, and could facilitate the development of an administrative state that would distribute labor in response to public desires and needs. The essay concludes with a discussion of how Croly can help us understand the political challenges and possibilities posed by the contemporary American experience of work.

Substance Abuse	Aim: Perspectives on rural alcohol and other drug (AOD) service provision were explored. Methods: A mixed methods approach included a document review, service monitoring data, regional group fora with AOD and other health providers (109), semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from health, policy and research (53), and interviews with rural AOD services users (21). Findings: Alcohol is the main drug used by people in rural Victoria, followed by cannabis and then heroin. Services are allocated within a unit cost funding model and distributed on a regional or statewide basis. AOD treatment is dominated by outpatient therapy, outreach and rural withdrawal. Pharmacotherapy and residential rehabilitation are in short supply. Distance, stigma, and confidentiality concerns are barriers to treatment. Recruiting and retaining workers is difficult. The system continues to develop; secondary consultations and networking strategies increase capacity in other care systems. Hospital involvement in AOD treatment varies according to other health demands. Conclusions: Many aspects of the rural AOD service provider's role enhance service delivery by extending reach and capacity. This occurs through AOD models, such as outreach, as well as strategies for working with other systems that include networking and secondary consultation. While there is task diffusion beyond traditional understandings of AOD treatment, the service delivery role may be understood as specialist in its own right. Recognition of this role as specialist may support staff recruitment and retention, while building potential for career pathways.
Law	"In 1978, after two years of contentious litigation, the City of Memphis entered into a unique agreement with its citizens: it signed a consent decree, stipulating that it would halt its interference with First Amendment-protected activities. More specifically, the Consent Decree barred the City from surveilling protesters-the very conduct that triggered litigation. Fast forward forty years. In 2018, narratives of police brutality dominated the nation's headlines. Consequently, protesters demonstrated from the streets of Ferguson, Missouri to Oakland, California. And in Memphis, Tennessee, those who protested were often met with an all-too-familiar response-surveillance by the Memphis Police Department. That is until the Western District of Tennessee found that the City had violated the terms of its own agreement. The court's message was undeniably clear-the Memphis Consent Decree is alive and well. Memphis is by no means an outlier in police-civilian relations. After all, police departments across the country surveil protesters. But Memphis is an outlier in terms of the method it has chosen to address this issue. As the surveillance of protesters and the capacity to surveil protesters grow, the Memphis Consent Decree offers a model for future legislation that better safeguards First Amendment values. This Note accordingly narrates the story of Memphis, its successes and failures, and the lessons it holds for hundreds of cities, for decades to come. ""MPD has the opportunity to become one of the few, if only, metropolitan police departments in the country with a robust policy for the protection of privacy in the digital age. The Court recognizes this may be a heavy burden; being a pioneer usually is."""
Law	"Events over the last year have generated significant questions about how democratic discourse can proceed in a post-truth society where empirical evidence has little persuasive value. Justice Brandeis once famously claimed that the best way to combat pervasive falsehoods and political misperceptions was through ""more speech,"" but that strategy is built on the assumption that errors arise out of information deficits. As contemporary debate shows, the Brandesian response is ill-suited to a world increasingly built on ""alternative facts."" Fortunately, interdisciplinary research not only explains why existing methods of persuasion fail, it also describes how to combat the problems associated with the modern legal and political climate. The current Article addresses the problem of pervasive political misconceptions through the lens of the ongoing debate about the legitimacy of international arbitration. Numerous empirical studies indicate that international arbitration-meaning both international commercial (business-to-business) arbitration and investment (investor-state) arbitration-offers a fair and unbiased means of resolving complex, high-value legal disputes through sophisticated, highly formal procedures that more closely resemble judicial procedures in commercial courts than domestic arbitration. Critics routinely ignore this data, however, and continue to question the validity of the procedure. Why? Through empirical and theoretical studies conducted by political scientists, philosophers, psychologists, and economists, this Article demonstrates how three phenomena-sticky defaults, status quo bias, and the sovereign prerogative-work in parallel to create enduring, but demonstrably incorrect, perceptions about the legitimacy of international arbitration. Interdisciplinary research also provides a potential solution in the form of a heuristic known as the Reversal Test, which acts as an objective diagnostic tool to identify the influence of unconscious cognitive distortions such as the status quo bias. Through this analysis, this Article not only addresses one of the core paradoxes in international dispute resolution, but also provides intriguing insights into policy debates in other fields."
Transportation	"The future of travel will be affected by a number of disruptive changes, including advancements in vehicle technology, such as automated vehicles, changes in population demographics and the economy, and lifestyle changes. It is difficult to say just how much each change will affect the amount and type of travel in the future, especially given the amount of uncertainty there is regarding the trajectory of these changes and their effects. The authors examined changes that are likely to affect transportation behaviors in the future, developed a ""fuzzy cognitive map"" (FCM) of the relationships, and used the FCM model to investigate the effects of those relationships. The results of the study show that FCM models offer a promising method for transportation planners to enhance their ability to reason about system effects when quantitative information is limited and uncertain. More specifically, the results provide some initial guidance on the potential impacts of disruptive changes on future travel, which may help in targeting limited research funds on the most consequential potential changes."
Environmental Studies	Providing operators with objective incentives for cost efficiency and continuous improvement in the provision of public services are major concerns for regulators. Measuring efficiency empirically is complex and this complexity is accentuated when the same operator is responsible for delivering more than one service (e.g. in order to explore potential economies of scope). Based on a sample of operators that provide water and wastewater services, this paper uses a shared input data envelopment analysis model to measure separately the efficiency of each service. The results show that a single measure may not provide enough information for monitoring multi-utilities. Together with other indicators, the proposed model can assist decision-makers in prioritizing efforts to improve overall efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Information Science & Library Science	Most studies on O2O services have focused solely on the technological merits of mobile applications, overlooking the role of the value systems that underlie people's lifestyles. In contrast, this research sheds light on how people's value systems influence their decision to adopt food delivery applications. Particularly, it proposes that people's moral obligation in meal preparation can change the mode of thinking that guides their adoption decision. Namely, moral obligation is assumed to restrict people from acting on their basic convenience orientation in meal preparation. Empirical results have supported this assumption by showing that people with a high moral obligation (or married people) are more reluctant to convert their basic convenience-seeking tendencies into actual adoption intention than those with a low moral obligation (or single people). The important theoretical and managerial implications of these results are also discussed.
Education, Special	Meaningful inclusion of quantitative reasoning into mathematics instruction requires meaningful ways to evaluate it. Few formative assessments exist to evaluate the strategies students use when reasoning mathematically. The Framework for Evaluating Quantitative Reasoning Strategies presented in this article provides teachers with categories for evaluating types of quantitative reasoning strategies students use for problems in the mathematical domain of number and operations. Numerous examples of the types of strategies students use for comparing fractions and how to evaluate the complexity of these strategies are provided. Included are research-based instructional recommendations for moving students toward a deeper conceptual understanding of fractions as numbers.
Ethnic Studies	In October 2011, the Basque armed organization ETA announced an end to its activities. This article aims at studying the reasons leading up to this unilateral decision which had been taken without prior negotiations or agreements. To this end, a large part of existing bibliography on the subject was consulted and most of the documents released by ETA in recent years, including those for internal use, were also reviewed. In our opinion, ETA reached this decision on the basis of two conclusions and an overall view of the state of affairs. The first of these conclusions found that the two main channels opened up in 1975 to reach its tactical goals, namely, negotiation with Spain and a national front, had been fully exploited. The second concerns the great difficulty in continuing to defend armed struggle on the grounds that it helps reinforce these two channels. Moreover, the belief that it is possible to make greater advances without, rather than with, armed activity, was widespread, paradoxical as that might seem. Forty years after its political positioning with respect to post-Franco Spain, convinced that both channels had been exhausted, and of its limited legitimacy to explore new ones in its capacity as a political movement, ETA reassessed the situation, and once again changed its discourse and practice, with an aim to attaining its strategic goals.
Gerontology	"Reminiscence functions have been shown to be associated with positive mental health and well-being in certain older adult populations. However, there is little known regarding the functions of reminiscence in older African-Americans. The purpose of this study was to examine the perceived benefits and functions of reminiscence in a sample of community-dwelling older African-Americans. The purposive sample included African-American adults (N = 52) over the age of 60. Data were collected via focus groups and participant observations in senior centers and churches in an urban area in the Northeast. Participants' descriptions of the benefits and functions of reminiscence and researchers' journals were analyzed using immersion/crystallization technique as described by Borkan (1999). The following themes emerged from the data: 1) Something Like a Big Dictionary, 2) Moving On, 3) Fellowship, Faith and Family, 4) Teaching the Young and 5) A Brand New Knowledge of Ourselves. Using Webster's taxonomy of Reminiscence Functions to compare and contrast data, results provide contextual support for the reminiscence functions of: Identity, Teach/Inform, Intimacy Maintenance, Problem Solving, and Conversation in this sample of older African-Americans. These participants viewed reminiscing for Boredom Reduction, Bitterness Revival, and Death Preparation as negative and ""leads to depression"". These findings have implications for how reminiscence is facilitated with older African-American adults to improve their mental health and well-being. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Education, Special	Students with significant disabilities must participate in large-scale assessments, often using an alternate assessment judged against alternate achievement standards. The development and administration of this type of assessment must necessarily balance meaningful participation with accurate measurement. In this study, generalizability theory is used to estimate the dependability of reading items and tasks that have been administered using two formats of communication (receptive and expressive). The results reflect a trade-off between meaningful participation and accurate measurement of students with significant cognitive disabilities, particularly when considering the two formats. Significant variance is obtained for persons interacting with tasks, whereas the effect of raters is negligible. Furthermore, these results appear to vary across administrative format.
Social Work	Volunteers play a vital role in modem societies by boosting the labor force within both the public and private sectors. While the factors that may lead people to volunteer have been investigated in a number of studies, the means by which volunteering contributes to the well-being of such volunteers is poorly understood. It has been suggested through studies that focus on the absence of depression in volunteers that self-esteem and sense of control may be major determinants of the increased well-being reported by volunteers. This is consistent with the homeostatic model of subjective well-being, which proposes that self-esteem, optimism, and perceived control act as buffers that mediate the relationship between environmental experience and subjective well-being (SWB). Using personal well-being as a more positive measure of well-being than absence of depression, this study further explored the possible mediating role of self-esteem, optimism, and perceived control in the relationship between volunteer status and well-being. Participants (N = 1,219) completed a 97-item survey as part of the Australian Unity Wellbeing project. Variables measured included personal well-being, self-esteem, optimism, and a number of personality and psychological adjustment factors. Analyses revealed that perceived control and optimism, but not self-esteem, mediated the relationship between volunteer status and personal well-being.
Social Work	The domain of outcome research is enormous and the consequences weighty. Ethical, practical, and political goals of evaluation have insured a multitude of outcome studies concerning social, behavioral, and educational interventions as well as critiques thereof and descriptions of how to conduct related research. We have a rich literature guiding the design, conduct, reporting, and dissemination of outcome studies as well as a rich literature showing that such studies are often flawed and often hype inflated claims of knowledge (or ignorance). Uncertainties are often ignored resulting in harm to clients. I suggest that a focus on avoidable ignorance and its harmful consequences as well as taking advantage of Grice's maxims of discourse guided by ethical obligations of professionals to do more good than harm will increase the percentage of sound outcome studies and accurate reporting.
Women'S Studies	This article draws on the classroom experiences of the author to reflect on the pedagogic shifts in Gender Studies. Along with its recognition as being a proper' discipline and the need to have Gender Studies at all levels in a university, comes the question of legitimacy. It must now be defined by boundaries, protocols and methodologies. I look at the manner in which these conditions unfold in two settingsin the undergraduate and the research classrooms. In the first context, young, freshly-out-of-school students appear to view Gender Studies as a gender sensitisation programme while in the latter methodological/ empirical certainties often take precedence over the need for analytical probing. In both cases, the initial imagination of the subject as a critical perspective' across disciplines appears to yield to a more official, programmatic understanding. In my own context, I grapple with the simultaneous visibility and reduction of Women's/Gender Studies.
Cultural Studies	Kenya has become a site of, and frame for, the contradictions of queer livability on one hand and queer visibility on the other. Despite virulent attacks by the political and religious section of the country against queer sexual expression, there is a visible queer existence that is predicated on embodied lived experiences and spatial subjectivity. In this paper, I investigate selected city-spaces in Nairobi - nightclub, tavern and cruising spot - to explore the ways that these locations enable their users to animate the space, allowing their mobility and therefore enabling their existence within the contradiction. I speculate on how the users imagine themselves within these spaces. Secondly, I ask what significations are accrued to the user's subjectivities in relation to, and as a result of these spaces. I contend that the structure of these spaces allows for queer, queering and queered flows that make it possible for queer users to subvert the spaces and to make it possible to read, locate and recognize queer subjectivities within these spaces.
Education & Educational Research	In educational psychology, the theories of interest and self-determination have been well studied to find the relationships between learning attitudes and learning outcomes. However, the instructional design and the learning behaviors are the two missing elements which have not been fully investigated in the learning process. Therefore, we conducted two studies longitudinally with 2years data from a 13-week engineering course at the City University of Hong Kong in a blended learning environment to verify the criticalness of these elements in these studies. With engagement records being collected from the learning management system in the second year, we further correlated the relationship from situational interest to engaged learning and finally the academic performance. Our findings make theoretical contributions by combining these two theories and link the model with behavior and achievement of students. It also demonstrates the importance of these theories on the instructional design.
Cultural Studies	This article discusses aspirational mobility and the digital gift in the context of forced migration in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It illustrates how gifting a mobile device and data enhances the aspirational mobility of forced migrants and intervenes into political codes, which promote social and technological isolation. Through the example of fieldwork with forced migrants and social media analysis, the article shows how participation, self-presentation, and social control were encouraged through the object and data gift. The migrants amplified their aspirational mobility by participating in urban life, presenting themselves in digital space, and maintaining romantic sociality with members of other marginalized migrant groups. The article elaborates on previous notions of technology as expanding social worlds for forced migrants while also highlighting the potential of technology for social control between migrant groups. The article also points to the potential dangers of social media use by asylum seekers for refugee status determination.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This study estimates the multiplier effect of the exhibition industry. In order to calculate the exhibition industry's total expenditure, consideration is made of three major sources of expenditure including hosts, exhibitors and foreign attendees. According to the summary of the economic impact analysis, the total exhibition receipts of US$645.7 million produced US$1.2 billion in output; 21 692 full-time equivalent jobs, US$260 million in personal income for residents, US$577.4 million in value-added, US$54.2 million in indirect tax and US$104.3 million in imports.

Urban Studies	In this Cities viewpoint forum, we argue that there is a need to rethink U.S./U.K.-centric approaches to the urban university in policy and practice. Gathering three critical commentaries by practitioners from within the Singaporean higher education system, the forum responds to the challenges of: (1) broadened expectation placed on higher education institutions; (2) the pressures and possibilities of global urbanization; and (3) the provocation to theorize the urban, and thus the urban university, from beyond the 'Global North'. Following an introduction detailing the history and relevance of the Singaporean case, the three viewpoints seek to illustrate the various dimensions of university urbanism in the 'Lion City'. Each address what the idea of being an urban university means, and how it is operationalized in Singapore. Key policy and conceptual insights illuminate a higher education regime negotiating the tensions between national developmentalist agendas and the opportunities opened by global urban connectivity. Significantly, and in contrast to current urban university paradigms, we find Singapore's university sector internalizing and operating with a particular technocratic urban ontology that, while partial, helps collapses the distinction between universities being 'in', 'of, or 'for' the city and opens new avenues to analyze and mobilize universities in urban(izing) society.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objectives: To ascertain the knowledge, attitudes and practices of adult population in Puducherry, India, regarding Dengue Fever (DF). Study design: A cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the Knowledge, Awareness and Preventive practices (KAP) among a selected community in Puducherry on DF, following a major dengue outbreak in 2012. Methods: Between October 2012 & February 2013, an epidemiological survey was conducted among 400 households (HHs) from the most affected areas during dengue outbreak, which came under eight health delivery jurisdictions i.e. Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in Puducherry. Knowledge of dengue and the use of preventive measures were assessed by means of a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was done to examine the association between different levels of education and income status with the knowledge of DF. The DF knowledge map was created based on the results achieved through the questionnaire using Arc GIS 10.2 software. Results: Although about 86% of the participants had heard of dengue, although there was no adequate knowledge on dengue vector breeding habitat as 68% of the respondents thought drains & garbage as breeding places of dengue vectors. Only 25% of participants were aware of clean water as a breeding habitat. Insufficient knowledge of disease symptoms was found, with fever (59%) being the most common symptom. Conclusions: There is a lack of in-depth knowledge on dengue epidemiology in the Puducherry community and observation revealed that more needs to be done by the Government as well as community members to prevent vector mosquito breeding.

Ethnic Studies	Ariely examines the logic of inclusion/exclusion involved in the allocation of social, political and cultural rights to minorities. He argues that the unequal allocation of rights is determined by the degree of potential power inherent in the various types of rights, and that rights with more potential power, such as political and cultural representation rights, challenge the dominant group's position more strongly than rights to social welfare and cultural autonomy. Minorities are included at a higher level in spheres of rights with low potential power, and at a lower level in spheres of rights with higher potential power. He uses the case of the Arab citizens of Israel to illustrate the thesis, reviewing institutional practices of inclusion/exclusion as well as the attitudes of Israeli Jews towards the allocation of different rights as reflected in three attitudinal surveys.
Economics	A significant number of left political economists hold that the U.S. Great Recession and subsequent lethargic performance are a crisis of over-capacity that resulted from over-investment. Kotz (2011, 2013) has recently attempted to provide empirical support for this position. Despite sharing an understanding of the crisis very similar to his, the authors find in this paper that a careful examination of his evidence does not support considering this to be a crisis of over-investment.
Transportation	The coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden and nearby waters of the Indian Ocean stand as the most pirate-ridden area of the seas at this time and naval forces from many nations have descended upon the region to ensure the safe passage of commercial vessels; yet piracy for ransom continues. The US, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and now the European Union deploy their navies to disrupt raids, intercept and capture pirates attacking ships passing through the region. However, apprehending pirates is only effective if they can also be brought to a court capable of adjudicating their guilt. Increasingly, the captured suspects are being disarmed and released, lacking a reliable nearby littoral state to prosecute them. In this region, with few viable states either willing or capable of holding piracy trials, apprehending pirates meets only part of the challenge of abating the practise. What is needed is a court system capable of adjudicating these cases; yet a thicket of both law and custom limits the ability of seagoing states to adequately arrest and hand over to reliable prosecution high seas pirates. This article addresses the problems inherent in abating piracy by these means off the coast of East Africa.
Anthropology	Although there has been considerable scholarly interest in the nature of ancient cities, it has been difficult to identify and explore quantitative patterns in their design and amenities. Here, the authors offer a model for the relationship between the population size and infrastructural area of settlements, before testing it against measures of urban form in the Roman Empire. They advocate a more consistent approach to the investigation of settlements that is capable of not only incorporating sites with divergent physical forms and historical trajectories into the same model, but also able to expose their similarities and differences.
Communication	Landmark wildlife series like Life on Earth (1979), Planet Earth (2006) and Frozen Planet (2011) are synonymous with the BBC, and are largely seen as unquestioned embodiments of its public service values. Yet the landmark format for wildlife programming was designed from its outset to appeal to international television markets, particularly the US market. This article examines the history and evolution of David Attenborough's landmark series, tracing the development of the landmark format from its roots in the BBC's programming policy of the early 1960s through broader changes in national and international television markets to the development of the global brand BBC Earth. Combining close analysis of landmark wildlife series with ethnographic interviews with BBC Natural History Unit staff and detailed archival research, the article focuses on the role of BBC wildlife documentary in debates about how public service media should be defined and understood It is concluded that landmark wildlife series have always evinced the tensions between the BBC's public service values and the need for these series to appeal to global television markets.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	"Studying changes in the Justice and Development Party""s (AKP) politics within the general context of the long-lasting history of neoliberalism-neoconservatism in Turkey, this paper aims to provide a new perspective for analyzing the party""s recent drift to authoritarianism from the perspective of its gender politics. For many feminist scholars and activists, the recent changes in the AKP""s gender politics are a matter of an increase in the AKP""s oppression and patriarchal power. These analyses give no explicit account of why there has been an increase or if it is only a matter of an increase in the level of the oppressiveness of patriarchal power. From a perspective that questions this quantitative assumption (i.e. with an argument that the AKP""s politics has been equally oppressive for all women and from the very beginning of its rule), this paper aims to give insights into this complex process which led, first, to the emergence of neoliberal feminism as a new subjective position, and, later, to the modification of this official politics on women""s issue and the emergence of neoconservative feminism along with the AKP""s drift to authoritarianism in response to certain contradictory effects of neoliberalism and its eventual crisis."
Demography	In this paper, I analyse the changes that mothers and children experience in their relationship due to the physical separations and reunions entailed by the international migration process. I argue that the different geographical configurations that migrant families take over time are the outcome of a negotiation of care responsibility and desired geographies of family life, and are accompanied by changing meanings and practices in intimate relationships: the location of care relationships is influenced by the relatives' capacity both to take part in family negotiations as well as to overcome the constraints imposed by policies. Time is relevant because it leads to shifting meanings and practices of transnational family life, as well as to the changing role of children in the family.
History	The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the day to day activities of the inhabitants of the medieval communes of Kastav, Veprinac and Moscenice. By using the only remaining sources, the communal statutes, the paper will try to recreate the government organization of the communes, as well as how the statutory regulations shaped everyday life. With analysing these neighbouring medieval communes the paper will try to point out the similarities and differences of the three communal statutes, from the composition of the texts, to the subject of their articles. By researching these statutes the main focus of the paper will be to show their impact on the population.
Education & Educational Research	Background: Recognition of the importance of the development of intercultural competence (ICC) has placed intense pressure on teacher education programs to infuse a global perspective into their programs. Several studies have proposed integration of global elements into teacher education programs. Although the use of online tools for telecollaboration with students and teacher educators from other countries has positively influenced certain aspects of students' ICC, there have been limited research studies which have focused on promoting ICC in physical education (PE). Purpose: This study was designed to examine the development of the ICC of PE graduate students after completion of a seven-week global link with Korean students. Deardorff's Process Model of ICC served as the foundation for gaining understanding of the development of ICC. Student responses were examined in terms of the following: types of learning, perspectives toward partners and their cultures, influences on teaching practices, and presence of the elements included in the Process Model of ICC. Participants and setting: The 14 Caucasian Americans (F = 5, M = 9) were participated in this study. They were enrolled in one distance education graduate course focusing on professional issues in PE offered by one of the higher education institutions in the USA. Participants were engaged in a global link project in which each participant was matched with one Korean student. All participants held a teacher license, and 10 participants were teachers with 2-11 years of K-12 teaching experience. The four remaining participants were employed in university graduate assistance (N = 2) or community youth sport programs (N = 2). Data collection: Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Qualitative data included open-ended questionnaires, which were collected twice, and reflection reports, which were collected at the end of the global experience. Quantitative data were collected prior to and after the global link project using the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS). The global link project consisted of five weeks of individualized interactions and two weeks of group video conferencing. Participants were engaged in individualized interactions with their partners through technology tools (e.g. email, social networking, etc.) and via presentations that focused on particular educational issues in PE through video conferencing. Data analysis: Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed by using content analysis and multivariate analysis of variance, respectively. Triangulation across data sources and between the investigators, peer review and debriefing, and member checking between investigators and participants were utilized to maintain trustworthiness and credibility of the findings. Findings: Four themes emerged from the qualitative findings: (a) openness to other cultures, (b) expanding cultural knowledge, (c) clarifying cultural views, and (d) accommodating behaviors. The CQS data showed improvement in all dimensions (e.g. motivation, knowledge, and behavior) except the metacognitive dimension and significant improvement in the behavior dimension after the seven weeks of global link experiences. Discussion: The global link experiences promoted development of ICC including critical elements of ICC such as: attitude, knowledge/skills, and behaviors. This study recommends university teacher educators actively revise their program to incorporate a global view.
Education & Educational Research	The twenty first century university considers the use of both ICT for education and tutoring as quality factors and considers them in the internal quality assurance system. The necessity for flexibility in higher education requires the promotion of tutoring in its various forms such as individual, virtual or group tutoring. Furthermore, tutoring must be complementary to the teaching with an integral and comprehensive character. In this paper we analyze the use of the virtual modality of tutoring students versus individual and group tutoring and the most used kinds of virtual tools. In order to achieve these goals, a questionnaire designed ad hoc was filled in by a representative and stratified sample of students, specifically 976 students from the Faculty of Education at the University of Murcia, employing a non-experimental, descriptive and cross-sectional survey. The results highlight that virtual tutoring is the most used modality despite being the least valued, either due to a lack of knowledge among students or because they believe that a direct and personal relationship is more valuable for academic development. Moreover, the most used virtual tools are those that allow students to obtain information and to keep up to date with their subjects. The results from the survey lead us to consider that virtual tutoring should take better advantage of all the possibilities ICT offers as a tool to help and support the comprehensive development of students. University tutoring tools should be optimized and made profitable, and should no longer be considered as an isolated and responsive action.
Anthropology	Phylogenetic analyses require evolutionarily independent characters, but there is no consensus, nor has there been a clear methodology presented on how to define character independence in a phylogenetic context, particularly within a complex morphological structure such as the skull. Following from studies of craniofacial development, we hypothesize that the premaxilla is an independent evolutionary module with two integrated characters that have traditionally been treated as independent. We test this hypothesis on a large sample of primate skulls and find evidence supporting the premaxilla as an independent module within the larger module of the palate. Additionally, our data indicate that the convexity of the nasoalveolar clivus and the contour of the alveolus are integrated within the premaxilla. We show that the palate itself is composed of two distinct modules: the FNP-derived premaxillae and the mxBA1-derived maxillae and palatines. Application of our data to early African hominin facial morphology suggests that at least three separate transitions contributed to robust facial morphology: 1) an increase in the size of the post-canine dentition housed within the maxillae and palatines, 2) modification of the premaxilla generating a concave clivus and reduced incisor alveolus, and 3) modification of the zygomatic, shifting the zygomatic root and lateral face anteriorly. These data lend support to the monophyly of Paranthropus boisei and Paranthropus robustus, and provide mounting evidence in favor of a Paranthropus clade. This study also highlights the utility of applying developmental evidence to studies of morphological evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Sociology	"Drawing upon an extensive literature review on the topic of ""political professionalisation"" in the French social sciences, this article has two goals. The first is to specify the ways in which this term has been used in recent decades. It shows that, apart from the classical definition borrowed from Max Weber, three other definitions of political professionalisation are often present in the publications it cites, at least implicitly: based on the time spent in the political field; based on the career trajectory of the individual; or based on the knowledge acquired and ethos developed to thrive fully in the job. From there, the article identifies and discusses some of the most pressing issues currently facing researchers in this area, whether relating to the conceptual aspects or the measurement of the phenomenon, or to the reintegration of the problem into a broader social science framework. It also calls for a deeper engagement with the literature on work and occupation. Overall, the article sheds lights on some of the most important transformations that the French political sphere has undergone in recent decades."
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Promoting resilience among displaced adolescent girls in northern Pakistan may buffer against developmental risks such as violence exposure and associated longer-term consequences for physical and mental well-being. However, girls' access to such programming may be limited by social norms restricting movement. A mixed-method evaluation examined change over time, feasibility, and acceptability of the COMPASS program in three districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province through a single-group within-participant pretest-posttest of adolescent girls aged 12-19 enrolled in the intervention (n=78), and qualitative in-depth interviews with girls following posttest completion (n=15). Primary outcomes included improvements in movement, safety, and comfort discussing life skills topics with caregivers, operationalized quantitatively as number of places visited in the previous month, number of spaces that girls felt safe visiting, and comfort discussing puberty, education, working outside the home, and marriage, respectively. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial well-being, gendered rites of passage, social support networks, perceptions of support for survivors of violence, and knowledge of services. Quantitative pretest-posttest findings included significant improvements in movement, psychosocial well-being, and some improvements in social support, knowledge of services, and gendered rites of passage; findings on safety and comfort discussing life skills topics were not significant. Qualitative findings illuminated themes related to definitions of safety and freedom of movement, perceptions and acceptability of program content, perceptions of social support, and perceptions of blame and support and knowledge of services in response to violence. Taken together, findings illustrate positive impacts of life skills programming, and the need for societal changes on gender norms to improve girls' safety in public spaces and access to resources.
Law	The June 2015 visit of Sudanese President Al-Bashir to South Africa captured not only the legal community's attention, but also the attention of the entire world. For a brief moment, it appeared that he might have to face the serious accusations levelled against him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. However, that was not (yet) to be. This article provides a step-by-step account of the relevant events relating to President Al-Bashir's visit as well the explanation offered by the South African government of how it was that President Al-Bashir was able to leave the country in violation of an interim court order. In addition, it considers the written judgment of the North Gauteng High Court of South Africa holding that President Al-Bashir was not protected from arrest by virtue of Head of State immunity. On that matter, while the judgment was convincing in its rejection of the weak arguments presented by the state, its consideration of Head of State immunity - a matter not directly argued by the state - suffers from a lack of clarity. Lastly, this article examines the position articulated by ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II on the issue of President Al-Bashir's Head of State immunity: that it was implicitly removed via the text of United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) which referred the Darfur situation to the ICC. It does so in the light of the European Court of Human Right's pronouncement in Al-Jedda: that if the UN Security Council, pursuant to its resolutions, intended for states to act in a manner that would otherwise be inconsistent with their international obligations (in that case, international human rights law) then it would have used clear and explicit language to do so.
Communication	This article offers a way of using the theory of audience design-how speakers position different audience groups as main addressees, overhearers, or bystanders-for written discourse. It focuses on main addressees, that is, those audience members who are expected to participate in and respond to a speaker's utterances. The text samples are articles, letters, and editorials on women's suffrage that were published between 1909 and 1912 in Canadian periodicals. In particular, the author analyzes noun phrases with which suffrage-skeptical women are addressed, relying on the theory of constitutive rhetoric to highlight the interpellative force with which the audience design of this public political debate operates.
Social Work	This review of 10 years of qualitative research with disadvantaged children in the UK shows that despite some gaps in the knowledge base, there is now a substantive body of evidence exploring children's lives and experiences from their own perspectives. The review reveals that poverty penetrates deep into the heart of childhood, permeating every facet of children's lives from economic and material disadvantage, through the structuring and limiting of social relationships and social participation to the most personal often hidden aspects of disadvantage associated with shame, sadness and the fear of social difference and marginalisation.
History	This article analyzes the different conceptions of political representation at the foundational moment of independent Mexico. It understands liberalism as a heterogeneous and multifaceted political language that was constructed through the rhetoric of preventing despotism. Conceiving political representation in broad terms allows new elements and variables to be introduced in order to study it. The article concludes with a number of reflections that point towards a new reading of the problem of governability in Mexico after Independence.
Cultural Studies	Turkish television has seen the diversification of themes and genres in both fictional and factual programmes reflecting the expansion of the television market in the 2000s. As well as thematic television channels, various television shows on cooking and food are currently on air in Turkey. These cookery programmes not only introduce and re-invent' local recipes from different regions of Turkey but also promote particular lifestyles and consumption patterns for the audience. However, in the case of Turkey, cookery programmes draw comparisons between Islamic and secular lifestyles through combining religious tales with personal stories, local ingredients with global recipes and suggested housework strategies for producing tasteful food. This article examines Kitchen Love, a cookery programme presented by Emine Beder, one of the pioneers of culinary consumption as a form of popular culture. Both Emine Beder's public persona and her show frame food and cooking as part of an Islamic identity that negotiates Islamic values in relation to modern lifestyles and patterns of consumption.
Anthropology	The betel nut trade in Papua New Guinea is big business. Betel nut, a mild indigenous stimulant, is considered the green gold of the grassroots'. It is the country's most significant domestic cash crop and, in terms of rural incomes, a rival to the dominant export cash crops. Its sale is an important livelihood strategy in both rural and urban areas, the most visible manifestation of a flourishing informal economy. In betel nut marketplaces money flows' and overflows', traders wield large wads of cash, and vast sums change hands. Whether seeking their fortunes or only tinned fish, people trade betel nut first and foremost to make money, but such interests in trade do not automatically displace other forms of value. This paper is concerned with marketplaces and trade in contemporary Papua New Guinea and what is conveyed in those transactions between buyer and seller. Against the often impersonal and utilitarian rendering of trade, this paper seeks to foreground the sociability of trade and the multiple forms of value that may be simultaneously attached to monetised market transactions. This is not to conceal the discrete, unenduring, and competitive dynamics of trade, which prominently feature in many betel nut transactions, but instead to examine an important dynamic often overlooked. Market transactions, far from being asocial, or even socially destructive, have the capacity to generate and sustain diverse social relations including those of kinship and friendship.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area of research, but little attention has been given to how social and ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an agent-based model is used to explore potential 'learning dilemmas', or barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents manage water according to different management strategies and use various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however, agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies. When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they relate to water management.
Management	In the wake of recent financial scandals and in the context of the global financial crisis, corporate governance is especially significant. We examine the effect of corporate governance practices on the performance of 106 mid-sized firms in India, between 2005 and 2007. Our results confirm a significant relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. We also find that a small board is more effective and enhances the value of the firm. However, in the Indian context, we find that non-executive independent directors are failing in their monitoring role.
Economics	Using Korean firm-level data, this paper studies the effects of knowledge spillovers on knowledge production and productivity growth. Data from 213 Korean firms for the years 1985 to 2007 are used, and the number of patent applications is used as a proxy variable for knowledge. The results show that all the growth rates of output, patents, and productivity are higher in high-technology firms. Regression results show that the spillover effect on knowledge production and productivity growth is very significant, and that the spillover effect is larger in small firms than in large firms. Moreover, spillover effects on productivity growth are larger after 1995, when Korean intellectual property rights were strengthened. Our findings suggest that the effects of knowledge spillover on productivity are positively correlated with strong intellectual property rights.
Ethnic Studies	Lyons's essay traces the origins of the Fonds d'action sociale (FAS), an agency that has been at the centre of French efforts to 'integrate' immigrants, mostly from the former colonial empire, for nearly forty years. Established in 1958 just after the founding of the Fifth Republic, the FAS was an umbrella agency that funded social welfare programmes that exclusively served Algerians in the final years of French rule, and later expanded its services to all immigrants and their descendants. From the outset, the FAS brought together personnel and techniques developed on both sides of the Mediterranean, and relied heavily on private charitable institutions that provided specialized services intended to help Algerians 'adapt' to their new environment. Central to this project was the hope that welfare services would simultaneously provide evidence that France was committed to 'integrating' Algerians, improving their material conditions and effectively monitoring them in order to root out those associating with the Algerian independence movement. Historicizing the role played by the FAS in French 'integration' politics is essential to understanding the process of decolonization and the legacy of colonialism in metropolitan France. This study of the FAS demonstrates, in concrete terms, how the republic and the empire were intimately intertwined. It rejects the notion that the imperial and republican projects were separate ventures, with the former representing a deviation from the otherwise universalist principles of the latter, and argues that this state institution was both republican and imperial, when it was created to solve the 'Algerian crisis' and when it was reframed to manage the 'immigration problem' after Algerian independence in 1962.
Education, Special	The presence of the Internet in society has raised a growing interest in the potential benefits and risks of this tool and its consequences in certain groups like students with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perceptions about the behaviours conducted by this population and the ability of these professionals to prevent and/or manage potential risks on the Internet for this group. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on a survey design in which 258 Spanish teachers participated. Descriptive and nonparametric analyses were performed to examine and compare teachers' responses. Findings indicate that, according to respondents, students with intellectual disabilities frequently connect to the Internet, mainly to watch videos or films, listen to music and socialise with friends. They also reveal the presence of unwanted online behaviours that this group has experienced or engaged in. Teachers report they are not sufficiently prepared or have received the necessary training to prevent and/or manage these risks. However, they have put into practice active mediation strategies to prevent them. Significant differences were found in teachers' perceptions based on teaching level and teaching position. The need to implement training plans is recommended.
Public Administration	This article explores variations in housing outcomes in European Union member states that are measured in terms of the quality and affordability of accommodation. It reveals marked north/south and east/west inter-country variations in the outcomes considered. These variations are related to differences in housing inputs and outputs which are analyzed with reference to Esping-Andersen's (1999) distinction between the three main societal institutions that provide welfare services - states, markets and households. This analysis indicates that poor housing outcomes are associated with reliance on a single driver, i.e. state, market or household. Reliance on multiple drivers - states and markets for instance - is associated with better housing outcomes. However, household-driven housing systems, whether associated with another driver or not, generally result in poor outcomes.
Sociology	"The purpose of this article is to analyze the (re) definitions that occurred in the differential management of illegalities in Rio de Janeiro favelas since the Pacifying Police Units were launched. Based on an ethnographic fieldword carried out in the first two ""pacified"" favelas, I mapped out the UPP's outcomes on the modalities of presence, modes of action, and interaction between police and youth engaged in the illegal drug trade. I defend the hypothesis that monitoring, negotiating and confronting are the main modalities for the management of illegalities in Rio de Janeiro favelas. And I suggest that analyzing variations and combinations of these modalities is fundamental to understand the force fields that are set in ""pacified"" favelas and, consequently, to analyze the process of rise and fall of the UPPs."
Area Studies	Is the shift in regime identification from the Chinese government to the Taiwanese government a universal phenomenon among Chinese students in Taiwan? This article examines and finds evidence of Chinese students' political attitudes by conducting a two-wave survey based on the political socialisation approach. The results indicated that the regime identification of Chinese students on a scale of -10 to 10 was, on average, 0.68 higher four months after their arrival in Taiwan than when they first arrived. The regression model developed in this study accounted for 34.37 per cent of the variance in the degree of shift in students' regime identification. Seven of the eight formulated hypotheses were also supported.
Linguistics	This paper introduces a method for the analysis of regional linguistic variation. The method identifies individual and common patterns of spatial clustering in a set of linguistic variables measured over a set of locations based on a combination of three statistical techniques: spatial autocorrelation, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. To demonstrate how to apply this method, it is used to analyze regional variation in the values of 40 continuously measured, high-frequency lexical alternation variables in a 26-million-word corpus of letters to the editor representing 206 cities from across the United States.
Public Administration	Human and material resources allocation and its effects on public elementary schools' performance in Mexico reveal priorities that are not always explicit on education policies. In addition, those resources interact with families' social context and students' educational lag. The combined effects of these factors are analyzed on schools' performance by using the results obtained by schools on the standardized test enlace of 2012. Heterogeneity of schools is considered by its decil ranking, and a model is estimated to build indicators that group the effects of resources and context on schools' performance through a quintile regression. Relevant results show, on one hand, that students' lag condition schools' performance and, on the other hand, that public schools compensate for social and scholar disadvantages.
Management	This article examines the potential use of e-human resource management (e-HRM) as a means to increase the value of the human resources (HR) function, within the framework of the resource-based view. Past research has suggested that e-HRM may support the HR function in becoming more efficient, improving service delivery and adopting a greater role in delivering the firm's business strategy. The results from a large-scale survey across 12 countries showed that e-HRM may help HR to increase its value by becoming more strategic, but found no evidence of cost savings due to reductions in HR headcount. This suggests that organisations are using e-HRM in order to redeploy HR practitioners from transactional work to more strategic and value-added activities.
Sociology	"The paper takes smart specialisation strategies as the point of departure and frame of reference for the discussion of innovation policies and regional innovation systems. It aims to demonstrate that the regional innovation systems approach, representing a dynamic perspective on innovation and learning in the promotion of international competitiveness and economic growth, is an instrumental policy tool for the design and implementation of smart specialisation strategies. Moreover, the paper discusses different types of new path development, especially emphasising development paths that represent transformative activities in the form of path diversification based on unrelated knowledge combinations and new path creation, and how such path development can be achieved. The paper argues that such new path development, implying increased complexity of technology and knowhow but low relatedness, does not constitute a ""casino strategy"" as argued by Balland et al. (Balland, P.-A., et al. 2017. ""Smart Specialisation in the EU: Relatedness, Knowledge Complexity and Regional Diversification."" Papers in Evolutionary Economic Geography, Utrecht University.), but a transformative activity or long jumps with the potential of ""generating new options for subsequent structural transformation"" (Hidalgo, C. A., B. Klinger, A.-L. Barabasi, and R. Hausmann. 2007. ""The Product Space Conditions the Development of Nations."" Science 317: 482-487). As such these radical forms of new path development should be in the scope of policy makers even if they represent ""high risk/high benefit"" alternatives. The analytical framework is applied on a moderate innovative, Eastern European region (Mazovia) of the EU."
Environmental Studies	Rural development policy reforms and necessary institutional adjustments are of particular importance in overcoming the transitional challenges for the Western Balkan countries, whose economies are highly dependent on agriculture. The complex rural development context in these countries triggers the need for better understanding and explaining of the factors influencing the use of rural development policy funds. The research aim is to identify how the behavioural determinants and some socio-economic characteristics influence farmers' intention to apply for rural development support (RDS). The analytical framework is based on the theory of planned behaviour and structural equation modelling by using farm survey data collected in Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2014. The results suggest that the success of RDS depends on farmers' underlying psychological constructs. The intention to use RDS funds is stronger with farmers with positive attitudes (in all three countries), support from the social environment (in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina) and higher perceived behavioural control (in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia). Prior experience with applying for RDS funds has positive effects on forming farmers' intention to apply for RDS, while the influence of age, education and perceived farm profitability on the behavioural determinants is less pronounced. Investigating the farmer's behaviour in these Western Balkan countries provides novel insights that could be used for related policy strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Development Studies	In this paper, I use a novel approach to estimate Sierra Leone's aggregate capital stock from gross fixed investment and depreciation. Using Johanssen's maximum-likelihood cointegration methodology, I then estimate the parameters of the country's long-run per capita aggregate production function. Thereafter, the sources of economic growth are calculated, the key finding being that economic growth in post-independence Sierra Leone has been propelled by mostly capital accumulation. The implications of this capital-driven growth on poverty reduction and income distribution are then discussed. Policy recommendations for how to simultaneously promote economic growth and improve the living standard of the average Sierra Leonean are also provided.
Business	This paper aims to predict the relationship quality (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) of a customer with a Spanish saving bank by using both the quality of service operations and the usage of e-banking, on the relationship quality (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) of a customer with a Spanish saving bank. A competitive strategy follows testing three alternative models employing PLS path modeling with a primary dataset obtained through both an online survey and internal bank databases of almost one thousand customers. This study includes the predictive validation of models using hold out samples and testing for casual asymmetry. The results indicate that both the quality of service operations and the customer's use of e-banking successfully and independently contribute to predict the customer's relationship quality. The face-to-face service encounter is still the major contributor of relationship quality, but the use of e-banking tools also improves the relationship quality of customers in the banking industry. This model is consistent across a multi-group of customers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Management	Adopting an institutional lens, this paper examines the interaction between different levels of legal, normative and cultural-cognitive institutions on the level of innovation associated with the choice of alliance governance mechanism as equity or contractual. Using patent data, this paper undertakes multilevel modelling of 314 technology alliance portfolios located in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Key findings indicate normative and cultural-cognitive institutions do affect the performance outcomes of alliances. Equity alliances provide supporting mechanisms that quell fears about organizational risk in alliances under conditions of uncertainty avoidance as the dominant cultural-cognitive frame, and hence contribute to better innovation performance. Contractual alliances are associated with higher levels of innovation under normative contexts that value collectivism rather than individualism. Contrary to expectation, the results do not support the literature of a fit between equity alliances and weak intellectual property rights protection on innovation. However, the presence of highly formalized legal processes for enforcing contracts is associated with higher levels of innovation from alliances.
Education, Special	Both Canada's and Germany's school systems are transitioning into inclusive education systems. This transition is also happening in vocational schools. This paper addresses the new demands that vocational teachers face, due to the introduction of inclusive education in Germany and Canada, by examining Canadian and German pre-service vocational teachers' attitudes, self-efficacy and experiences related to inclusive education. The study identifies significantly more positive ratings in the Canadian sample across all the three scales. We conclude that the different ratings relate to different school systems, experiences with inclusion and the teacher education systems. Based on these research findings, recommendations for teacher education are discussed.
Urban Studies	"Existing jobs-housing balance studies have relied heavily if not solely on small data. Via a case study of Shanghai, this study shows how cellular network data can be processed to derive useful information, job and housing locations of commuters in particular, for those studies. Based on cellular network data, this article quantifies and visualizes Shanghai""s jobs-housing balance with a much larger sample (n = 63 million), finer spatial resolution and greater geographic coverage than ever before. It identifies and geocodes the local commuters by Base Transceiver Station (BTS), which has on average a service area of 0.16 km(2). After detecting jobs and housing by BTS, it aggregates them by subareas of particular interest (e.g., traffic analysis zones, inner city, suburbs and exurbs) to local planners and decision-makers. It also visualizes the traffic flows associated with the actual (T-act), theoretical minimum (T-min) and maximum (T-max) commutes. It shows that Shanghai""s commuting pattern is far from the extremes (indicated by T-max and T-min traffic flows) and Shanghai""s relative balance of jobs with respect to housing is decent (3.2 km) despite its huge population (24 million) and land area sizes (6800 km(2)). The cumulative distribution of the Tact and Train flows vary more significantly when the commuting distance is less than 6 km. In theory, there is high concentration of both jobs and housing within a 6-kilometer radius across different locales of the city. This potentially allows over 95% of all the local workers to find a job within 6 km of his/her residence or vice versa. In reality, a much lower percentage (71%) of workers can enjoy such a benefit. This can imply that there is qualitative mismatch between jobs and housing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Criminology & Penology	The amount of social scientific knowledge about rural violence pales in comparison with that of urban violence, and even less is known about the situational contexts of rural violence. Using National Crime Victimization Survey data, we explore situational contexts of rural violence in general, as well as compare male- and female-perpetrated violence contexts. Results indicate that the contexts of violence committed by females are characterized by main effects (i.e., no weapons, no injuries across a variety of contexts), while male-perpetrated violence is highly contextual. An important finding emerged from studying contexts associated with male offenders and female victims-in every dominant context with one exception, male perpetrators were engaged in woman abuse. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to rural violence and variation in how this violence is perpetrated.
History	This fable places the Michoacan female revolutionary dancers in dialogue with the renowned Mexican poet Octavio Paz, allowing the women to reveal to him key aspects of the cultural worlds they helped devise, aspects they embodied in their illicit dance in the church. Most particularly, the fable trains Paz in Mexican female temporality, a temporality they recalibrated as they danced.
Urban Studies	Using Florida survey data from 2002 and 2007, this article seeks to determine the characteristics of local governments that make them more or less inclined to engage in smart growth-related land-use regulations. The study draws on a range of theoretical traditions to motivate an empirical model of policy adoption, emphasizing the interaction between interest group politics and local political institutions as the primary explanatory factors. In addition, the article differentiates between types of smart growth regulations designed to promote a key smart growth principle-compact development-in terms of their redistributive consequences. The study finds some support for the notion that the adoption of smart growth practices is affected by the activism of interest groups and their interaction with local political institutions.
Gerontology	ObjectivesTo evaluate longitudinal trends in the use of total hip arthroplasty (THA), hemiarthroplasty (HA), internal fixation (IF), and nonoperative management and to identify individual-level factors associated with nonoperative treatment of hip fracture (HF). DesignLongitudinal analysis of administrative data. SettingManitoba, Canada. ParticipantsAll adults who experienced nontraumatic hip fractures between 1990 and 2014 (N = 19,626; mean age 80.6, 72.3% female). MeasurementsBilling codes were used to identify surgical treatment, and trends in treatment over time were examined. Regression models were developed to identify individual factors associated with receiving nonoperative management. ResultsUse of THA increased from 0.6% for all HFs in 1990-94 to 5.3% in 2010-14, use of HA increased from 19.3% to 29.7%, and use of IF declined from 71.8% to 59.9% (P < .001 for all); increase in THA and HA were largest in individuals with femoral neck fracture. Nonoperative management declined from 8.3% in 1990-94 to 5.1% in 2010-14 (P < .001). Factors associated with nonoperative management included aged 90 and older, male sex, residing in a care facility before fracture, and rural residence. ConclusionHF is increasingly treated with THA and HA, whereas rates of nonoperative management and IF are declining. Future efforts should focus on ensuring that all individuals are optimally triaged to the best procedure for them, with nonoperative management considered for individuals with extremely poor prefracture health.
Transportation	This research investigates the design and impact of a new travel demand management approach, namely the Downtown Space Reservation System (DSRS), using a microscopic traffic simulation approach executed in VISSIM. The DSRS is part of a Travel Demand Management strategy that is designed to mitigate traffic congestion in a downtown urban setting. The simulation is conducted according to an experimental design procedure for a revised road network representing downtown Boise, Idaho. The issues that are tested in the simulation include: (1) whether the DSRS improves traffic performance when compared with the case without the DSRS; (2) how the DSRS performs compared with a reservation system that uses a First Come First Serve principle; and (3) how the specific DSRS parameters (such as, the relative importance of throughput versus revenue generation) influence network system performance. Conclusions and future research recommendations are provided based on the insights from the simulation modeling work.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) has become famous, and perhaps infamous, for many reasons. Presently, he is probably most widely-known for his paintings of plants and animals in his very popular book, Art Forms in Nature, originally collected and published in 1904. However, in addition to Haeckel's art, he is also well-known for his advocacy of Darwinism and Social Darwinism, for first coining the term 'ecology,' for having his work utilized by Nazi pseudo-scientists (Dombrowksi in Tech Commun Q 12:303-319, 2003), and for famously (perhaps fraudulently) producing drawings of animal and human embryos so as to confirm his biogenetic law (Gould in Nat Hist 109:44-45, 2000). Something Haeckel is not as well-known for today is the fact that he seemed to be both a strenuous critic of the metaphysical and moral philosophies of Immanuel Kant and yet also something of an adherent to Kant's aesthetic views. In terms of metaphysics and morality, Haeckel sought to exorcise Kant's ideas as much as possible from twentieth century views on science, humanity, and nature; however, in terms of aesthetic theory, Haeckel seemed to embrace a distinctly Kantian approach to art and artworks. This essay proposes to: (1) carefully examine Haeckel's refutations of some of Kant's central metaphysical concepts, (2) explore some of the, arguably Kantian, assumptions underlying Haeckel's approach to aesthetics and his artistic practice, and (3) combine these two lines of inquiry into a portrait of Haeckel's mind as one that is conflicted about the role Kantian philosophy, and more specifically Kantian noumena, should play in twentieth century science and art. This unresolved tension in Haeckel's mind regarding Kant's noumenal realm is what I propose to call his 'Kant Problem'.
Environmental Studies	This paper investigates the spatial effects of liquidity factors on housing market performance. We adopt the spatial panel approach to address spatial dependency and the spillover effect among neighboring housing estates. Using a special transaction database from the Economic Property Research Centre (EPRC), the results show that a higher housing liquidity level leads to a lower subsequent housing return, while the contemporary return increases with unexpected liquidity shock. Specifically, a 1% rise in the housing liquidity level leads to a 1.85% fall in the expected housing return in the following year, and a 1% unexpected liquidity shockwould raise the contemporary housing return by 3.33%. Moreover, the results reveal strong spatial spillover effects of liquidity shocks in the Hong Kong housing market. This paper delivers useful implications for both policy makers and practitioners regarding spatial dependency and contagion among housing markets. The research framework and spatial approaches can be easily replicated and applied to other cities and regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Management	Most experts agree that human resource management plays a critical role in furthering ethics. The human resource management function can play an instrumental role in creating an ethical culture. However, a literature review shows that researchers have mostly ignored ethics in the African context. Given the growing importance of Africa in terms of global trade, it is critical to study ethics on the continent. This paper documents an exploratory study of ethical climates in sub-Saharan Africa. We develop propositions linking key social institutional factors, i.e. ethnic diversity and corruption, with three types of ethical climate, i.e. self-interest, benevolence and principle. The propositions are empirically investigated using a qualitative case study approach in five companies in Nigeria and South Africa. The results provide varying support for these propositions and highlight the critical role that both the national context and the organizational context play in shaping ethical climates in companies. Furthermore, given the role of human resource management in managing both ethnic diversity and ethics, we discuss the implications of our results for this critical management function.
Development Studies	The global aid world has changed, partly in response to the reconfigurations of geopolitical power and to the global financial crisis (GFC). Paradoxically, in the face of recession in most northern economies, collectively foreign aid contributions have not fallen. However there has been a qualitative shift in its narrative and nature. This new regimewhich we term retroliberalismprojects the concept of shared prosperity, but constitutes a return to explicit self-interest designed to bolster private sector trade and investment. Drawing evidence from New Zealand and the United Kingdom, we argue that aid programmes are increasingly functioning as exported stimulus packages.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	We discuss the kinds and degrees of competence that the ethnographer needs to acquire. We consider the unique adequacy postulate, proposed by ethnomethodologists, that suggests that in the study of esoteric or specialized domains, the researcher needs to acquire or have previously acquired competence themselves. We suggest that this deserves more critical and nuanced scrutiny, not least given the impossibility of having prior competence in all aspects of a complex organization or activity. We also suggest that we need a more delicate appreciation of types of competence and, hence, of ethnographic knowledge. There is no single prescription, but a more thorough appreciation of the sociology of knowledge will inform ethnographic practice and methodological commentary.
Rehabilitation	It is becoming increasingly apparent to rehabilitation and health researchers that employment is linked to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions including those with fibromyalgia (FM). This study evaluated relationships between employment status and HRQOL outcomes in adults with FM (N=198). This study found employment, both full- and part-time, significantly predicted a number of health-related outcomes. Participants especially those with full-time employment had the least amount of secondary health conditions and better overall functioning, HRQOL, and life satisfaction in comparison to participants without employment. Therefore, rehabilitation health professionals should consider offering health promotion and vocational rehabilitation interventions to people with FM to help them stay at work for as long as possible
Political Science	Should journals review submissions based only on the research question and research design, independent of whether the results are statistically and substantively significant? This special issue is the first effort in political science (and perhaps across the social sciences) to publish articles based on submission of research designs alone. We offer our thoughts on the process.
Urban Studies	"Laws restricting the behaviors of homeless people in public places are proliferating. Proponents argue that such ""quality of life"" laws will encourage homeless people to move off the streets and into services, and thereby improve their quality of life. Critics argue that these laws target vulnerable individuals and show little evidence of improving the lives of homeless people. To inform this debate, this article reports data from two separate surveys of Colorado homeless residents regarding their experiences with quality of life policing, supplemented by a review of police data regarding contacts, ticketing, and arrests of homeless people. The data reveal that the oft-stated goal of improving the quality of life of homeless residents through ""tough love"" policing campaigns has not been met. Instead, most homeless residents report their lives have become more challenging, more stressful, and less safe following expansion of quality of life policing."
Social Issues	"The paper presents the results of an empirical research of youth attitudes toward cohabitation. The study included 825 respondents divided into two subgroups - 717 male and female students of different faculties at the age of 18-30 years and 108 unemployed young people the same age, none of whom was married at the time of the research. The results show that more than a half of the respondents believe that a couple can live together even if they do not intend to get married, that it is advisable to live together before marriage to determine the compliance of future spouses, that cohabitation is not associated with subsequent marital dissatisfaction, infidelity or divorce, that cohabitation is prevalent. among people who are more liberal and less religious, and they perceive it as a usual way of starting the first union and as trial marriage. Although the majority of respondents agree with the thesis that cohabitation is a freer way of life than marriage, they do not consider it as ""living in sin"", which is the best indicator of the openness of young people to alternative family groups and acceptance of premarital cohabitation as a stage of the marriage process. The attitudes of men and women toward cohabitation do not Offer significantly, except at the level of individual particles, with women being more prone to considering cohabitation as a trend, as opposed to men for whom cohabitation is definitely a better choice than the single life. The study showed significant differences in the attitudes of students toward cohabitation, depending on the faculty where they study, with the greatest differences expressed by the students of the Catholic Faculty of Theology who express significantly more negative attitudes toward cohabitation than all other students in all tested claims, and the students of the Academy of Arts who have much more positive attitudes toward cohabitation than other students in this study."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Fertility clinics (and some employers) in the UK and other high-income countries have recently started to offer egg freezing to women concerned about their age-related fertility decline. Because the use of egg freezing for this purpose is new, there is no reliable evidence of its usefulness, or otherwise. There are no guarantees that egg freezing will work, and for many and perhaps most women, their frozen eggs will never be used. It is also unclear whether egg freezing is a positive development for women in general. It offers an additional choice, and it may enable some women to have genetically related children more easily in the future. At the same time, it could be argued that egg freezing individualises and medicalises the social problem of a mismatch between female fertility and when women and men feel ready to have children. This article suggests that egg freezing is an ambiguous technology, whose benefits are as yet speculative, and that women therefore need as much clear and frank information as possible in order to navigate this new and by no means straightforward choice.
Transportation	Most airline revenue optimization models assume capacity to be fixed by fleet assignment, and thus treat it as deterministic. However, empirical data show that on 40% of flights, capacity is updated at least once within the booking horizon. Capacity updates can be caused by fleet-assignment reoptimizations or by short-term operational problems. This paper proposes a first model to integrate the resulting capacity uncertainty in the leg-based airline revenue management process. While assuming deterministic demand, the proposed model includes stochastic scenarios to represent potential capacity updates. To derive optimal inventory controls, we provide both a mixed-integer program and a combinatorial solution approach, and discuss efficient ways of optimizing the special case of a single capacity update. We also explore effects of denied boarding cost and the model's relationship to the static overbooking problem. We numerically evaluate the model on empirically calibrated demand instances and benchmark it on the established deterministic approach and an upper bound based on perfect hindsight. In addition, we show that the combinatorial solution approach reduces the computational effort. Finally, we compare the static overbooking approach derived from the capacity uncertainty model to existing approaches based on the expected marginal seat revenue (EMSR).
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	"In this article, we introduce lassopack, a suite of programs for regularized regression in Stata. lassopack implements lasso, square-root lasso, elastic net, ridge regression, adaptive lasso, and postestimation ordinary least squares. The methods are suitable for the high-dimensional setting, where the number of predictors p may be large and possibly greater than the number of observations, n. We offer three approaches for selecting the penalization (""tuning"") parameters: information criteria (implemented in lasso2), K-fold cross-validation and h-step-ahead rolling cross-validation for cross-section, panel, and time-series data (cvlasso), and theory-driven (""rigorous"" or plugin) penalization for the lasso and square-root lasso for cross-section and panel data (rlasso). We discuss the theoretical framework and practical considerations for each approach. We also present Monte Carlo results to compare the performances of the penalization approaches."

Ethnic Studies	In the Israeli public sphere we often hear claims about offences to religious feelings. For example, representatives of the three major religions have argued that having a gay pride parade in the holy city of Jerusalem offends their religious feelings. The debate about allowing motor traffic during the Sabbath on Bar-Ilan road, which is located in a Jewish ultra orthodox neighbourhood in Jerusalem, is another example in which claims about offences to religious feelings were raised. According to the orthodox view in current liberal thought, there should be no legal protection from mere insult to feelings and sensibilities, as related to sacred religious and cultural values as they may be. The Israeli legal doctrine is a unique exception. It acknowledges claims about offences to religious feelings. It is not based, however, on a comprehensive theoretical framework in political and moral philosophy. In this article, I draw on the Israeli example and argue - against the prevailing liberal orthodoxy - that some claims of offence to feelings deserve legal protection. I argue that such claims boil down to a struggle for equality in the public sphere between competing cultural identities. I conceptualize such claims from offences to feelings as claims that purport to protect one's right in the integrity of one's cultural identity. I argue that from this conceptualization a principle for justly regulating claims from cultural identity emerges. This is the vulnerable cultural identity principle, according to which the more vulnerable the social and civic status of one's cultural identity is, the stronger one's claim is to integrity of cultural identity. The vulnerable identity principle recognizes the asymmetrical social power relations between minority and majority members. It is entailed by the notion of toleration, which requires the state, according to certain conceptions of toleration, to take active steps to ensure equal recognition of different cultural identities.
Economics	Foreign multinationals often not only export but also control local firms through FDI. This paper examines the various effects of trade and industrial policies when exports and FDI coexist. We focus on the case in which a foreign firm has full control of a local firm through partial ownership. Cross-border ownership on the basis of both financial interests and corporate control leads to horizontal market linkages through which tariffs and production subsidies may harm locally owned firms but benefit the foreign firm. Foreign ownership regulation benefits locally owned firms. These results could have strong policy implications for developing countries that attract an increasing share of world FDI.
Cultural Studies	"The paper offers a brief but hopefully clarificatory account of the three language families generally referred to by linguists as Southern African Khoisan, and outlines ongoing and unresolved linguistic debates concerning relationships between the three families. The need is emphasised for linguists to move away from pre-theoretical assumptions based on the colonial construct of ""race"", and-in the context of investigating diachronic language change-to include consideration rather of the social status of different speaker communities in relation to one another."
Social Work	In recent years, various professional associations in social work and regulatory bodies worldwide have engaged in ambitious efforts to draft and implement comprehensive ethics guidelines, standards, and education. For a variety of complex reasons, the social work profession in India has lagged behind developments in many other nations. The purpose of this article is to assess the current status of social work ethics in India, review relevant developments throughout the world, and present a blueprint to guide the development of much-needed indigenous ethical standards and education in India.

Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This paper outlines the state of the art in qualitative longitudinal methodology, reflecting on more than 10years of development since a previous special issue on qualitative longitudinal research was published by the International Journal of Social Research Methodology in 2003. The papers presented in this special issue emerge from a methodological innovation network that brought together an international community of researchers in order to map new frontiers for the method. This paper summarises the development of the method from a design to a sensibility, identifying three new frontiers as part of a future research agenda including: the need for a processual imaginary; experimentation with temporal perspectives and orientations and explicating the temporal affordances of our methods.
Linguistics	Language performance assessments typically require human raters, introducing possible error. In international examinations of English proficiency, rater language background is an especially salient factor that needs to be considered. The existence of rater language background-related bias in writing performance assessment is the object of this study. Data for this study are ratings assigned by Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB) raters to compositions written by examinees of various language backgrounds. While most of the raters are native speakers of English, four have first languages other than English: two Spanish, one Korean, and one bilingual speaker of Filipino and Chinese (Amoy). Examinees were divided into 21 language groups. The IRT application FACETS was used to estimate and control for rater severity when calculating the amount of bias reflected by each rater's set of ratings for each language/language group. Results show that the magnitude of bias terms for all raters for all language groups was minimal, thus having little effect on examinee scores, and that there is no pattern of language-related bias in the ratings.
Linguistics	Topic management by non-native speakers (NNSs) during informal conversations has received comparatively little attention from researchers, and receives surprisingly little attention in second language learning and teaching. This article reports on one of the topic management strategies employed by international students during informal, social interactions with native-speaker peers, exploring the process of maintaining topic continuity following temporary suspensions of topics. The concept of side sequences is employed to illustrate the nature of different types of topic suspension, as well as the process of jointly negotiating a return to the topic. Extracts from the conversations show that such sequences were not exclusively occasioned by language difficulties, and that the non-native speaker participants were able to effect successful returns to the main topic of the conversations.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The classification of novel disease events is central to public health action surrounding them. Drawing upon the sociology of scientific classification, this article examines the role and contestation of the World Health Organization's Pandemic Alert Phases, as applied to the spread of 2009/10 H1N1 Influenza. The analysis of World Health Organization texts, including policy documents, public statements and epidemiological documents, has been utilized to examine the Organization's actions and public narratives around the event of H1N1. Analytically, the functional role of such classificatory schemes and the social construction of scientific classifications are examined. It is argued that in understanding the World Health Organization's 2009/10 application of the Pandemic Alert Phases, the critical limitation of the functions served by the classificatory scheme led to the breakdown of its construction. This case study highlights the importance of classification for the successful production of scientific facts', the constructed nature of classificatory systems and the potential for contestation that arises when such classifications do not adequately fulfil their functional roles.
Linguistics	"""Hybrid"" nouns are known for being able to trigger either syntactic or semantic agreement, the latter typically occurring outside the noun's projection. We document and discuss a rare example of a Hebrew noun that triggers either syntactic or semantic agreement within the DP. To explain this and other unusual patterns of nominal agreement, we propose a configurational adaptation of the concord-index distinction, originated in Wechsler and ZlatiA double dagger (2003). Morphologically-rooted (=concord) features are hosted on the noun stem while semantically-rooted (=index) features are hosted on Num, a higher functional head. Depending on where attributive adjectives attach, they may display either type of agreement. The observed and unobserved patterns of agreement follow from general principles of selection and syntactic locality."
Urban Studies	Cities, like any complex adaptive systems, may become increasingly fragile if not properly managed. To date, the literature has focused primarily on the examination of cities within fragile countries. This has resulted in a dearth of studies that have looked at how developed (or even advanced) cities that operate in relatively stable countries and/or environments might allow unresolved issues to accumulate in the city: degrading its ability to function. Studying fragility in developed cities is a worthwhile undertaking given their economic, social, and political significance. This paper puts forth a conceptual framework to understand the nature of fragile cities in the developed world. Our framework frames fragility as a function of unresolved fractures of social compacts that degrades a city's ability to function over time and stress exacerbates its effects. Drawing on over two dozen incidents from developed cities, we ground the framework and illustrate its value.
Family Studies	Recent conceptual and in-depth research discussions have seen a shift away from use of the term 'family', towards ideas focusing on personal life, intimacy and kinship. In this article we argue for retention of the concept. We consider the implications of this conceptual withdrawal in terms of family researchers' ability to engage with how families are invoked in ever-intensifying ways in the public political, and the importance of being able to address how this interacts with and shapes everyday family lives and experiences.
Management	The study of bargaining power and its role in negotiations has a long history in operations management research. Much of this research has involved buyer-supplier exchanges and has often hinged on the assumption that powerful firms negotiate to wield (fully) their power for favorable outcomes. Yet, it is unclear to what extent firms transform their potential power into realized power. Building on insights grounded in resource dependence theory and literature on competitive dynamics and organization design, we theorize that structural factors (i.e., decentralization, spheres of influence, and mutual dependence) constrain firms from fully realizing their potential power. In doing so, we center on a more nuanced context-multimarket buyer-supplier exchanges, wherein buyers and suppliers handle multiple exchanges across different product markets. We use two controlled negotiation experiments to test our hypotheses. Our results show that in multimarket exchanges, three key factors (and how they sometimes interact) constrain power use. These results offer boundary conditions to extant theory. Most profoundly, our results reveal that centralization (traditionally viewed as a structural lever toenhancepower use) alone does not affect power use but has distinct effects conditional on other factors-countering theory and challenging best practices in industry.
Public Administration	This study examines how media coverage impacts the interaction between industries and regulatory agencies in the United States. We examine Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rulemaking and airline industry comments during 71 notice and comment periods between 1996 and 2005. This study's findings shed light on how external forces such as media coverage create conditions in which organized industry interests can impact regulatory outcomes. Specifically, this study's findings suggest that the amount of media coverage received by the FAA is associated with the level of firm participation in the notice and comment process. In addition, the results indicate that greater media scrutiny is associated with longer comment periods as well as an increased likelihood of proposed rules being modified.
History Of Social Sciences	Social scientists have mostly taken it for granted that William Foote Whyte's sociological classic Street Corner Society (SCS, 1943) belongs to the Chicago school of sociology's research tradition or that it is a relatively independent study which cannot be placed in any specific research tradition. Social science research has usually overlooked the fact that William Foote Whyte was educated in social anthropology at Harvard University, and was mainly influenced by Conrad M. Arensberg and W. Lloyd Warner. What I want to show, based on archival research, is that SCS cannot easily be said either to belong to the Chicago school's urban sociology or to be an independent study in departmental and idea-historical terms. Instead, the work should be seen as part of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown's and W. Lloyd Warner's comparative research projects in social anthropology.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	This article addresses health promotion and prevention of drug use, reviewing approaches and conceptualizations without specifying determinate classes of drugs and their licitness or illicitness. The objective of this paper is to describe the prevention of drug use and to raise pertinent aspects of drug abuse for the construction of a health promotion strategy. As refers to drug use, Brazil has invested in the formulation of policies for health promotion, protection and recovery, however humanized, inter-sectorial, decentralized, integrated, democratic and active approaches need to be implemented. This review shows the need for more discussions about the prevention of drug use involving educators, parents and the community, in a structured multiple process integrating and involving institutions and sectors in the co-responsibility to promote the health of the population in this sense. This article also shows our concern with finding ways that contribute to the implementation of public policies as refers to drug addiction.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Using data from interviews and collective agreements in five European countries, this article analyses the relationship between collective bargaining and the minimum wage. In a context of changing minimum wage policy and competing government objectives, the findings illuminate how pay bargaining strategies of trade unions and employers shape the pay equity effects of minimum wage policy. Two general forms are identified: direct responses to a changing national minimum wage, and responses to the absence or weakness of a national minimum wage. The article explains how particular intersections of minimum wage policy and collective bargaining, together with country and sector contingencies, shape the form of pay bargaining and pay equity outcomes.
Ethnic Studies	In the immediate aftermath of German reunification, as in the wake of the recent humanitarian crisis, Germany experienced notable 'peaks' of racist agitation and violence. In the 1990s, as today, the post-Communist eastern regions of Germany tend to be perceived as the hub of such racism. In this article, Lewicki revisits both 'peaks' via an examination of numerical evidence for verbal and physical racist violence in the former East and West of Germany. Rather than conceiving of racism as 'cyclical' or a specific legacy of the Communist dictatorship, her analysis suggests that political projects in Germany's past and present have retained distinct structural incarnations of race. Far-right activists could thus successfully channel animosities resulting from the terms of unification into nationalist and racist resentment: momentarily more so in the East, but increasingly also in the West. The politics of citizenship, Lewicki argues, has provided a key means of perpetuating, reaffirming and cementing racialized hierarchies in the two post-war German states, but also in reunified Germany.
Gerontology	BackgroundBraden score is a routine assessment of pressure ulcer risk hypothesized to identify the frail phenotype. ObjectivesTo investigate the predictive utility of the Braden score on outcomes of inpatients with heart failure (HF). DesignRetrospective cohort study. SettingAn academic medical center between January 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013. Participants642 inpatients with a primary diagnosis of HF (ICD-9 428). MeasurementsThe primary predictor was Braden score. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Additional outcomes included 30-day readmission, length of stay (LOS), and discharge destination. Multivariable methods were used to determine the association between the primary predictor and each outcome adjusted for patient demographics and clinical variables. ResultsMean admission and discharge Braden scores were 19.5 2.3 (SD) (range = 9-23) and 20.0 +/- 1.9 (range = 11-23), respectively (P < .0001). Mean age was 61.8 +/- 16.2 years (range = 19-101). The 30-day mortality rate was 4.4%, 30-day readmission rate was 16.2%, mean LOS was 7.0 +/- 8.7 days, and 78.2% were discharged home. After adjustment, higher (better) Braden score was significantly associated with decreased 30-day mortality (discharge Braden AOR 0.81 (95% CI 0.66-0.996)), and decreased average LOS (admission Braden -0.52 days (P = .0002)). Higher discharge Braden score was significantly associated with discharge to home (AOR 1.66 (95% CI 1.42-1.95)). Braden score was not significantly associated with 30-day readmission. ConclusionBraden score is an independent predictor of mortality, LOS, and discharge destination among inpatients with HF. Further exploration of the use of Braden scores to identify inpatients who might benefit from specialized intervention is warranted.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Version 2.01 of the BLS Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System enables researchers to more readily identify factors that contribute to construction industry fatalities and provide the industry with insight into developing injury prevention strategies; the revision improves on current safety and health surveillance and will have long-term effects on safety and health intervention programs and policies targeted at both the construction industry and the overall U.S. workforce.
Substance Abuse	Introduction and Aims: Socioeconomic Status (SES) is considered as one of the important factors associated with use of various drugs. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of SES on cigarette smoking, alcohol use, drug use, and passive exposure to opium and cigarette smoke. Design and Methods: In this study, which is part of a multicenter case-control study, the research hypothesis was checked among controls who had referred to hospitals. Data were collected through a questionnaire and laboratory tests to determine the actual consumers of opium and other illicit drugs. Then, the data were analyzed using STATA 13. Result: This study was performed on 364 individuals within the age range of 30 to 75 years. More than 55% of the participants had a history of life-time consumption of cigarettes and hookah as well as alcohol and drugs. The results revealed an inverse relationship between SES and life-time consumption of hookah and alcohol. Furthermore, individuals with higher SES were more likely to deny their drug use. Discussion and Conclusions: The results revealed little robust evidence supporting the assumption that SES level can have an important effect on illicit drug use. On the other hand, the participants' characteristics could have a prominent effect on precise evaluation of the relationship between SES and drug use. Further multicenter studies are needed with samples diversified in terms of age and ethnicity to identify these confounding relationships.
Industrial Relations & Labor	At the end of the Third Way and no sense of its future, social democrats look to Sweden for inspiration. However, Swedish social democracy is in no better condition. Scholarship is starting to grasp the broad outlines of the movement's difficulties. Providing greater depth, this article employs the Social Systems of Innovation and Production approach to analyse Swedish social democracy's current condition by historicising its current policy dilemmas in relation to the public pension system, once the jewel in the crown of the Rehn-Meidner model and the push for economic and industrial democracy, now the constraining legacy of financialisation.
Social Issues	In the past decade, the cognitive science of religion has worked to find an evolutionary explanation for supernatural belief. The explanations are convincing, but have created the stereotype that atheism is unnatural. In a similar way studies linking religious belief and health have vilified atheism as unhealthy. But belief is too complex, health is too nuanced, and the data are too varied to draw such a generalization. Catherine Caldwell-Harris has developed a psychological profile to understand nonbelief as an expected outcome of individual difference and therefore natural. In a similar manner I argue that we should study the relationship between belief and health through the lens of individual differences. This approach is especially promising given recent research which indicates personality fully accounts for the relationship with well-being previously attributed to belief. This approach has the added benefit of neutralizing the conversation by understanding atheism as the healthy expression of a natural personality.
Demography	This research studies the reproductive contributions of Taiwan's foreign wives from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, based on applications of the multinomial logit model to the micro data of the 2003 Census of Foreign Spouses. The wives from China are found to have the lowest lifetime fertility of 1.4 children, mainly because they were more prone to marry later, have a very large spousal age gap, be separated or divorced, and have their current marriage as their second marriage. The effect of wife's educational attainment on lifetime fertility turned out to be either modest or nonexistent.
Social Work	A promising new field of research examines racial disparities within the criminal legal system and reveals how mass incarceration contributes to already-existing social inequalities. This essay reviews three books that considerably advance this field: Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship, by Charles R. Epp, Steven Maynard-Moody, and Donald P. Haider-Markel; A Pound of Flesh: Monetary Sanctions as Punishment for the Poor, by Alexes Harris; and Crook County: Racism and Injustice in America's Largest Criminal Court, by Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve. These books draw on the experiences of people directly affected by US crime control policy to reveal the precise mechanisms that produce and sustain racial disparities in arrests, sentencing, and the administration of court fines and fees, while speaking to the broader implications of mass incarceration for race and citizenship in the United States.
Economics	Globalization has brought about fundamental change. But, the same theory that shows that free trade is beneficial also shows that globalization can be harmful to at least one of the trading countries. Moreover, with globalization, the interests of a country and its companies may diverge. In this paper, we examine free trade in a globalizing world and identify the key policy issues that economists and industrial leaders, alike, must address in today's interdependent world.

Industrial Relations & Labor	This article focuses on changes in collective bargaining in Spain during the current phase of austerity. We evaluate how the decentralization and transformation of collective bargaining have affected industrial relations and forms of work and suggest that the policy reforms have led to a deterioration in working conditions and a weakening in collective regulation and trade unions. However, we emphasize the contradictory outcomes, which appear to be drawing the state into new more direct roles, bringing new actors (such as legal firms) into the deregulation of employment. This situation also raises a range of concerns among managers and employers at the repoliticization of industrial relations and generates further challenges to the ability of management and unions to sustain consensual forms of social dialogue.
Ethics	This article argues for a novel approach to the measurement of freedom of choice, on which the availability of an option is a matter of degree, rather than a bivalent matter of being either available or not. This approach is motivated by case studies involving weakness of will, where deficiencies in willpower seem to impair individual freedom by making certain alternatives much harder to pursue. This approach is perfectly general, however: its graded analysis of option availability can be extended to cases where weakness of will is not involved and can be used to generalize numerous existing measures of freedom.
Criminology & Penology	Despite recent research demonstrating the impact of inmate perceptions of correctional legitimacy on order maintenance, the extant literature has failed to examine the contextual reality of correctional excessive use of force claims. Utilizing legal cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals and U.S. District Courts, this article examines correctional officer excessive use of non-deadly force and identifies recurring themes in these claims. Findings highlight the common occurrence of retaliatory violence, negative attitudes, failure to listen to inmate concerns, inadequate training, and an inability to decipher reliable threat cues consistently present in correctional officer use of non-deadly force claims. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are offered.
International Relations	Governments across the Middle East and South Asia are increasingly losing power to substate actors that are inserting themselves at a mezzanine level of rule between the government and the people. Western policymakers must address the problem systematically, at both a political and a legal level, rather than continue to pursue reactive and disjointed measures on a case-by-case basis.
Rehabilitation	Introduction: In 2009, the United Kingdom Department of Health identified the need to assist families so that people with dementia can remain living at home. Occupational therapists could support families and their loved ones at home by understanding the human occupational impact of caregiving. This impact includes how one is influenced by values and motivated to perform activities shaped by experiences and life roles. The purpose of this review was to synthesize qualitative research related to family dementia caregiving, extrapolating information about the human occupational impact on the caregiver. The aim was to inform occupational therapy practice. Method: A search was conducted across a range of electronic databases. A quality appraisal tool was specifically developed for the study appraisal and data extraction process. Data were extracted and analysed within the Model of Human Occupation framework. Findings: Twenty studies were included in this review. Five themes emerged: adapting to dementia; staying motivated and in control; preserving occupational balance and wellbeing; gaining meaning from the caregiver role; and losses and burden. Conclusion: The human occupational impact of caregiving affects the quality and decision-making of care for families. Occupational therapists are well placed to support families through the stages of dementia.
Economics	The literature on entry into marriages has almost universally regarded a high body mass index (BMI) to be a disadvantage for women in the marriage market. But the theoretical effect of BMI on marital entry is actually uncertain because women who anticipate poor outcomes in the marriage market are more likely to accept early offers, while women with more desirable characteristics can afford to wait for a better match. Using data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we show that female entry into marriage does decline as BMI rises, but that early marriage is nonlinear in BMI. Women with an extremely high BMI or with a BMI in the most attractive range are less likely to marry early.
Cultural Studies	How are social relations and ethno-religious identifications of pre-war Syria remembered and narrated by Syrian refugees in exile? Crossing the abyss of war, and negotiated through the shifting times and sites of forced displacement, this article addresses Syrian refugee narratives as discursive practices that attempt to reclaim an irretrievably lost terrain. The metaphor of a 'paradise lost' is an unmistakable component of the Syrian refugees' stories, illustrating multiple understandings of 'paradise' in which memories of the past gain a particularly idealized character. At the same time, however, and to some extent belying this metaphor, there are traces of tension-filled undercurrents that call for a plural reading of the past. Discussed within a theoretical framework of memory, metaphors and religious identifications, the empirical analysis highlights two narrative themes: (1) coexistence and diversity: narratives of intercultural and inter-religious relations and (2) living under authoritarian rule: narratives of fear and compliance. Leading up to the revolution and subsequent civil war, these narratives display the ambivalent ways in which Syrian refugees conceptualize the past.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	LifeGene, a biobank and research infrastructure, is Sweden's largest biomedical project. Designed for research on gene-environment interactions, the project aimed to collect data and biological samples from 500 000 individuals. The directors pointed to Sweden's universal health-care system, national registries and pro-science citizenry as indicative of the nation's unique suitability for this ambitious project. As researchers explained, in Sweden, large-scale national collection of personal data has generally proceeded with little debate. In this view, the historical legacy of social engineering and close ties between science and the state has led to a popular sense of trust in the state to collect and use information in the best interest of the population. However, LifeGene is more than just a continuation of information-gathering-as-usual in a country where the government has long kept track of its population's health and social characteristics. With LifeGene, the construction of surrounding research infrastructures, and a reworking of national data protection legislation, Swedish researchers and authorities are now purposely building a framework for moving from data-as- usual to Big Data and the Big Value it promises to deliver. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with Swedish researchers and data managers, this article will examine the legal, social and infrastructural challenges of Sweden's bid for Big Data.
History	This article considers the role of missionaries in constructing memorials to the Majimaji sites at Mikukuyumbu, Nyangao, and Maposeni in southern Tanzania. The Majimaji war is one of the most important events in the history of Tanzania as the first attempt for freedom from colonial domination. Although the government of Tanzania constructed the National Majimaji Museum, it has failed to commemorate all battle sites with built memorials. On the other hand, missionaries have constructed memorials in all the areas where bishops, priests, and nuns were killed during the Majimaji war. Missionary memorials have been used by Southern Tanzanians-missionaries, Christians, and non-Christians. Thus, the analyses of the missionary Majimaji memorials and the use of the memorials by both missionaries and the people of southern Tanzania provides a picture of how battle sites are memorialized by different agents.
Education, Special	Parental perceptions of the importance of friendship development in comparison to other outcome priorities are examined in this research. Parents of children with high functioning autism between the age of 5-10 years (N = 74) were asked to rate and rank the importance of the following six outcome priorities: friendship, social skills, physical and motor development, intellectual and academic skills, creativity, and emotional capacity. It was predicted that friendship would be highly prioritised by parents, considering the friendship difficulties often experienced by children with autism. Parents reported friendship to be third most highly rated outcome following social skills and emotional skills, although all three were closely rated. When parents were asked to force-rank priorities, friendship was ranked considerably lower than social and emotional development. Level of autistic symptomatology of the child did not seem to influence parent rating or ranking of friendship importance to any great extent. The implications of these findings for future educational service delivery are discussed.
Communication	As agenda-setting theory moves toward its 50th anniversary, its productivity in the past and at present augurs a highly promising future. In this essay, the original theorists trace the development of agenda setting and identify seven distinct facets. They explore three of the seven facets-need for orientation, network agenda setting, and agendamelding-in greater detail because those are particularly active arenas of contemporary research. Grounded in more than 40 years of productive collaboration among the authors, this inaugural Deutschmann Scholars Essay offers numerous new ideas about recent trends in and future directions for agenda-setting theory and research. The three authors are all recipients of AEJMC's Paul J. Deutschmann Award for Excellence in Research recognizing a career of scholarly achievement. The Deutschmann scholars observed that this may well be the most original article they have ever written together.
Cultural Studies	This article focuses on the development of portrait busts of saints beginning in the early Renaissance. The category of the portrait bust, which emerged slightly before 1440, is characterized by its reference to-and at times even integration of- the death mask of the recently deceased saint. As such, these images must be seen in close relation to traditional head and bust reliquaries. The particular group of busts showing the features of the Florentine archbishop Antonino Pierozzi is here analyzed through hitherto obscure written sources, and the proliferation of Pierozzi's bust is then related to that of other saints.

Education, Special	The effects of (a) private room, (b) typical classroom, and (c) high-distraction room test settings were examined on the math test performance of six college students (four females) with ADHD. Participants (aged 18-30 years) completed multiple, equivalent algebra calculation tests (100 items each) under the three test-setting conditions. A multi-element design was used to compare the number of items attempted (test access) and percentage correct (accuracy). Students also rated their level of distraction after each testing session on a Likert-type scale. Results showed that students found the high-distraction setting more distracting than other settings and that five of six students accessed more test items in the private room versus the high-distraction setting, with three of the six demonstrating nonoverlapping data across settings. A regular classroom setting did not produce a high level of distraction, nor did it restrict student access to the math tests relative to a private room setting. These findings suggest that some students with ADHD are affected negatively by highly distracting environments and may benefit from a quiet, private test setting. Single-case experimental designs may be useful for examining individual differences among students with disabilities receiving specific test accommodations.
Communication	The purpose of this study was twofold. On the ground of Gerbner's cultivation theory, it examined the effect of South Korean drama consumption on the perceived prevalence of single life and having fewer children in married life. It also tested the causality of cultivation effects through a priming methodology. Results indicated that the perceived prevalence of having fewer children in married life was significantly affected by exposure to dramas which positively feature single life and having fewer children in married life on television. The findings provide public health policy-makers and communication campaigners with valuable theoretical relationships, as well as their practical implications.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to add to the literature on Taiwanese policing in three regards: employing multiple measures of satisfaction with police services; including analysis of the effects of differing neighborhood contexts; and examining both individual and district-level measures simultaneously to deepen our understanding of influences on citizen satisfaction with police services. Design/methodology/approach Data for the study were obtained from a random-stratified sampling telephone survey of 1,806 residents in metropolitan Taipei, which is located in the Northern part of Taiwan Island, during May of 2014. Given the fact that these residents were nested in 41 districts in metropolitan Taipei, hierarchical linear modeling was employed to examine the effects of both individual and district-level factors on satisfaction with police services simultaneously. Findings Results indicate that, among neighborhood context variables, mean levels of victimization, fear of crime, and perceived disorder erode citizen satisfaction with police. In contrast, collective efficacy produces a positive effect on the perception of police performance after controlling for demographics. With respect to those district-level variables, citizen/police ratio, the total crime rate/100,000 habitants, and the average of household income significantly impact public assessment of police services. Originality/value Only limited empirical research has examined neighborhood context effects on residents' satisfaction with policing services, and virtually no such research has been carried out by examining individual and contextual-level factors at play simultaneously in Taiwan. This research fills this gap.
Business	Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful.
Law	We introduce the concept of embedded legal activity to capture the ways in which lawyers and legal organizations can become intertwined in the ongoing activities of social movements. Embedded legal activity is characterized by diverse issues and venues and comprises legal activities that help support movement infrastructure, close coordination between movement lawyers and other activists, and responsiveness to constituent needs. Investigating a comprehensive data set on legal activity during the southern civil rights movement, we identify forms of legal activity beyond the typical focus of legal mobilization, including defense for movement participants charged with misdemeanors and other crimes, movement assistance on organization-level legal matters, and general legal aid to movement constituents. These were by far the more common types of legal activity and emerged from the embeddedness of lawyers in a mass movement. We argue that embedded legal activity is likely where movements prioritize grassroots leadership and community organizing and face significant countermobilization, hostile legal and political opportunity structures, and substantial social and economic inequality.
Linguistics	This paper describes an examination of academic consultation discourse using an applied genre analytic approach (Bhatia 2002a) to inform English for academic purposes curriculum design and to contribute to interactional pragmatics and politeness research. The project employed a series of complementary genre and corpus-informed analyses, namely contextual (Tribble 2002), phase (Agar 1985), and interactional moves analysis (Swales 1990) focused on the use of framing (e.g. Goffman 1974), in conjunction with contrastive corpus analysis (Granger 1998). Data for the analyses originated in the office hours sub-corpus of MICASE (Simpson et al. 2002), and a spoken learner corpus of international teaching assistants in training (Reinhardt 2010). Results are interpreted using a model of directive language use in academic consultation discourse that considers appeals to choice and involvement as complementary rather than conflated. The genre of office hours emerges from the negotiated textualization of directive moves, framed around directive constructions using interactional politeness appeals.
Nursing	The wide adoption of electronic medical records and subsequent availability of large amounts of clinical data provide a rich resource for researchers. However, the secondary use of clinical data for research purposes is not without limitations. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to identify current issues related to secondary use of electronic medical record data via MEDLINE and CINAHL databases. All articles published until June 2018 were included. Sixty articles remained after title and abstract review, and four domains of potential limitations were identified: (1) data quality issues, present in 91.7% of the articles reviewed; (2) data preprocessing challenges (53.3%); (3) privacy concerns (18.3%); and (4) potential for limited generalizability (21.7%). Researchers must be aware of the limitations inherent to the use of electronic medical record data for research and consider the potential effects of these limitations throughout the entire study process, from initial conceptualization to the identification of adequate sources that can provide data appropriate for answering the research questions, analysis, and reporting study results. Consideration should also be given to using existing data quality assessment frameworks to facilitate use of standardized data quality definitions and further efforts of standard data quality reporting in publications.
History Of Social Sciences	Ideas about the difference between rural and urban areas are woven into the fabric of English society. This paper asks how two different campaigns against urban expansion and rural homebuilding in England - one interwar and one more contemporary (related to the production of the National Planning Policy Framework' document) - represent the difference between rural' and urban' and how they use these representations to justify and naturalize their arguments. Utilizing interpretive textual analysis to compare the two periods, we show that, whilst planning has undergone significant paradigm shifts during the period between the two campaigns, in both archives a dominant rural idyll' is (re)produced and reinforced through the representational themes of beauty, nature, purity, an elite educated class, and a traditional social order. This is strongly contrasted to the representation of the urban sphere' as an unnatural, ugly, modern, and socially fragmented dystopia. Urban' areas are therefore constructed as the constitutive Other' to the rural idyll. In this way, the apparently natural urban characteristics associated with built-up areas are represented as out of place' within the rural sphere. These representations work to justify the argument that development' is a threat to the intrinsic characteristics of the countryside and should not be allowed to take place. This rural idyll/urban dystopia binary is argued to continue to have an important influence on shaping policy debate.
Ethnic Studies	This piece introduces the overarching themes of the special issue. It maps the current intellectual landscape, and describes the disconnect between a lot of influential academic research on cultural and religious diversity and political reality. It argues that the rise of anti-immigration and anti-diversity sentiments in many democratic states around the world renders conventional arguments for multiculturalism inapplicable in these states, and calls for a re-appraisal of these theories in order to assess their feasibility and persuasiveness. It outlines the contributions to the special issue, and analyses the themes on which they touch.
Transportation	Waiting, whether for services, for someone, or for something, is an inescapable part of life. This paper addresses a gap in the waiting time literature by examining previously sparsely studied relationships between individual- and travel-related characteristics and attitudes toward waiting using a revealed preference dataset of Northern California commuters (N = 2617). Correlational analyses, followed by a trivariate seemingly unrelated regression equations model, are developed for three waiting attitudinal constructs: general tolerance toward waiting, and attitudes toward equipped and expected waiting. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, time use perceptions and preferences, personality traits, multitasking attitudes (polychronicity), commute preferences and expectations, and general attitudes (e.g. pro-technology) are all seen to have significant effects on waiting attitudes. As this survey was executed on commuters, it also facilitates a unique simultaneous exploration of travel and wait time attributes, time uses that are often similarly viewed in day-to-day life. From this perspective, we see that longer commute times and distances are correlated with negative attitudes toward waiting, while commuters with pro-transit, pro-density, and pro-active transportation attitudes tend to have positive attitudes toward waiting. Additionally, we see that those with preferences for multitasking in general or at their jobs can tolerate waiting better. Overall, this study constitutes a distinctive contribution to the waiting time literature, capitalizing on a rich dataset to make important connections between related time uses and a multitude of other variables-key among them polychronicity, with its potential ability to reduce the negative perception and experience of waiting. Findings from this study may also benefit transportation and other service providers by facilitating an understanding of how various consumer groups/demographics view waiting, thus enabling providers to better cater to diverse needs/populations.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Introduction: In 2014, the National Cancer Institute conducted the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating Study (FLASHE). This parent and adolescent survey examines psychosocial; generational (parent-adolescent); and environmental (home and neighborhood) correlates of cancer-preventive behaviors, with a particular emphasis on diet and physical activity. This paper describes the FLASHE data collection methods and enrollment and response rates. Methods: FLASHE data collection methods included web-based surveys delivered to dyads of parents and their adolescent children, and deployment of accelerometers to a subset of adolescents, to achieve study goals in a nationwide study sample. The National Cancer Institute contracted with Westat, Inc. to recruit, enroll, and collect the data using a consumer opinion panel. Results: A total of 5,027 dyads were screened for eligibility, and 1,945 (38.7%) enrolled. Of fully enrolled dyads, 85.6% of those in the Survey-Only group completed all four surveys, and 58.7% of dyads in the Motion Study group completed all surveys and were compliant with the accelerometer protocol for adolescents. The overall study response rate was 29.4%; 1,479 dyads completed all study procedures. The majority of parents were female, whereas the adolescent sample was gender balanced. Data were analyzed in 2015-2016. Conclusions: FLASHE recruited a large sample of parent-adolescent dyads. Although challenges for research in parent-adolescent dyads include enrolling a diverse sample and having multistep enrollment and consent processes, study completion rate was high among fully enrolled dyads. Future panel studies may consider approaches used in FLASHE to encourage study enrollment and completion.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The purpose of this study is to identify the organisational capabilities that complement the adoption of a proactive environmental strategy, and the specific benefits that can arise from such a strategy. The study focuses on developing countries that depend heavily on the tourism industry, but where environmental problems challenge the future of this industry. The study proposes that learning orientation, innovativeness, and quality management positively affect the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. Based on empirical data from hotels in Thailand, PLS-SEM was applied to explore these relationships. The results confirm the hypotheses but also show that the green strategy positively affects environmental performance and organisational competitive advantage. More specifically, green strategies lead directly to positive environmental performance in terms of the consumption of utilities, waste management, and environmental risk management, leading to cost competitiveness and competitive advantage through differentiation.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Philosophy of biology is often said to have emerged in the last third of the twentieth century. Prior to this time, it has been alleged that the only authors who engaged philosophically with the life sciences were either logical empiricists who sought to impose the explanatory ideals of the physical sciences onto biology, or vitalists who invoked mystical agencies in an attempt to ward off the threat of physicochemical reduction. These schools paid little attention to actual biological science, and as a result philosophy of biology languished in a state of futility for much of the twentieth century. The situation, we are told, only began to change in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a new generation of researchers began to focus on problems internal to biology, leading to the consolidation of the discipline. In this paper we challenge this widely accepted narrative of the history of philosophy of biology. We do so by arguing that the most important tradition within early twentieth-century philosophy of biology was neither logical empiricism nor vitalism, but the organicist movement that flourished between the First and Second World Wars. We show that the organicist corpus is thematically and methodologically continuous with the contemporary literature in order to discredit the view that early work in the philosophy of biology was unproductive, and we emphasize the desirability of integrating the historical and contemporary conversations into a single, unified discourse.
Women'S Studies	"Healthy girls with early puberty are sometimes given gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) to delay their pubertal development until they reach an average age of onset. Feminist research has called this treatment into question, arguing that age at puberty should be seen in terms of diversity rather than normality and abnormality. In support of this feminist position, it is argued that treatment has been justified by an ideology that medicalises healthy girls to make them ""normal."" This core objective has been linked to increasing final height, reducing psychosocial difficulties, delaying sexual activity and reducing the risk of abuse. All of these auxiliary treatment objectives have been justified by being fitted to evidence rather than tested against it, and all are problematic. Side effects of GnRHas, including reduced IQ have not been properly addressed, the alternative of providing girls with support has been little considered, and the rights of the girls are not recognised.

Business, Finance	"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit the special issue of Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal published in 1996 on the theme ""Accounting history into the twenty-first century"", in order to identify and assess the impact of the special issue in shaping developments in the accounting history literature, and to consider issues for future historical research in accounting. Design/methodology/approach - A retrospective and prospective essay focusing on developments in the historical accounting literature. Findings - The special issue's advocacy of critical and interpretive histories of accounting's past has influenced subsequent research, particularly within the various research themes identified in the issue. The most significant aspect of this influence has been the engagement of increasing numbers of accounting historians with theoretical perspectives and analytical frameworks. Research limitations/implications - The present study examines the content and impact of a single journal issue. It explores future research possibilities, which inevitably involves speculation. Originality/value - In addressing recent developments in the literature through the lens of the special issue, the paper emphasises the unifying power of history and offers ideas, insights and reflections that may assist in stimulating originality in future studies of accounting's past."
Business, Finance	When is a foreign stock a better buy than its ADR?
Sociology	Khat (Catha edulis) is a perennial bush originating in East Africa. This shrub's leaves and twigs are sold in East African and Middle Eastern markets for their narcotic effect. Khat has become an exceedingly popular topic in both the health and policy arenas, with a growing body of literature related to cardiovascular and oral health, mental health and cognitive processes, and monitoring and policy related to khat. However, there has been relatively little research on khat's association with food security, which is foundational to human health and well-being, or its place in the agrifood system. Furthermore, research linking khat to validated cross-cultural measures of food security is nonexistent. The majority of studies contextualizing khat production in terms of food security focus on khat's displacement of food crops. This study surveyed 115 farmers in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Data revealed khat to be positively associated with food security. However, there is reason for caution given the documented potential for poor health outcomes related to khat consumption and the heavy reliance on irrigation for intensive khat production, combined with the unregulated nature of water withdrawals in Ethiopia. Poor health and degradation of water and soil resources are key vulnerability pathways in community resilience.
Linguistics	This study investigated the second language acquisition of resolutions of the argument dependencies of verbs. The investigation adopted an emergentist approach, assuming that acquisition is item-based and construction-based. The paper investigated argument dependencies that are resolved in complex constructions and by pragmatic interpretation. The data were from a longitudinal case study of a 12-year-old Spanish learner of English, Ana, who wrote stories describing 15 different wordless picture books during a 201-day period. The findings indicate that Ana began by producing only a few types of complex constructions that were lexically-selected by a small set of verbs. Gradually, she produced an increasingly large range of constructions. Ana also gradually increased the complexity of her language in terms of the serial use of dependent clauses and phrases. By the end of the study, she may have developed linguistic abilities that can be described as grammaticalized, generalized linguistic constructions or automatic processing routines.

Rehabilitation	Purpose Sexual difficulties post-stroke are common, yet frequently neglected within rehabilitation. This study aimed to explore the process by which healthcare professionals approach and work with the topic of sexuality within stroke rehabilitation. Method Ten participants were recruited from 5 community and inpatient multi-disciplinary stroke rehabilitation teams. Semi-structured interviews were carried out and data were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Results The authors developed a theoretical model of how professionals engage with sexual concerns. Professionals' own personal level of comfort with the topic of sexuality interacted with a series of barriers to limit opportunities for engagement. These barriers included factors relating to the context and workplace environment of stroke rehabilitation, professionals' perceptions that they did not have adequate skills in this area and unhelpful attitudes towards stroke survivors and sexuality. Although the majority of participants rarely engaged with sexual issues, they adopted both direct and indirect strategies for engaging with their service users' sexual concerns. Concerns were usually addressed through the provision of information and supportive conversations. Conclusions The findings suggest that sexuality is not a legitimised topic within stroke rehabilitation, and current work practises limit professionals' abilities to address service-users' concerns. Implications for developing effective training and staff support are discussed.
Ethics	This paper contributes to the discourse on expatriate employment in developing countries. The aim is to determine whether or not the practice is morally objectionable and if so, to point out the most plausible way to account for the moral problem involved. In this regard, I examine four arguments, namely, that in developing countries, expatriate employment is morally wrong because it 1) entrenches the injustice of wage discrimination, 2) produces undesirable outcomes, 3) disregards contextual aspirations and historical memory and 4) is a tool of external domination and control. I analyse these arguments to show that they are insufficient accounts for the moral impropriety of expatriate employment in developing countries. To this end, I provide an outline of an argument I consider capable of accounting for the moral question in this context. This argument focuses on the notion that the moral problem of expatriate employment in developing countries is the unequal or arbitrary distribution of power among employees. The moral wrong in this, I argue, consists in the failure to respect the universal moral equality of people.
Management	Project governance is important in ensuring successful project delivery. In this article we conduct a systematic investigation of previous research to provide a content-driven review of the literature, and to provide future research direction. We use the textual data mining software Leximancer to identify dominant concepts and themes underlying project governance research. Our findings indicate that agency and stakeholder theories have been adapted to the project governance context to a greater extent than other theories. Furthermore, we find differences in project governance research, published in project management journals compared to general management, IT and engineering journals. We conclude the paper by presenting a framework that links governance theories to the multiple organizational levels relevant to project governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Demography	This article examines gender differences in employment status among immigrants in Israel, and how these differences vary across origin groups. Analysis of the 1995 population census indicates that, all else being equal, immigrant women exert a negative effect on activity in the annual labor force. As time elapses, the probability of immigrant women being employed improves but remains considerably lower than that of both immigrant and native-born men. However, after a few years in the country, immigrant women do close the gap with native-born women. For employment status in the last week, being an immigrant woman has a positive effect on full-time employment. A detailed analysis reveals substantial stratification by country of birth. Thus, the patterns of employment status for immigrant groups can reflect different levels (single, double, and triple) of disadvantage or advantage for women. I attach this stratification to cultural background and social values of country of birth as well as to economic and religious considerations, not fully indexed by the census data.
Public Administration	In recent years, public management research has made great strides in explaining the drivers of employee turnover in the public sector, with key findings related to the role of employee loyalty, organizational satisfaction, person-organization fit, and compensation. This article contributes to this growing body of literature by assessing the influence of a previously untested driver of employee turnover at the state level of government: public-private wage equity. Contrary to conventional wisdom, results suggest that public-private wage equity does not significantly influence voluntary separation rates, whereas state government unionization and the average age of state government employees are found to be indirectly related to voluntary separation. Results also point to the potential implications of ethnicity, gender, and public service motivation in state government employee turnover and provide key insights for those seeking to further understand the impact of reduced expenditures on public sector wages and shifting age distributions in public sector employment.
Social Issues	U.S.-based private and voluntary organizations (PVOs) play an important role in international assistance. To assess this role, the authors constructed a new data set that covers more than 1,600 secular and religious PVOs that registered with the U. S. federal government between 1939 and 2004. In the post-World War II period, major revenue patterns are the rise of Evangelical PVOs, decline of Jewish PVOs, and rapid growth of secular PVOs from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. The authors analyze the determinants of changes in PVO size, gauged by real revenue. They focus on the interplay between public revenue (from the federal government, international organizations, and other governments) and private revenue. Specifically, they investigate whether funds from the federal government and other public entities serve as a magnet for subsequent private support.
Environmental Studies	Gas extraction from the Groningen gasfield.in the northern Netherlands has led to localised earthquakes which are projected to become more severe. The social impacts experienced by local residents include: damage to property; declining house prices; concerns about the chance of dykes breaking; feelings of anxiety and insecurity; health issues; and anger. These social and emotional impacts are exacerbated by the increasing distrust Groningen people have towards the national government and the gas company, NAM, a partnership between Shell and ExxonMobil. The earthquakes have reopened discussions about the distribution of benefits from gas production and the Went to which benefits are retained locally. Mitigation of the impacts is attempted, but the lack of trust decreases the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. The extent of this experience of previously-unforeseen, unanticipated impacts suggests that a new social and environmental impact assessment needs to be undertaken, and a new Social Impact Management Plan (SIMP) and Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA) developed, so that the project can regain its legitimacy and social licence to operate. In addition to conventional gas, this paper has wider relevance for unconventional gas developments, for example shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing methods (fracking).

Urban Studies	For assessing the performance of urban infrastructures over long time horizons of 30-90 years, urban development models are desirable that explicitly represent the physical layout of the city, while confining model complexity to an appropriate level. Such models have recently appeared in the literature, but parameters were often defined ad-hoc or without documentation. This paper presents approaches to derive important parameters for such models based on commonly available data. We apply logit regression models considering four high-level characteristics of the urban landscape (distance from main station, accessibility to motorway, accessibility to marine and green spaces) to predict location of urban development for different building types, estimate characteristic building footprint and floor space areas for different building types depending on their location in the city, derive building coverage ratios using Voronoi polygons and estimate the number of buildings in new developments using hierarchical clustering. The applicability of all methods is demonstrated in a case study in Odense, Denmark. The derived parameters are case-specific, while the methods can easily be transferred to different case studies.
History Of Social Sciences	Leon Jaussely (1875-1932) was considered by his contemporaries as a forerunner and one of the most outstanding French planners of his time. He had a remarkable professional career in France and took part in several important international planning competitions. Jaussely's work, in many respects, is central to better comprehend both the evolution of urban planning and planner's exchanges at the beginning of the twentieth century. However, his significant role can only be fully understood from a transnational perspective. This paper aims, first, to analyse Jaussely's distinctive approach to cities and urban planning. Secondly, it intends to place his ideas within the transnational debate and examine his connections with British, American, and German planning. His role as a passeur culturel in the diffusion and adaptation of planning international principles in France is then discussed, showing how this study can contribute greatly to the research on cross-national exchanges and the transnational circulation of planning models at the beginning of the twentieth century. Finally, insights on Jaussely and the French town planning movement can provide a deeper understanding about historical alternatives to modernist architecture, and therefore highlight continuities between nineteenth and twentieth century practices.
Demography	In a further contribution to recent investigations of the relevance of genetic processes for demographic outcomes, we investigate genetic associations with whether adolescents use contraception. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that variants in the dopamine transporter gene DAT1, the dopamine receptor gene DRD2, and the monoamine oxidase gene MAOA are associated with unprotected sexual intercourse. Consistent with previous analyses of these data, the genotypes DRD2*A1/A2, DRD2*A2/A2, DAT1*9R/10R, and MAOA*2R/ are associated with higher odds of unprotected sexual intercourse than other genotypes at these loci. The DRD2 associations apply to both men and women, whereas the other associations apply to women only. These results are robust to controls for population stratification by continental ancestry, do not vary by contraceptive type, and are consistent with previous research showing that these genetic variants are associated with higher rates of impulsivity.
Education & Educational Research	Although concept maps have been used as alternative assessment methods in education, there has been an ongoing debate on how to evaluate students' concept maps. This study discusses how to evaluate students' concept maps as an assessment tool before and after 15 computer-based Predict-Observe-Explain (CB-POE) tasks related to acid-base chemistry. 12 high school students participated in this study. Students' concept maps were evaluated taking into account three parts: qualitative, quantitative and representational level. The results gathered from the quantitative analysis of the pre and post concept maps were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. The results showed that there is a significant difference between students' pre and post concept map scores (z = 3.05; p < 0.05). From the qualitative analysis of the concept maps, the majority of the students constructed their pre and post concept maps non-hierarchically; while they drew more interconnected concept maps after the CB-POE tasks. Regarding their representational level, the students used the macroscopic level more often than microscopic and symbolic levels in both their pre and post concept maps. Nonetheless, they increased the number of macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic level representations in their post concept maps. The paper concludes with suggestions and implications for educators and researchers to improve the quality of concept map evaluation.
Law	"The financial crisis of 2008 has led to dramatic changes in the way that finance is regulated: the Dodd-Frank Act imposed broad and systemic regulation on the industry on a level not seen since the New Deal. But the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided. Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself. These changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance. In particular, this Article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants. The Article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards."
Women'S Studies	The aim was to investigate women's accounts of the sources and explanations of perinatal anxiety to inform clinical and public health responses. Discussions with groups of women during admission to an early parenting service were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Twenty women participated (40% had above 'normal' anxiety symptoms; 45% were experiencing moderate or severe stress). The groups reported sources of worry about their babies, themselves and their relationships. These anxiety triggers were interpreted in the context of contemporary social and health discourses about pregnancy, the postpartum period and infant care. Five themes were identified: image management; single-message health promotion campaigns; evidence-based decision making, 'maternal instinct', and risk. Public health campaigns, health professionals and others could ameliorate perinatal anxiety by providing realistic, understandable, numerical information to assist decision making, disrupt inaccurate gender-based stereotypes about mothering behaviours and offer abundant praise for the work of mothering.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Addressing the issues examined in the introduction, this article suggests an integrative 'cultural biology of addiction', which aims at encouraging a continuing dialogue between neuroscientists and those engaged in social studies of addiction. This cultural biology of addiction provides an alternative framework that brings together seemingly contradictory social-constructionist and biologically reductionist claims about addictions.

Demography	The thriving of China's self-funded study abroad market is marked by the tremendous increase of students who use the services of educational intermediaries to facilitate their transnational journeys. This is largely due to the marketization of China's higher educational system and the liberalization of state policy towards commercialized brokerage services. Based on multi-sited fieldwork in China and Italy, this paper examines the intersections between the regulatory, the commercial, and the social dimensions of the educational migration infrastructure in China. It identifies a tension between the neoliberal ideas of individual autonomy and freedom, which are promoted by the state and private intermediaries, and the self-perpetuating nature of the educational migration infrastructure, which facilitates and constrains different groups of parents' and students' desire for international education.
Social Work	"Domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) is a rapidly growing problem in the United States, yet legislative efforts to address victim needs have begun only recently. DMST is an issue that spans several areas of social work practice, as emerging research shows that most children and youths exploited in commercial sex have typically experienced prior abuse, neglect, or other forms of trauma. Many have been involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems and are often lured by promises of love, security, protection, and belonging. Policy development to address DMST is still relatively new and evolving at both federal and state levels, but the general trend is to recognize such minors as victims rather than perpetrators of sex crimes. In this article the authors trace the development of legislation addressing DMST at the federal and state levels, with a particular focus on states' ""safe harbor laws"" that provide limited or total criminal immunity and a varying range of services to victims. Although space limitation precludes a detailed discussion of specific state laws, comparative analysis of representative provisions are discussed, highlighting social work application and further policy and research implications."
Gerontology	Hip fractures, fragility fractures, indicate an increased risk for further fragility fractures. Although the way to define osteoporosis, requiring antiresorptive therapy, is not clear, all patients who have had hip fractures should be prescribed calcium and vitamin D at a minimum. In a retrospective chart review, we have explored the effectiveness of incorporating a standing recommendation (but not a standing order) for calcium and vitamin D treatment in a hip fracture care pathway, comparing units where the pathway had been implemented with those where it had not yet been started. The pathway resulted in significantly more initiation of calcium and vitamin D compared to patients not on the pathway (72% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.01). However, a follow-up study after four years showed a marked decline in the frequency of the initiation of calcium and vitamin D, suggesting the need for ongoing encouragement for the intervention to continue to be successful.
History	Over the past two decades, a new phenomenon has emerged in secular kibbutzim, in which some members have adopted a religious way of life. Some of these newly religious (hozrim bi-tshuvah) choose to leave the kibbutz, but others, who are the subject of this article, decide to remain in the kibbutz, which continues to serve as the framework of their life. Based on observation and in-depth interviews with newly religious members of secular kibbutzim, this article discusses the array of dilemmas created by the transformation of their identity and the response to it on the part of kibbutz society. One of the dilemmas concerns the question whether their choice reflects a break with the kibbutz way of life or rather a link and continuity with this ideal. The article contributes to understanding both the changes in modern-day kibbutz society and the identity issues related to these changes.
Business, Finance	This research paper deals with the issue of introducing management control in Small and Medium sized Enterprises. To complete existing research in the field, this piece of research focuses on a socio-political perspective by using the framework of the Crozier and Friedberg strategic analysis (1977). The research is based on a case study which was carried out within a SME and mobilized two research methods of access to the field : action research followed by participatory observation. The analysis of 3 failures encountered by the company during the introduction of management control tools highlights inherent mechanisms to the development of management control within SME's. This proved that the interaction between the 3 strategic actors i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, the Chartered Accountant and the Chief Financial Officer determines the methods of introducing management control tools. The action of the CFO is perceived as a threat, which challenges the areas of uncertainty controlled by the two other actors and questions their power within the company.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Seasonal changes in mood and behavior have been reported among general population as well as among adolescents in the Northern hemisphere. The aim of the current study was to examine how the level of school well-being varies during the school year and how the seasonal effect shows on seventh, eighth and ninth grades. The data consisted of all lower secondary schools who used the theory based School Well-being Profile questionnaire during the school years 2007-2009 (N = 10,913) in Finland. Pupils perceived their well-being highest in three well-being categories (school conditions, social relationships, means for self-fulfilment) during the period lasting from middle of October until end of December. Health status was perceived lowest from the middle of March to the end of May. The level of well-being was highest among seventh graders and lowest among ninth graders. Pedagogical planning and health promotion interventions should be planned to strengthen the well-being of pupils especially at the end of the school year.
Cultural Studies	The South African Post Office and its proxies have been issuing postage stamps and related postal materials featuring rock art since 1931, first in South West Africa, later in the Republic of Venda, and subsequently in South Africa. Rock art has also appeared on stamps issued by many other countries across the world. In this broader context, the stamps can be seen as showcasing the cultural heritage of the issuing countries, but rock art has also been coopted and commodified for other purposes, such as political agendas or to promote philatelic sales. In the case of South Africa and its puppet states, the choice of image and the design of the postal materials have followed trends in the shifting status of the Bushman people and the way rock art has been viewed and understood.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	"Researchers and policy makers are increasingly dissatisfied with the ""average treatment effect.'' Not only are they interested in learning about the overall causal effects of policy interventions, but they want to know what specifically it is about the intervention that is responsible for any observed effects. In the U.S., using experimentally-designed evaluation to capture the average treatment effect is both commonplace and preferred practice; but, as this paper argues, there are many important questions yet to be asked and answered via our body of experimental research. As a reconsideration of Peck (2003), on the tenth anniversary of its publication, this article recasts earlier work on analyzing ""what works'' as a call to action for evaluators and policy analysts: we can and should do better."
Family Studies	We examined differences in family structure change in an urban sample of mothers (N = 1,314) from their child's birth to age 5 and whether ecological risk moderated this association. We found that compared with U.S.-born Latino mothers, foreign-born Latino mothers were 62% less likely to break up and 75% less likely to repartner than remain stably resident. Across nativity status, Latina mothers with fewer children, more economic stress, less income, and less frequently reported father involvement were more likely to break up and repartner than remain stably resident. We found no moderation effects of ecological risk.
Business, Finance	This paper studies the two potentially contrasting effects on IPO pricing and post-IPO operating performance of family ties as well as social ties the top management has with board members. While family ties may solve manager-owner conflicts of interests, they may also give rise to minority-shareholder expropriation and/or private benefits of control. Similarly, social ties may either create value or lead to entrenchment and excessive managerial power. Using q-analysis to measure the strength of top manager ties to board members, we find that IPO performance is positively related to the strength of social ties, but negatively to the strength of family ties. We also find that, controlling for social ties, board independence affects both IPO pricing and post-IPO operating performance. Further, we show that the association between IPO performance and ties depends on whether they are with inside or outside directors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Public Administration	Although art and politics are dealt within different departments, those are interlaced disciplines. It is remarkable that both art's decisiveness over politics and politics' decisiveness over art. Relating to this close relationship, one of the most important examples is Richard Wagner (1813-1883) who is one of the most significant composer of German opera. Wagner was not only a substantial authority in the field of music but also he became an ascendant person in the social and political area. Regarding, in this essay it is investigated how Richard Wagner's artworks and ideas influenced to 19th and 20th century political thought and how the political thought affected Wagner's artworks.
Law	"The article discusses when tit-for-tat enforcement, an important strategy in responsive regulation theory, may generate intended reactions in communities of regulatees. Combining insights from compliance motivation theory, responsive regulation theory, and ethnographic studies of compliance, I hypothesize that tit-for-tat enforcement's probability of success depends on regulators' institutionalized capacity to promote law-morality correspondence. Building such institutionalized capacity-so-called ""embeddedness""-simultaneously increases requirements for inspectorates' competence. This article addresses three forms of law-morality correspondence: moral support for the law's content, the legislator's authority, and harmony between legal and moral guilt criteria."
Criminology & Penology	This article considers the impact of international human rights law and standards on the protection of prisoners in the UK, with specific reference to the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Although prisoners do benefit from the protection of the Convention within prison, the scope of these rights will be limited by the needs of the prison administration as well as the political climate and the public's attitude toward prisoners. The conflicts between these variables are addressed. Respect for prisoners' rights, it is argued, may contribute to raised prison standards and to good order in prison.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"While thinking about the notion of the ""global"" in the history of the history of science, this essay examines a related but equally basic concept: the idea of ""Western science."" Tracing its rise in the nineteenth century, it shows how it developed as much outside the Western world as within it. Ironically, while the idea itself was crucial for the disciplinary formation of the history of science, the global history behind this story has not been much attended to. Drawing on examples from nineteenth-century Egypt and China, the essay begins by looking at how international vectors of knowledge production (viz., missionaries and technocrats) created new global histories of science through the construction of novel genealogies and through a process of conceptual syncretism. Turning next to the work of early professional historians of science, it shows how Arabic and Chinese knowledge traditions were similarly reinterpreted in light of the modern sciences, now viewed as part of a diachronic and universalist teleology ending in ""Western science."" It concludes by arguing that examining the global emergence of the idea of Western science in this way highlights key questions pertaining to the relation of the history of science to knowledge traditions across the world and the continuing search for global histories of science."
Information Science & Library Science	Objective: Case management programs for high-need high-cost patients are spreading rapidly among health systems. PCORNet has substantial potential to support learning health systems in rapidly evaluating these programs, but access to complete patient data on health care utilization is limited as PCORNet is based on electronic health records not health insurance claims data. Because matching cases to comparison patients on baseline utilization is often a critical component of high-quality observational comparative effectiveness research for high-need high-cost patients, limited access to claims may negatively affect the quality of the matching process. We sought to determine whether the evaluation of programs for high-need high-cost patients required claims data to match cases to comparison patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study design with multiple measures of before-and-after health care utilization for 1935 case management patients and 3833 matched comparison patients aged 18 years and older from 2011 to 2015. EHR and claims data were extracted from 3 health systems participating in PCORNet. Results: Without matching on claims-based health care utilization, the case management programs at 2 of 3 health systems were associated with fewer hospital admissions and emergency visits over the subsequent 12 months. With matching on claims-based health care utilization, case management was no longer associated with admissions and emergency visits at those 2 programs. Discussion: The results of a PCORNet-facilitated evaluation of 3 programs for high-need high-cost patients differed substantially depending on whether claims data were available for matching cases to comparison patients. Conclusions: Partnering with learning health systems to rapidly evaluate programs for high-need high-cost patients will require that PCORNet facilitates comprehensive and timely access to both electronic health records and health insurance claims data.
Education & Educational Research	Synergistic learning combining computational thinking (CT) and STEM has proven to be an effective method for advancing learning and understanding in a number of STEM domains and simultaneously helping students develop important CT concepts and practices. We adopt a design-based approach to develop, evaluate, and refine our Collaborative, Computational STEM (C2STEM) learning environment. The system adopts a novel paradigm that combines visual model building with a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) to scaffold learning of high school physics using a computational modeling approach. In this paper, we discuss the design principles that guided the development of our open-ended learning environment (OELE) using a learning-by-modeling and evidence-centered approach for curriculum and assessment design. Students learn by building models that describe the motion of objects, and their learning is supported by scaffolded tasks and embedded formative assessments that introduce them to physics and CT concepts. We have also developed preparation for future learning (PFL) assessments to study students' abilities to generalize and apply CT and science concepts and practices across problem solving tasks and domains. We use mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to analyze student learning during a semester-long study run in a high school physics classroom. We document some of the lessons learned from this study and discuss directions for future work.
Linguistics	"This paper examines Greek invitations as first pair parts of an adjacency pair within the framework of Conversation Analysis. The focus of our research is on impromptu invitations issued via polar negative-interrogative constructions and the effects this type of construction has on the interactional organization of the whole invitation-response sequence. It is suggested that the issuing of the invitation by means of this particular syntactic choice has ramifications for the unfolding of the interaction with respect to sequencing and preference organization. Specifically, it is maintained that impromptu invitations issued by means of polar negative-interrogatives in Greek tend to trigger markedly delayed acceptances. It is suggested that the explanation for this phenomenon lies in the ""cross-cutting"" preferences built in the construction when used to make impromptu invitations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Communication	In Critical Discourse Studies (CDS) and in other linguistics oriented scholarly journals we now see more research which draws upon multimodality as part of carrying out analyses of how texts make meaning, in order to draw out the ideologies which they carry. However, much of multimodality is itself based closely on one theory of language called Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). And despite calls from some scholars there has been no real interrogation of the concepts and models drawn from this theory as regards how suitable they are both for analyzing different forms of communication and for answering concrete research questions of the nature asked in CDS. In this paper we assess the core principles, taken from SFL into multimodality. Using examples we consider which are more or less suitable for the kinds of work we do in CDS. We make a case that SFL has a narrow notion of 'texts' and a weak notion of context. We show how we can address such problems to deal with what we call the 'materiality' of multimodal communication.
Social Issues	Volunteer role identity has long been of interest to social scientists seeking to understand volunteer commitment and the psychological consequences of volunteering. The study reported here tests the theory that predicts that people identify more strongly with the volunteer role as compensation for the absence of other productive roles. Using a sample (n = 572) of Dutch volunteers over the age of 50, we find a strong association between age and volunteer role identity. For older volunteers, the volunteer role is a more important part of who they are. We find that retirement plays an important role in this. The retirement effect, in turn, is accounted for by the extra time retirees invest in the role, signaling a compensation strategy. We find a similar substitution effect for the unemployed/disabled, but not for widowhood. The study makes a contribution by situating the explanation of volunteer role identity within a life-course framework.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose: Serious head injuries, also known as traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), are associated with an increase in aggression and violent tendencies. The current study extends the literature on head injuries by examining whether gang membership is associated with an elevated risk of head injury in prison, and the extent to which this relationship is mediated by different forms of prison violence. Methods: We use data from the LoneStar Project, a representative sample of 802 men imprisoned in Texas. We assess the gang membership-head injury link using logistic regression and Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) mediation. Results: Prison gang members were >2.5 times as likely to report a head injury in prison compared to non-gang members (OR = 2.593; 95% CI = 1.220-5.509), net of controls. KHB mediation analyses reveal that violent misconduct and violent victimization collectively reduced the magnitude of the relationship between gang membership and in-prison head injury by 34.84%. Conclusions: Prison gang members have a higher risk of head injury in prison, which we demonstrate is largely a function of their increased involvement in prison violence. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions should be used to lessen the negative repercussions from head injury and would be beneficial for reentry preparation.
Nursing	Despite the release of guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on safe infant sleep and public service campaigns aimed at reducing risk factors over the past 25 years, deaths due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID) are still the 4th leading causes of infant death in the United States. Findings from several studies demonstrate that nurses do not consistently model safe sleep practices with infants due to a lack of education on evidence-based practice and misconceptions regarding safe infant sleep. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the need for expanded education to both nurses and parents on the principles of safe infant sleep and the impact it can have on decreasing risk factors for SIDS and SUID. Strategies are outlined for additional education for nurses and parents to enhance adherence to safe sleep guidelines and quality improvement projects aimed at the implementation of culture change are discussed. Going forward it is critical that nurses take an active role in seeking additional education on modifiable risk factors linked to SIDS and SUID and use that education to model and teach safe infant sleep practices with every infant at every encounter.

Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The purpose of this study was to evaluate how the impacts from the 2022 World Cup preparations in Qatar influenced local residents' attitudes, personal and community quality of life perceptions, excitement about hosting the event, and support toward the event. The examination of the way mega sport event impacts influence residents' perceptions of personal and community quality of life is lacking in the literature. Data were collected using systematic sampling in October 2014 from Qatari nationals and white-collar expatriates. Overall, 2,163 interviews with Qatari nationals (1,058) and white-collar expatriates (1,105) were completed. The results revealed that eight years before the event, sociocultural impacts were the most influential type of impact for residents' attitudes toward the event, community and personal quality of life, excitement about the event, and support of the FIFA decision to host the event in Qatar.
Social Work	A response to the critique of where social work research currently stands, as put forth by Garrow and Hasenfeld, and their position that social work research should be undertaken from a feminist perspective. It is important to remember the origins and foundation of feminist thought and to approach research and practice with a full understanding of what both empiricist epistemology and feminist standpoint epistemology actually means. Maintaining a balanced perspective and recognizing the value in varied approaches to scientific inquiry will keep the field of social work moving toward its ultimate goal of reducing the plight of marginalized and oppressed peoples. Social work research and practice has always claimed itself to be committed to furthering social justice and equality and to building a society with a minimum of human suffering. In order to remain focused on these goals, perhaps a shift in perspective is necessary.
Area Studies	This article explores the poetry of Shah Isml Safav (d. 1524), the founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran. Established as an important historical source by Vladimir Minorsky during World War II, the issues surrounding the poetic corpus of Shah Isml have continued to attract the attention of historians of the Safavids. With examples from the earliest and most authentic manuscript, the idea of viewing this body of works as literary sources versus political propaganda is discussed in this article.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Many studies have documented how welfare service and professional practices increasingly depend upon the willingness of the citizen to engage actively in dialogues with professionals. This, however, produces the problem of how to deal with citizens who are silent. The framework of Motivational Interviewing presents itself as one solution to this problem. This article explores how Motivational Interviewing operates with a set of strategies to avoid the silence of citizens. We draw on theoretical concepts developed by Niklas Luhmann to analyse a particular instantiation of Motivational Interviewing produced by the Danish National Board of Health, namely a conversation concept entitled, the Marijuana Conversation. We ask thus: what is put at stake when health communication is designed to anticipate and make itself immune to the citizens' refusal to have a dialogue. Our analysis identifies the different strategies of the conversation concept to make it difficult for the citizen to refuse continued communication. We conclude that by trying to make itself immune to the citizen's 'no', the conversation undermines the possibilities of reaching its objective of empowering the citizen.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Available data show that online gamblers spend more money and dedicate more time to playing compared to gamblers who do not play online, and are more likely to experience gambling problems. Among online players, young people and poker players show higher rates of gambling problems. These observations can be explained in part by such dangerous aspects of online gambling (and also electronic gaming machines) as : immediate and convenient accessibility; ability to pay electronically and to play on credit; anonymity; and the possibility for players to consume alcohol or other drugs while playing. These are elements that could facilitate the development or the intensification of problem gambling. This being said, the public discourse about the inevitability of legalized online gambling is quite unanimous and built upon such arguments as: the imperative duty of the state to protect the population against the dangers of the online gambling black market; and the fact that the medium in itself provides excellent consumer safeguards. A growing number of legislators are following the trend and choosing to establish state control over online gambling. We present some epidemiological and analytical data that challenge some of these assertions and decisions. We recommend a better integration of public health arguments into the commercialization and marketing of online gambling.
Political Science	Voting technologies received considerable scrutiny after the 2000 election. However, the voter-poll worker interaction is also of critical importance. Poll workers exercise discretion and implement policies in ways that directly affect the voting experience. The authors examine the relationship between voters' perceptions of the poll worker job performance and measures of voter confidence. In an ordered logit model, the perception of poll workers is a significant predictor of voter confidence even in the presence of numerous controls. The results suggest that overlooking the recruitment and training of competent poll workers can have a detrimental effect on voter confidence.
Communication	This article examines black churches located in economically challenged neighborhoods in a northeastern US city. Employing the concepts of the organizational divide and Heek's design-actuality model, we conducted interviews with clergy at seven black churches to understand their level of information and communication technology (ICT) use and capacity to secure funding from the White House Office of Community and Faith-Based Initiatives (FBCI). Through the use of e-government services, the FBCI is expanding public-private partnerships with faith-based organizations to implement social programs that address community challenges. Our findings suggest that black churches are rich storehouses of local information and have a long history of providing social support and spiritual strength. This may make them logical beneficiaries of the FBCI. Paradoxically, the black churches that provide social programs to economically challenged citizens are often underresourced and lack the organizational capacity to secure FBCI resources.
Information Science & Library Science	"Mobile technology is increasingly an element to be considered a paradigm that is changing in education in general, and in higher education in particular. In addition, computers and information technology have increased educational opportunities and have opened the way to new teaching/learning approaches. Due to this, several concepts from the e-learning, m-learning and u-learning appeared. Therefore, it is critical to understand whether users (students and professors) are receptive and aware to adapt to this new paradigm before deciding to implement teaching learning methods based on mobile technology. Thus, it is necessary to make a fundamental question ""How do professors percept m-leaning?"" In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the perception of higher education professors in Portugal and Spain (Iberian Peninsula) regarding the m-learning, and to identify the needs of professors as they relate to mobile technologies and how they can be used to promote student's engagement inside and outside of the classroom. The main results obtained allow us to conclude that the majority of Iberian Peninsula professors have knowledge on how to perform the most trivial task with mobile devices and a high results about the utilization of both augmented reality and gamification applications."
Development Studies	Understanding the efficacy of development projects requires not only a plausible counterfactual but also an appropriate match between the shape of impact trajectory over time and the deployment of a corresponding array of research tools capable of empirically discerning such a trajectory. At present, however, the development community knows very little, other than by implicit assumption, about the expected shape of the impact trajectory from any given sector or project type, and as such is prone to routinely making attribution errors. Randomisation per se does not solve this problem. The sources and manifestations of these problems are considered, along with some constructive suggestions for responding to them.
Ethics	The issue of benefits in international clinical research is highly controversial. Against the background of wide recognition of the need to share benefits of research, the nature of benefits remains strongly contested. Little is known about the perspectives of research populations on this issue and the extent to which research ethics discourses and guidelines are salient to the expectations and aspirations existing on the ground. This exploratory study contributes to filling this void by examining perspectives of people in low-income South African communities on benefits in international clinical research. Twenty-four individuals with and without experience of being involved in clinical research participated in in-depth interviews. Respondents felt that ancillary care should be provided to clinical research participants, while a clinical study conducted in particular community should bring better health to its members through post-trial benefits. Respondents' perspectives were grounded in the perception that the ultimate goal of international clinical research is to improve local health. We argue that perspectives and understandings of the respondents are shaped by local moral traditions rather than clinical research specificities and require attention as valid moral claims. It is necessary to acknowledge such claims and cultural worlds from which they emerge, thus building the foundation for equal and embracing dialogue to bridge different perspectives and handle contradicting expectations.
Demography	This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism.
Social Work	Interviews with 44 families in New Zealand who had adopted children from Russia or Romania found that parents' interest in and children's exposure to the birth culture were related to the children's birth culture interest, but less related to their ethnic identification with the birth culture.
Political Science	That governments may not always keep their election promises or that they change policy positions may be unsurprising. However, failed promises, backing down on threats or flip-flopping on policy positions may be associated with a loss in support. Bringing together literature on the politics of electoral promises, policy shifts and audience costs, we examine the conditions under which a political leader can back down on a promise, using the EU referendum in the UK as a case study. Based on a survey experiment conducted in the aftermath of the 2015 general election, we examine whether justifications grounded on electoral motives, internal and external opposition would have allowed then Prime Minister David Cameron to avoid paying audience costs for going back on his campaign promise. Our results indicate that domestic audience costs might have been manageable, with only slightly more than a quarter of the participants in our study punishing executive inconsistency regardless of the justification employed. Of particular interest for European Union scholars, justifying backing down due to opposition from other EU member states is particularly effective in mitigating domestic audience costs.
Social Work	Runaway and homeless youth (RHY) are dependent on the specialized settings that locate, engage, and serve them. Yet, little research has focused on the features of effective settings for RHY. The present qualitative study, grounded in the Youth Program Quality Assessment model, explored characteristics of higher quality organizations for RHY and gaps that remain from staff and RHY perspectives. A total of 29 diverse settings serving RHY in New York State were randomly selected for participation, and ranked on a quantitative program quality index. Within settings, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with program administrators (N = 30) and other staff (N = 24). Focus group interviews were conducted with RHY (N = 13 focus groups; N = 84 RHY). Data were analyzed using a systematic content analysis approach that was both theory-driven and inductive, comparing higher to lower quality settings. We found all settings provided vital services and experienced challenges, but higher quality settings ameliorated challenges through (1) a youth-centered program philosophy equally understood by staff and RHY; (2) developmentally appropriate relationships between staff and RHY that promoted autonomy; (3) a focus on short- and long-term goals within anticipated crises; and (4) ongoing internal quality assessment procedures. Within lowerquality settings we found (1) difficulties retaining effective staff and (2) a primary focus on basic services and managing crises, but less attention to emotional support, exacerbated by (3) funding and other challenges emerging from the larger environment. The present study extends the literature on organizations for RHY by identifying characteristics of higher quality settings, and challenges that remain.
Environmental Studies	Land-use and land-cover change profoundly affect human well-being and, therefore, have become a major topic for society. A thorough understanding of past and present processes transforming landscapes is essential for guiding future developments toward the sustained provision of the ecosystem services humans critically depend upon. Drawing on the driving forces and resilience frameworks, we identify possible variables and patterns of land change, connecting them to empirical findings in three case study areas in the Swabian Alb region, southwestern Germany. GIS-based analysis of historical and contemporary maps from four time layers between the 1820s and 2009 reveals complex and spatially differentiated trajectories. Woodland expansion, marginal grass- and heathland conversion and expansion of urban areas were the main change processes affecting all case study areas. A literature review regarding causes of these changes points to socioeconomic drivers at the supraregional scale, playing themselves out in diverse ways on areas with contrasting natural site characteristics. Human agency also fosters the alteration of large-scale drivers of change at the local level. We conclude that policy and management strategies need to be particularly sensitive to natural site characteristics and take both driving forces and human agency into account. Landscape-scale studies of patterns and causes of land change, making cross-site and cross-issue comparisons, are necessary to test how far our insights may apply to other geographical contexts and land change processes.

Information Science & Library Science	How a scientific literature is shaped both at the local and general level is an important question to answer. One practical way of achieving this task is to identify the roles played by authors (academicians) as actors creating and disseminating knowledge in the relevant literature. To this end, this study examines roles undertaken by authors in the field of learning organizations. Identifying role typologies first requires revealing the author citation network in the field. Citation network is a matrix that summarizes citations and citation numbers between authors. To construct this matrix, articles in the local and general literature in the field of learning organizations, published and indexed between January 01, 2015 and February 20, 2017, were collected from Google Scholar by using the Java-based Selenium Library. An author citation network with 19,525 actors was created from this list. A social network analysis was conducted to identify author roles, followed by a discussion of what these roles mean for the local literature. Despite defining four typologies, observing only one type of role typology indicates that the local literature is not well integrated with the general literature. This study recommends strategic assessments for increasing the contribution ability of local literature to general one. Using this approach, it would be possible to find answers to the questions of which roles to develop via which authors and relationships, and how to remove the obstacles to development of local literature.
International Relations	The UN's commitment to zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse, which has been strengthened ever since the Secretary-General's 2003 'Bulletin', must be understood against the general public's non-tolerance of sexual misconduct by peacekeepers. While the UN has devoted its energy to restoring the public's confidence, the implementation of the policy cannot be effective, due to the limits of the UN's command authority, without the adoption of the same policy in contingent-contributing countries, who assume even greater roles under the revised model memorandum of understanding in 2007. Furthermore, not all victims approve the UN's zero tolerance pledge, out of fear that they may lose their only recourse to making a living. While it will likely take time to alleviate existing obstacles to align all the actors involved, the general public may not be tolerant enough to allow a further moratorium.
Ethics	This article considers attempts to include the issues of ageing and ill health in a Rawlsian framework. It first considers Norman Daniels' Prudential Lifespan Account, which reduces intergenerational questions to issues of intrapersonal prudence from behind a Rawslian veil of ignorance. This approach faces several problems of idealisation, including those raised by Hugh Lazenby, because it must assume that everyone will live to the same age, undermining its status as a prudential calculation. I then assess Lazenby's account, which applies Rawls' general theory of justice more directly to healthcare. Lazenby suggests that we should apply Rawls' difference principle - which claims that any inequalities in social goods must benefit the worst off - to conclude that we should significantly prioritise treatment of young patients. I argue first that the existence of young terminally ill patients undermines a number of Rawlsian arguments for the difference principle. I then argue that the structure of ageing undermines the Rawlsian decision mechanism of the 'veil of ignorance' on which Lazenby relies. I conclude that age and terminal illness present significant problems for any comprehensive Rawlsian account of justice.
Environmental Studies	By some accounts, invasive species pose the second greatest threat to global biodiversity after habitat destruction. In addition to their ecological impacts, invasive species cause a wide range of economic and social damages. In recent years, scholars and policy officials have called for recalibration of U.S. invasive species policy, with some advocating a tightly integrated policy regime addressing a broad spectrum of activity, including predictive assessment of invasion pathways, prevention of introduction and spread, control of established populations, eradication of selected populations, and establishment of high-level coordination bodies. In this paper, I draw upon the policy integration literature and apply a regime construct to review the proposition that the existing mix of U.S. invasive species policies can and should be more tightly integrated. By way of conclusion, I suggest that the current policy mix is not exhausted and recommend a program evaluation process framed to characterize and assess factors and conditions that might influence the comparative effectiveness of strategic alternatives to integration, such as coping and taming.
Business	Purpose - This paper aims to address the issue of survey distortion caused by one of the most common and pervasive sources of bias, namely social desirability bias (SDB). Despite 50 years of research, there are still many unanswered questions about its conceptualisation and operationalisation. The authors argue that traditional measures of SDB are inadequate and that the context in which the research is being conducted should be reflected in the measures employed. Hence, the authors develop and validate a multi-dimensional scale that may be used to measure the degree of SDB present in responses to giving surveys. Design/methodology/approach - Following initial scale development procedures a convenience sample of 820 donors to a national charity was employed to refine the resultant scale items. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were conducted to establish the dimensionality of the new scale and its reliability. Using a separate sample of 1,500 active donors, the scale was then subject to confirmatory procedures to test its predictive validity. Findings - The findings support the assertion that SDB is a multi-dimensional construct consisting of six dimensions. However, in the context of postal surveys it is found that self-deception and the degree of intrinsic benefit accruing to a donor are the primary determinants of the level of SDB an individual will exhibit. The authors also highlight the significance of the SDB issue since in the survey reported here, 65 per cent of respondents were found to over-report their giving. Originality/value - This is one of the first published studies that has been able to explore the predictive validity of a SDB scale. The work has expanded our understanding of the determinants of SDB and provided an instrument that may now be employed to reduce a significant proportion of this error in giving surveys.
International Relations	In his important new book National responsibility and global justice, David Miller presents a systematic challenge to existing theories of global justice. In particular, he argues that cosmopolitan egalitarianism must be rejected. Such views, Miller maintains, would place unacceptable burdens on the most productive political communities, undermine national self-determination, and disincentivize political communities from taking responsibility for their fate. They are also impracticable and quite unrealistic, at least under present conditions. Miller offers an alternative account that conceives global justice in terms of a minimum set of basic rights that belong to human beings everywhere. Primary responsibility for securing such rights for an individual lies with his or her state, but in so far as these rights go unprotected, responsibilities for fulfilling them may fall on outsiders. While less ambitious that cosmopolitan egalitarian justice, Miller argues that his own view would nevertheless enable us to articulate what is most morally objectionable about our current world. in this article it is argued that none of Miller's critiques of cosmopolitan egalitarianism is effective, and that while certainly preferable to the status quo, a world governed by Miller's principles is not an attractive ideal.
Ethnic Studies	This article looks at black church through the framework of playful pietyits aesthetic forms and expressive culture. Specifically, I interrogate how Issa Rae's Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl web series, entertainer Rickey Smiley, and the Preachers of LA reality television series mix black religiosity and humor. These pop cultural forms and forums serve as a venue for Black folks to not only see themselves enacted religiously but also to enjoy the foibles, fallacies, contributions, and even grace of black religious ways of being.
Area Studies	"Japan has now been mired in economic stagnation, punctuated by recurrent recessions, for the past two decades. What are the causes of this longstanding malaise? Is it merely the natural consequence of financial retrenchment and the onset of a pervasive ""liquidity trap"" after the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy in the early 1990s, or does the present slump signify a more profound historical phase of structural decline? The aim of this study is to provide several tentative hypotheses. In the first section, some of the possible causes of this phase of prolonged stagnation will be examined. The next section provides a theoretical treatment of the dynamics of debt-deflation from a Minsky-Fisher perspective. The final section evaluates whether the historical evidence lends credence to the debt-deflation thesis."
Criminology & Penology	"This study describes the implementation and initial descriptive findings from the Fugitive Safe Surrender (FSS) program, conducted in 20 cities, where 35,103 individuals who believed they had a warrant for their arrest surrendered voluntarily at a local church. A total of 3,501 felony persons had 4,238 felony warrants, and 18,400 misdemeanants accounted for 44,971 misdemeanor warrants. Nearly 1 in 5 had no warrant located, and less than 2% were arrested. For those with a new court date, 94% appeared as scheduled. An anonymous self-report survey showed 73% of respondents indicated it was important or very important that the surrender location was a church. The most common reasons cited for surrendering were to obtain a driver's license (47%), wanting to start over (42%), and fear of arrest (40%); many participants did not surrender previously because they did not have money to pay bail or fines. Policy Implications The Fugitive Safe Surrender program illustrates that collaborations between law enforcement and faith-based organizations can result in a significant number of open warrants being cleared in a nonconflict setting. This can be done without appreciably increasing the local jail population. Although our data do not provide for detailed cost-benefit analysis, communities cleared a significant number of outstanding warrants at a reduced cost relative to the typical resources required to serve open warrants, track down felony offenders, process bench warrants for failure to appear, or incarcerate wanted fugitives picked up during routine policing activities. In addition, FSS provides a safe environment for surrender, which reduces potentially dangerous interactions between law enforcement and fugitives on the street. Implementing a program like Fugitive Safe Surrender is fraught with many significant challenges, not the least of which is that most jurisdictions cannot provide an accurate count of the number of open local or state warrants in their community. This challenge makes an assessment of how effective FSS is in reducing the volume of known fugitives or warrants difficult to calculate. Most fugitives with active warrants had more than one and sometimes multiple types of warrants across multiple jurisdictions. A related issue is the number of persons who appeared thinking they had an active warrant but none could be located. These issues illustrate the need for consistency in how law enforcement agencies gather information on warrant and charge information, and the need for making this information available to persons in an accessible, flexible format. Persons who suspect they have a warrant could check the system to confirm their status, which also might provide them the impetus to surrender to authorities before their cases are embedded in the legal system. Persons with open warrants reported a major reason they did not resolve their case was the cost of obtaining a hearing. If we make the ability to post bond or pay a fine a prerequisite to have one's open warrant status resolved, then many persons will remain fugitives simply because of the economic cost of surrendering. Persons with open warrants already report high rates of unemployment and low rates of legitimate employment. Many persons appeared in large urban cities in part because there was no requirement to pay to receive a hearing of one's case. If the purpose of programs like FSS is to reintegrate persons as productive members of their community and provide them opportunities for legitimate employment, education, and the chance to get their driver's license back, then we need to examine the role of fiscal burden in the way our criminal justice system processes persons with outstanding warrants; in particular, those with traffic warrants, bench warrants for failure to appear, and child support warrants. On average, persons had open warrants that were more than 2 years old. Therefore, persons with warrants are either very good at evading capture if they want to, or our law enforcement systems are overwhelmed with the number of outstanding warrants and cannot possibly find, process, prosecute, and incarcerate the number of persons with open warrants for their arrest. FSS showed that it is not necessary to arrest and incarcerate everybody with an open warrant to resolve their case and reengage them in the justice system. Only 2.2% of persons with warrants were arrested, and for all those who received a new court date, often months later, more than 9 of 10 seemed to continue with the resolution of their case. At the core of the FSS program was the role of faith-based organizations and the importance of the church as the place where persons could surrender. This approach is different than the typically adversarial role of law enforcement interactions with citizens as they search actively for persons with open warrants, particularly those with felony or violent offense histories. In addition, FSS is contrary to the strategy of using deception to lure felony offenders to events so that they can be taken into custody. The role of police legitimacy and community trust of law enforcement and the role of the church in providing a setting for safe surrender deserves further exploration. This descriptive study does not provide specific information about the motivation of persons who surrender at a church because they believe they have an outstanding warrant for their arrest, nor does it specifically assess particular questions about why a person would choose to surrender versus continue to evade capture. These theoretical questions require additional investigation, particularly if we will learn more about the process individuals go through in making the choice to turn themselves in voluntarily or the perceptions about the role of the church in their decision to surrender voluntarily. Last, a major policy question is whether a program like FSS should be offered on a regular basis. Aside from cost and safety benefits to the justice system, what would keep individuals with open warrants from waiting for the next FSS program to resolve their cases? Providing a program like FSS too frequently may be counterproductive by inadvertently encouraging persons to evade capture until the next program comes along offering them favorable consideration, the chance to resolve their case without paying a fine or bond, and the chance to start again with a clean slate. It remains an open question whether this strategy is truly a chance to start over and ""get their lives back together"" or a chance to take advantage of the system and reoffend."
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The video recording of lessons allows the analysis results to provide data about the teaching practice. Analyzing the pedagogical practice itself allows the teacher an exercise of self-reflection, as they become aware of their behavior in the classroom, leading to the revitalization of their teaching model. This study aims to present the use of autoscopy as a stimulus to reflection, to a new understanding of the pedagogical practice of teachers, in an action research. This is a case study, with a qualitative and descriptive approach, performed with a new nursing teacher. The data were initially collected through a semistructured biographical interview and subsequent video recording of the classes, characterizing nonparticipant observations. The application of autoscopy followed the proposal of action research, with its phases: exploratory phase, in-depth research, action phase, and evaluation phase. The autoscopy was a useful strategy to stimulate teacher reflection because during the projection of the sketches selected for the video of the autoscopy session, the teacher can see himself or herself in action and self-analyze and discuss the selected pedagogical moments, stimulating reflection and generating a new understanding about his or her teaching practice. In this way, the use of autoscopy under the epistemological perspective of action research stimulates the self-analysis and reflection of the teaching practice.
Anthropology	"Objectives Infant handling describes cases in which youngsters are temporarily removed from the care of their mothers and ""taken care of"" (held, carried, etc.) by other conspecifics. Handlers may gain indirect fitness benefits from these actions and can practice mothering skills, thereby improving the odds of survival of their own infants. Great apes are notable for displaying little infant handling. Apart from anecdotal observations, no published data exist on infant handling in wild mountain gorillas. We tested two of the most pertinent explanations (""kin selection"" and ""learning to mother"") in a wild population of mountain gorillas in Rwanda. We predicted that (a) nulliparous females would exhibit infant handling (i.e., carrying) more than parous females and (b) maternal kin would exhibit more infant handling than nonkin. Methods We collated 8 years of data on infant carrying behavior collected in 13 groups monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center. Results Infant handling is an infrequent behavior (1,783 instances over 25,600 observation hours). A strong positive effect of relatedness and handler parity on the frequency of infant handling emerged. Conclusions While the nature of handler-infant interactions (affiliative, abusive, etc.) remains unstudied, they could constitute alloparental care and could therefore attenuate maternal energetic burden and ultimately allow increased birth rates. However, the rarity of this behavior makes it an unlikely contributor to mountain gorillas' relatively short interbirth intervals."
History Of Social Sciences	This article examines the evolving connections between local conditions and knowledge processes in women's and gender studies, a research field in the social sciences and humanities. Data are historical records from five early-adopting women's and gender studies units in the United States and interviews with affiliated professors. In their formative years, these programs were consistent in their intellectual content. Scholars across sites defined the purpose of women's studies similarly: to address the lack of research on women and social problems of sex inequality. Gradually, scholars incorporated a range of analytic categories into women's studies' agenda, including gender identities and masculinities, leading to diverse understandings and redefinitions of the central objects of analysis. Analytic shifts are reflected in differences in the institutional and intellectual composition of programs and departments. To explain how local departmental conditions affect the conception of core objects of study in gender research, the author builds on the literature on knowledge ecologies and introduces the concept of the supple object.
Demography	BACKGROUND Depending on whether the global level of fertility is assumed to converge to the current European TFR (similar to 1.5) or that of Southeast Asia or Central America (similar to 2.5), global population will either decline to 2.3-2.9 billion by 2200 or increase to 33-37 billion, if mortality continues to decline. Furthermore, sizeable human populations exist where the voluntarily chosen ideal family size is heavily concentrated around one child per woman with TFRs as low as 0.6-0.8. However, the UN population projections to 2300 use a much narrower band of possible future TFRs. OBJECTIVE If the two-child norm is not necessarily the end-point of transition, what would be the consequences of the currently reported low fertility rates being sustained and becoming widespread? METHODS We present new projections for 13 IPCC world regions with scenarios calculated on the basis of regular cohort-component projections by age and sex in single-year time steps up to 2300, each based upon a much broader set of fertility assumptions than currently employed. We create three mortality scenarios based upon maximum life expectancies of 90, 100, and 110, as well as a series of 'special' scenarios. RESULTS Even under conditions of further substantial increases in life expectancy, world population size would decline significantly if the world in the longer run followed the current examples of Europe and East Asia. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to Malthusian disaster scenarios, our exercise illustrates the distinct possibility of significant population shrinking associated with increasing life expectancy and human well-being.
Substance Abuse	Background: Limited research examines depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and social support among HIV-infected people who inject drugs. Objectives: Using longitudinal data, we investigated whether perceived social support moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and alcohol use among HIV-infected men who inject drugs in Vietnam. Methods: Data were collected from participants (N = 455; mean age 35 years) in a four-arm randomized controlled trial in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with 94% retention excluding dead (N = 103) or incarcerated (N = 37) participants. Multilevel growth models were used to assess whether: (1) depressive symptoms predict when risk of alcohol use is elevated (within-person effects); (2) depressive symptoms predict who is at risk for alcohol use (between-person effects); and (3) within- and between-person perceived social support moderates the depressive symptoms-alcohol relationship. Results: Participants reported high but declining levels of depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants with higher depressive symptoms drank less on average (B = -0.0819, 95% CI -0.133, -0.0307), but within-person, a given individual was more likely to drink when they were feeling more depressed than usual (B = 0.136, 95% CI 0.0880, 0.185). The positive relationship between within-person depressive symptoms and alcohol use grew stronger at higher levels of within-person perceived social support. Conclusions: HIV-infected men who inject drugs have increased alcohol use when they are experiencing higher depressive symptoms than usual, while those with higher average depressive symptoms over time report less alcohol use. Social support strengthens the positive relationship between within-person depressive symptoms and alcohol use.
Demography	"The salutary effect of formal education on health-risk behaviors and mortality is extensively documented: ceteris paribus, greater educational attainment leads to healthier lives and longevity. Even though the epidemiological evidence has strongly indicated formal education as a leading ""social vaccine,"" there is intermittent reporting of counter-education gradients for health-risk behavior and associated outcomes for certain populations during specific periods. How can education have both beneficial and harmful effects on health, and under which contexts do particular effects emerge? It is useful to conceptualize the influence of education as a process sensitive to the nature, timing of entry, and uniqueness of a new pleasurable and desirable lifestyle and/or product (such as smoking) with initially unclear health risks for populations. Developed herein is a hypothesis that the education gradient comprises multiple potent pathways (material, psychological, cognitive) by which health-risk behaviors are influenced, and that there can be circumstances under which pathways act in opposite directions or are differentially suppressed and enhanced. We propose the population education transition (PET) curve as a unifying functional form to predict shifting education gradients across the onset and course of a population's exposure to new health risks and their associated consequences. Then, we estimate PET curves for cases with prior epidemiological evidence of heterogeneous education gradients with health-risk behaviors related to mass-produced cigarettes in China and the United States; saturated fats, sugar, and processed food diets in Latin America; and HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Each offers speculation on interactions between environmental factors during population exposure and education pathways to health-risk behaviors that could be responsible for the temporal dynamics of PET curves. Past epidemiological studies reporting either negative or positive education gradients may not represent contradictory findings as much as come from analyses unintentionally limited to just one part of the PET process. Last, the PET curve formulation offers richer nuances about educational pathways, macro-historical population dynamics, and the fundamental cause of disease paradigm."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The integration of mental health services into primary care is a globally acclaimed strategy to close the treatment gap for mental disorders, but it has also been criticised for encouraging the medicalisation of everyday life. In Chile, this strategy has gained support and spread quickly in the last decades, and today, all primary public care centres have incorporated a mental health service. However, although some reports highlight problems that have arisen with integrated primary care, the critical social analysis of its impact on services, teams and communities is scarce. This article aims to analyse how primary public mental healthcare services (PPMHSs) in Chile could be contributing to medicalise life. Health policies, reports, evidence from research on local public health issues and the author's experience are examined to develop the arguments. It is suggested that issues with the universal health access and integrated primary public care policies and the institutionalised use of standard classifications of mental disorders support the survival of a reductionist biomedical disease model and a trend to psychopathologise life. We conclude that these factors underpin the medicalisation of everyday life in primary public mental healthcare services in Chile. Critical engagement with daily practice is necessary to prevent PPMHSs from disempowering people and communities by providing them with medicalised solutions, instead of generating agency in their everyday problem-solving behaviours.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This essay reflects on the development of the field of deliberative democracy by discussing twelve key findings that capture a number of resolved issues in normative theory, conceptual clarification, and associated empirical results. We argue that these findings deserve to be more widely recognized and viewed as a foundation for future practice and research. We draw on our own research and that of others in the field.
Anthropology	A reduction in enamel thickness due to disrupted amelogenesis is referred to as enamel hypoplasia (EH). Linear EH in permanent teeth is a widely accepted marker of systemic physiological stress. An enigmatic, nonlinear form of EH commonly manifest in great ape and human deciduous canines (dc) is known as localized hypoplasia of primary canines (LHPC). The etiology of LHPC and what it signifies-localized traumatic or systemic physiological stress-remains unclear. This report presents frequency data on LHPC hypostotic cranial traits, and tooth size in a sample of juvenile bonobos, then tests hypotheses of intertrait association that improve knowledge of the etiology and meaning of LHPC. The fenestration hypothesis is tested using hypostotic cranial traits as a proxy for membrane bone ossification, and the relationship between tooth size, LHPC, and hypostosis is investigated. Macroscopic observations of EH, hypostotic traits, and measurements of buccolingual tooth size were conducted according to established standards. LHPC was found in 51.2% of bonobos (n = 86) and in 26% of dc teeth (n = 269). Hypostotic traits were observed in 55.2% of bonobos (n = 96). A test of the association between LHPC and hypostosis yielded nonsignificant results (chi(2) = 2.935; P = 0.0867). Primary canines were larger in specimens with LHPC than in unaffected specimens (paired samples t test; udc, P = 0.011; ldc, P = 0.018), a result consistent with the fenestration hypothesis of LHPC pathogenesis. Hypostosis was not associated with differences in tooth size (P > 0.05). LHPC may be an indirect indicator of physiological stress, resulting from large, buccally displaced primary canines.

Women'S Studies	The pervasive and popularised concept of a freshly modernised and progressive world for girls and young women has been ushered in by theories of post-industrial individualisation, neo-liberalism and its dovetailing with liberal variants of feminism. Such optimistic notions of new-found freedom for women in Western democracies celebrate the shrinking of imposed constraints and exclusions and the enthusiastic endorsement of individual choice. This article reports on recently completed empirical research in an Australian context which questions just how dramatically the lives of young women have changed. It identifies the role that the lauded concept of choice plays in overstating women's advancement and disguising socially generated inequality. In particular, young women in this study comprehend domestic violence, unequal parenting and housework as matters of choice, while also implicitly understanding that they do not live up to the imagined unencumbered rational choice individuals of liberalism. The implications of an invigorated conservative, masculinist agenda disguised in a women's rights discourse are discussed. Feminists are confronted with a changed socio-political climate where the subordination of girls and women is allowed to occur more covertly within a framework of ostensible commitment to equality, the valorisation of choice and through seductive incitements to individual responsibility.

Management	This article introduces a new construct to the field of management called Psychological Sense of Community (PSOC). This is important because management scholars are calling for the creation of communities in organizations in an environment that lacks appropriate construct development. The aims of this article are threefold: (a) develop a working definition of PSOC via a review of the extant literature on PSOC from other disciplines with the goal of translating it into the domain of management, (b) synthesize findings from parallel literatures on the outcomes of PSOC with an eye toward exploring the relevance of such outcomes in management contexts, and (c) assess the value of PSOC as it relates to its uniqueness in relation to other prominent management constructs and its scope of applicability in a variety of management inquiry areas.
Health Policy & Services	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The transition from volume- to value-based care calls for closer working relationships between physician groups and health systems. Healthcare executives are in the position of determining when and how physician groups are integrated into healthcare systems. Leveraging the theory of migration, we aim to describe where physician-system integration is headed and offer recommendations on how executives can respond to physician migration to and from integration. We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with CEOs, chief medical officers, chief financial officers, and physician group chief executives from eight of Washington State's largest integrated delivery systems. These executives predicted tighter integration and more forced alignment; however, some clinician executives were skeptical about whether the physician employment model will be the right course despite the growing demand from younger physicians. The results of these interviews suggest that integration will be driven by push and pull factors stemming from five prevailing forces: social (community), social (physicians), economic, political, and technological. Understanding the factors that influence physicians' decisions to migrate can provide insight for and guidance to executives contemplating integration in the current climate.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	This study aimed to examine insurance coverage, use of the healthcare system, satisfaction with care, transition from pediatric to adult healthcare services, and social and emotional support for individuals with genetic conditions. In June 2013, the National Genetics Education and Consumer Network surveyed US individuals with genetic conditions about their healthcare experiences. Chi square statistics were used to compare use of the healthcare system, satisfaction, social and emotional support of children (0-17 years) and adults (18 + years) with genetic conditions. There were 1895 valid responses (53.0 % individuals with genetic conditions, 47.0 % parents of these individuals). The findings suggest several potential areas to impact the quality of care received by this population. The majority of respondents reported that they had: (1) more than one health professional they considered to be their personal doctor or nurse (70.5 % children; 57.8 % adults); (2) providers that listened carefully to their needs always or most of the time (82.2 % children; 83.5 % adults); and (3) providers that usually or always involved them as partners in their care (78.4 % children; 66.6 % adults). However, several significant differences around care and support received between children versus adults and areas of need were reported. Most persons surveyed received care from a system of providers that was self- or parent- coordinated and lacked sufficient social and emotional support. Data from this study will inform practice and identifies further research needed to improve care provided to individuals with genetic conditions who require a combination of specialty and primary care.
Business	This paper examines four methodological approaches that International Business research can apply in culturally diverse empirical settings. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of inductive/deductive, emic/etic, abductive, combined emic/etic designs, and crystallization, the paper presents an alternative crossover-dialog approach. The crossover-dialog approach draws from existing approaches but further develops them so they will be applicable in culturally diverse environments. An empirical study from China illustrates this new approach. The advantage of the crossover-dialog design is an ability to be grounded in international empirical settings while simultaneously benefiting from existing theories. The crossover-dialog's context-sensitivity and multi-disciplinary approach ensure a respectful understanding of the other party while not neglecting etic theories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Business	If stakeholder theory is to become a full theory of business-society relationships, it will have to develop a better understanding of processes by which stakeholders may gain and hold influence over firms. A better understanding of the political processes involved is required. This paper-as well as the papers in this special issue-takes a political 'view' to addressing the issue, and thereby extends the currently dominant demographic and structural approaches. It suggests that the influence of stakeholders over firms is the temporary outcome of processes of action, reaction, and interaction among various parties. Consequently, the further advancement of stakeholder theory would benefit from the adoption of process-research methods and thinking.
Urban Studies	"A number of cities globally have developed ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and New York City has publicly committed to reducing emissions 80% by 2050 (80 x 50). While physical infrastructure is important, cities can gain important insights through information about human behavior, as people are the end users of buildings, transportation, and other physical assets. In this paper, we present a simplistic, pilot agent-based model (ABM) for New York City with projections about the city""s potential for reaching the 80 x 50 goal in the building sector. Importantly, the ABM models occupant choices about technology adoption to predict the prevalence of green buildings in coming years. We find that even though traditional building types are slow to transition, CO2 production still decreases substantially over the forecast interval. Traditional buildings begin to slow their dominance in the model pathways by approximately 10 years into the forecast. Although the ABM presented here relies on simplistic assumptions about human agents and brings a high level of uncertainty, it presents a useful pilot tool to begin to understand system-level impacts from micro-level actions of households and individuals, and provides vast potential for future use of ABMs for this task."
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	The objective was to estimate the burden of disease from lower limb amputations attributable to diabetes mellitus in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from 2008 to 2013. A descriptive epidemiological study was performed by calculating disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Burden of disease was high, more than 8,000 DALY in men and women. Disability accounted for 93% of DALY and mortality for 7.5%. The burden in men was 5,580.6 DALY, almost double that in women (2,894.8), and the share of the years lost due to disability (YLD) component in men pushed this rate to 67.6% of total DALY. Men live longer following amputation, so they lose more years of healthy life (65.8%), while mortality is higher in women (61%). DALY rates were not distributed homogeneously across the state. The intensification of evaluation, planning, and development of cost-effective strategies for prevention and health education for diabetic foot should be oriented according to higher male vulnerability.
Cultural Studies	Jack Goody's work on the origins, spatial extent and defining characteristics of modernity has vigorously questioned claims that only European history led to assorted modern characteristics: capitalism, science, democracy, romantic love, and inwardly-motivated personal restraint. He argues that many societies which experienced the Bronze Age urban revolution share certain important material similarities (and some differences) which set them apart from others, and are best understood by constructing an analytical grid rather than categorical stages. With respect to alleged affective differences, Goody takes a more strongly relativist stance, rejecting any developmental divide in the prevalence of romantic love, internalized self-discipline, etc. These useful steps nonetheless generate new problems. One concerns the relationship between material/technical changes, which seem to suggest a few very general historical periods (one marked by early metallurgy, writing, etc., and another by the modern energy revolution), and affective traits, which have no history in this schema. A second concerns periodization itself; while agreeing that periods defined by the experience of one region (e. g. a feudal era) are usually unhelpful, some general terms (such as early modern) do seem essential for conceptualizing developments that, though less epochal than writing or fossil fuels, are nonetheless important.
Sociology	P>Given increasing political and financial commitments to wildfire preparedness, risk policy demands that risk identification, assessment, and mitigation activities are balanced among diverse resident groups. Essential for this is the understanding of residents' perceptions of wildfire risks. This study compares wildfire-risk perceptions of Pennsylvania residents with those of Minnesotans living in natural-amenity-rich communities. Natural-amenity-driven migration shifts land-use patterns and social conditions, making it important to understand if and how such changes affect residents' perceptions of wildfire. Key informant interviews suggest land use and contrasting values associated with sociodemographic shifts were intertwined with wildfire-risk awareness, concern, and mitigation. In both study areas, local social interactions were impaired by geospatial and sociocultural barriers related to land use and population change. Barriers included perceived threats to quality of life, conflicting needs for economic development, and homes built in isolated locations. As a result, residents did not agree on community-wide notions of wildfire risk and response. Further, residents' ideas about the potential for a wildfire disaster did not correspond to those of risk managers. Although some places were attempting to overcome these challenges, many informants said their communities were overwhelmed with the effects of change. Finding common notions of wildfire risk is critical precisely because resident participation is crucial to hazard management. In these localities, rural community development can facilitate capacities to address wildfire risk in the context of landscape and social change.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	This paper compares a firm's innovation and performance with its online Web presence measured through the Web network structure. 489 firms in five different industries listed on the United States and Chinese stock markets are investigated. Using Web link data collected from Bing, blogs, Twitter and Wikipedia, we find positive correlation between betweenness centrality of a firm in the Web network and its innovation capability; and between betweenness centrality and financial performance. In order to get more accurate forecasting results, regression analysis is done for each industry and the combined industries in the United States and China. We also find that Twitter and Wikipedia only predict a firm's performance in the United States, which is not surprising as they are officially blocked in China. Blogs predict better in China than they do in the United States, as it might still be a major social media tool for Chinese firms; while for the US firms, blogs have been supplemented by Twitter and Wikipedia.
Area Studies	The Camara dos Deputados, the lower house of Brazil's National Congress, is a leader in the digitization and online dissemination of audiovisual recordings of legislative sessions. Its website hosts the Arquivo Sonoro, an initiative of the Camara's audiovisual department, which contains over 120,000 hours of recordings of speeches, votes, and committee meetings spanning over half a century. The Camara also makes available online complete video of sessions dating back three years. This research note explores the methodological, historical, and pedagogical opportunities that these audiovisual sources offer scholars and educators. It employs as examples the research of a faculty member, a doctoral candidate, and three undergraduate students, all of whom are among the contributors to a digital humanities project that showcases this remarkable resource. By highlighting ambient noise, volume, emotion, body language, grammatical errors, regional or ethnic accents, and discrepancies with the written record, the authors demonstrate some of the ways that aurality and visuality can enrich and complicate humanities and social science research. They also reveal the multifaceted benefits of institutional support for the digitization of archival material and its free dissemination online to scholars and the public.
Ethics	"Environmental changes can bear upon the environmental virtues, having effects not only on the conditions of their application but also altering the concepts themselves. I argue that impending radical changes in global climate will likely precipitate significant changes in the dominate world culture of consumerism and then consider how these changes could alter the moral landscape, particularly culturally thick conceptions of the environmental virtues. According to Jonathan Lear, as the last principal chief of the Crow Nation, Plenty Coups exhibited the virtue of ""radical hope,"" a novel form of courage appropriate to a culture in crisis. I explore what radical hope may look like today, arguing how it should broadly affect our environmental character and that a framework for future environmental virtues will involve a diminished place for valuing naturalness as autonomy from human interference."
Education, Special	This article reports two related studies. In the first study, concern and rejection ratings of 14 inclusive teachers toward 26 students with disabilities were correlated with teacher-student interactions. Partial correlations, controlling for severity of disability, indicated that instructional-academic interactions corresponded significantly with teachers' concern ratings and noninstructional-behavioral interactions corresponded significantly with teachers' rejection ratings. In the second study, the authors compared teachers' concern and rejection ratings of students with learning disabilities (n = 77), cognitive disabilities (n = 44), attention-deficit disorder (n = 20), behavioral disorders (n = 19), and no disabilities (n = 1,153) in 65 inclusive classes using ANOVAs and Scheffe post hoc tests. Students in all disability categories received significantly higher concern ratings than nondisabled students, students with learning disabilities and behavioral disorders received significantly higher rejection ratings than nondisabled students, and students with behavioral disorders received significantly higher rejection ratings than students with cognitive disabilities.
Ethics	Understanding how institutional review boards/research ethics committees (IRBs/RECs) perform risk/benefit assessment is important to help improve their function. In environmental ethics, uncertainty about potential outcomes and the precautionary principle play important roles in regulatory oversight but have received little attention in the context of human research ethics. We carried out an empirical study to gain insight into uncertainty by asking IRB/REC members about confidence in their risk assessments immediately after discussion of new protocols under review. Based on 12 meetings carried out by four IRBs/RECs over a 6-month period, we found a robust, inverse relationship between risk and confidence. As risk increased, confidence decreased. We detected different patterns of consensus between different IRBs/RECs and their members. Our study introduces a novel and relatively easy to implement approach to begin to understand IRB/REC decision making in real time that can be used within or across institutions.
Environmental Studies	China's economy has grown to become the third largest-and counting-in the world. However, rapid development has exacted a toll: China's cities and rivers are among the dirtiest on Earth, and the nation now emits more carbon dioxide per year than any other. From an objective standpoint, a sustainable future appears in doubt, but what do the inhabitants of China's cities believe?
Health Policy & Services	Background: E-health initiatives on the Internet can be used to provide support to people with chronic diseases and to their caregivers. In 2014/2015, we created a free website called jesuisautonome.fr where older people, or their carers on their behalf, can assess their independence in daily living by filling out a simple questionnaire. Objectives: To evaluate the interest of the public in websites of this kind, by analysing home care plans obtained via the self-assessment questionnaire. We also describe patterns of use and visitor behaviour. Method: Over a period of 6 months, we analysed data from the website in terms of the basic characteristics of the user; the number of questionnaires completed; the main types of needs in terms of home support; and data from Google Analytics about the number of visitors, user behaviour and behaviour flow. Results: During the 6-month study period, 439 visitors to the site either viewed, part-completed or fully completed the questionnaire. A total of 190 users completed the questionnaire. Seventy-one per cent of the completed questionnaires were from family caregivers, and 29% were from senior citizens. The mean age of those receiving care was 78 +/- 10.46 years. Their main needs were for domiciliary care (29.3%). Data from Google Analytics showed about 420 visits per month. Approximately 7.5% completed a questionnaire, approximately 5.3% downloaded a home care plan and there was a bounce rate of about 62%. Conclusion: First results from this website tend to endorse its use as a means of making practical solutions available to caregivers and older people.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	'Cultural neuroscience' presents itself as a new research paradigm within the neurosciences that takes the mutual constitution of culture, mind and brain seriously. As such, it has already gained considerable attention both among neuroscientists and traditional cultural psychologists. A superficial look at some of the studies published by practitioners in the field, however, might leave one with the impression that cultural neuroscience has more to do with the corroboration of well-established cultural cliches than with the broadening of mind it promises to bring about. In this article, we take a closer look at the emerging field of cultural neuroscience. The first section provides an overview of cultural neuroscience both with respect to the vision put forward by its proponents and to the actual state of research. In the second section, we engage with cultural neuroscience's parent discipline, cultural psychology, to gain a better understanding of the constructs and paradigms used by cultural neuroscientists. We conclude with three constructive proposals for a 'truly cultural cultural neuroscience' that avoids the popular pitfalls of essentialism and reductionism.

Substance Abuse	Research has yet to examine stability in employment as a function of cannabis use once an individual transitions into full-time work. Using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, trajectories of cannabis use spanning ages 14 to 30 were identified among a sample of predominantly minorities (>80%; 68% African American). After hard-classifying individuals by patterns of cannabis use, probabilities of full-time employment and conditional probabilities of full-time employment were calculated and compared across patterns of use. Abstention or rare cannabis use was associated with a higher likelihood of full-time employment compared with other cannabis use patterns. Full-time employment stability was high for each pattern of cannabis use (>89%) and differences decreased with age and prior periods of employment. The results indicate that patterns of cannabis use spanning adolescence to adulthood have limited impact on the ability to retain full-time employment once employed and are interpreted in light of growing legalization of cannabis use.
Development Studies	Like most other concepts in the social sciences, 'development' does not entail a commonly agreed upon meaning, context or programme of action. It is defined in different ways depending on the time, space, context, professional and organisational interests of the one who does the business of defining. The meaning of development has also undergone a remarkable transformation over the course of history from the Enlightenment concept of 'Progress' to encompass a great variety of human needs. This paper analyses how the contemporary discourse of development has reached a mature state and how it enables us to understand development in context- and culture-sensitive ways. It is now possible to determine what development means in different settings, and how to bring in material and non-material prosperity to people living in different contexts and cultures. After a theoretical discussion an empirical study in Sri Lanka is presented which attempts to arrive at a more refined context- and culture-sensitive definition of development. The paper argues that, in order to understand development at micro-settings, it is better to construct our own indexes of development rather than using global measures. It shows how the current state of the discourse of development can lend insights into construction of a development index.
Business, Finance	The never-told story of how an unlikely group of billionaires and politicians quietly passed a law that revolutionizes investment in struggling regions-and offers one of the greatest tax-avoidance opportunities in American history.
History Of Social Sciences	"There has been a long discussion among historians about the impact that foundation policies had on the development of the social sciences during the interwar era. This discussion has centered on the degree to which foundation officers, particularly from the Rockefeller boards, exercised a hegemonic influence on research. In this essay, I argue that the field of American cultural anthropology has been neglected and must be reconsidered as a window into foundation intervention in nature-nurture debates. Despite foundation efforts to craft an anthropology policy that privileged hereditarian explanations, I contend that cultural anthropologists were committed to proving the primacy of ""nurture,"" even when that commitment cost them valuable research dollars. It was this commitment that provided an essential bulwark for the discipline. Ironically, it was the need to negotiate with foundations about the purpose of their research that helped cultural anthropologists to articulate their unique, and thus intrinsically valuable, approach to nature-nurture debates.

Economics	We use two general equilibrium models to explain why changes in the external economic environment result in pro-cyclical aggregate dividend payout behavior. Both models that we consider endogenize low elasticity of investment. The first model incorporates capital adjustment costs, while the second one assumes that risk-averse managers maximize their own objective function rather than shareholder wealth. We show that, while both models generate pro-cyclical aggregate dividends, a feature consistent with the observed business-cycle pattern of payouts from well-diversified portfolios, the second model provides a more likely explanation for this effect. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating agency conflicts when considering the relationship between the external economic environment and the financial behavior of businesses.

Ethics	Building on research in anthropology and philosophy, one can make a distinction between type I and type II energy ethics as a framework for advancing public debate about energy. Type I holds energy production and use as a fundamental good and is grounded in the assumption that increases in energy production and consumption result in increases in human wellbeing. Conversely, type II questions the linear relationship between energy production and progress by examining questions of equity and human happiness. The type I versus type II framework helps to advance public debates about energy that address broad questions of profitability, regulation, and the environment, and in the process poses fundamental questions about the reverence for energy growth in advanced technological societies.
Social Issues	Science has been dazzlingly successful in explaining nature. Scientific advances also have led to certain undesirable, though unintended, side effects, one of which is alienation from the spiritual. Revelation comes from the Divine. But what is the status of authenticity of a particular piece claimed to be revelation? What is its historical validity and current state of preservation ? This essay proposes to develop a list of rational criteria, in consultation with all stakeholders, for addressing the subject. The aim is to bring objectivity into this discourse by placing it more on the turf of reason rather than basing it on considerations of faith and prior allegiance.
Cultural Studies	This paper looks at the interplay between creative industries' and cultural policy' in France. We analyse how university stakeholder communities in the field of elite vocational training schools for applied arts' such as Bande dessinee (comics and animation) and videogaming negotiate the over simplistically reified relationship between public policies in the arts and the creative sector. The analysis relates the case-studies' of the ENJMIN (a national videogames school in Angouleme) to the long-standing French technocratic traditions of creating elite graduate schools in all fields of public policy, and, increasingly, in the creative sector. The study assesses the tension between the speed of response of policy in a rapidly changing economic environment and the creation of institutions that are supportive and respective and can deliver in a sustainable and substantial way. The paper explores how French policy manages the conflict between complex HE institutions involving loosely coupled communities with varying degrees of mutual commitment and self-identification and the creative industries as a complex, politically charged, and often emotionally laden field.
Linguistics	This paper highlights certain semantic similarities and differences between the descriptive adjective debeo, -la, -lo in Serbian and its English equivalent fat. A multi-faceted approach is used to perform a collocational and componential analysis of the collocates extracted from various corpora. A contrastive analysis is also undertaken. Furthermore, a specific emphasis is placed on the presence of grammatical gender in Serbian, and the lack of such gender in English. Thus, the results of the analysis illustrate how the semantic (and grammatical) aspects of these adjectives in the two languages are reflected in the use of the words and how they collocate. In addition, the collocational framework of the adjective debeo, -la, -lo in Serbian was found to change, based both on the grammatical gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), and also on the sequence of its near synonyms. The same changes were not found in English which lacks grammatical gender. The paper uses electronic databases and corpora to analyse the frequency of the collocations found for the selected adjectives in both languages. The results suggest that there are distinct idiomatic meanings to the analysed adjectives in both Serbian and English.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	As economies, societies, and environments change, official statistics evolve and develop to reflect those changes. In reaction to disruptive innovations arising from globalisation, technological advances, and cultural changes, the pace of change of official statistics will accelerate in the future. The motivation for change may also be more existential than that of the past as official statisticians consider the survival of their discipline. This article examines some of the emerging developments and questions whether they present threats or offer opportunities.
Health Policy & Services	"Objective To assess hospital unit culture and clinician attitudes associated with varying rates of primary cesarean delivery. Data Sources/Study Setting Intrapartum nurses, midwives, and physicians recruited from 79 hospitals in California participating in efforts to reduce cesarean overuse. Study Design Labor unit culture and clinician attitudes measured using a survey were linked to the California Maternal Data Center for birth outcomes and hospital covariates. Methods Association with primary cesarean delivery rates was assessed using multivariate Poisson regression adjusted for hospital covariates. Principal Findings 1718 respondents from 70 hospitals responded to the Labor Culture Survey. The ""Unit Microculture"" subscale was strongly associated with primary cesarean rate; the higher a unit scored on 8-items describing a culture supportive of vaginal birth (eg, nurses are encouraged to spend time in rooms with patients, and doulas are welcomed), the cesarean rate decreased by 41 percent (95% CI = -47 to -35 percent, P < 0.001). Discordant attitudes between nurses and physicians were associated with increased cesarean rates. Conclusions Hospital unit culture, clinician attitudes, and consistency between professions are strongly associated with primary cesarean rates. Improvement efforts to reduce cesarean overuse must address culture of care as a key part of the change process."
Business	Virtual Reality (VR) technologies enable marketers to design websites that simulate experiential consumption (e.g., museum visits, leisure travel) closely. While the motivation for employing VR-style websites is to attract people to consume the experience in real life, we proposed and found that VR-style (vs. traditional) websites may dissuade them from future consumption (Study 1). We argued that perceived similarity between virtual and real experiences mediates this negative effect. Study 2 suggested that because peoples enduring involvement with a product determines their ability to discriminate well between episodes of product experience, it causes variation in both perceived similarity and consumption intention, with the former mediating the latter. Study 3 showed that this negative effect reversed in experiences in which perceived similarity was low. Study 4 demonstrated that this negative effect disappeared when perceived similarity is irrelevant to the consumption decision, for example, when the decision is whether or not to recommend the experience to a friend.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Beginning the nineteenth-century and continuing down to the present, many authors writing on the history of geology and paleontology have attributed the theory that fossils were inorganic formations produced within the earth, rather than by the deposition of living organisms, to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Some have even gone so far as to claim this was the consensus view in the classical period up through the Middle Ages. In fact, such a notion was entirely foreign to ancient and medieval thought and only appeared within the manifold of 'Renaissance episteme,' the characteristics of which have often been projected backwards by some historians onto earlier periods. This paper endeavors to correct this error, explain the development of the Renaissance view, describe certain ancient precedents thereof, and trace the history of the misinterpretation in the literature.
Substance Abuse	Background and Objectives: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic disorder with relapse based on both desire for reinforcement (craving) and avoidance of withdrawal. The aversive aspect of dependence and relapse has been associated with a small brain structure called the habenula, which expresses large numbers of both opioid and nicotinic receptors. Additionally, opioid withdrawal symptoms can be induced in opioid-treated rodents by blocking not only opioid, but also nicotinic receptors. This receptor co-localization and cross-induction of withdrawal therefore might lead to genetic variation in the nicotinic receptor influencing development of human opioid dependence through its impact on the aversive components of opioid dependence. Methods: We studied habenular resting state functional connectivity with related brain structures, specifically the striatum. We compared abstinent psychiatric patients who use opioids (N = 51) to psychiatric patients who do not (N = 254) to identify an endophenotype of opioid use that focused on withdrawal avoidance and aversion rather than the more commonly examined craving aspects of relapse. Results: We found that habenula-striatal connectivity was stronger in opioid-using patients. Increased habenula-striatum connectivity was observed in opioid-using patients with the low risk rs16969968 GG genotype, but not in patients carrying the high risk AG or AA genotypes. Conclusions: We propose that increased habenula-striatum functional connectivity may be modulated by the nicotinic receptor variant rs16969968 and may lead to increased opioid use. Scientific Significance: Our data uncovered a promising brain target for development of novel anti-addiction therapies and may help the development of personalized therapies against opioid abuse.
Information Science & Library Science	Educational establishments continue to seek opportunities to rationalize the way they manage their resources. The economic crisis that befell the world following the near collapse of the global financial system and the subsequent bailouts of local banks with billions of tax payers' money will continue to affect educational establishments that are likely to discover that governments will have less money than before to invest in them. It is argued in this article that cloud computing is likely to be one of those opportunities sought by the cash-strapped educational establishments in these difficult times and could prove to be of immense benefit (and empowering in some situations) to them clue to its flexibility and pay-as-you-go cost structure. Cloud computing is an emerging new computing paradigm for delivering computing services. This computing approach relies on a number of existing technologies, e.g., the Internet, virtualization, grid computing. Web services, etc. The provision of this service in a pay-as-you-go way through (largely) the popular medium of the Internet gives this service a new distinctiveness. In this article, some aspects of this distinctiveness will be highlighted and some light will be shed on the current concerns that might be preventing some organizations from adopting it.

Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Due to recent deaths of known enforcers in professional hockey, the role of fighting in the sport has come under increased scrutiny. This study examines the role of fighting, along with other factors, as it relates to attendance in the top developmental minor league for the NHL, the American Hockey League (AHL). AHL fans are shown to respond favorably to fighting, with more fans attending games when the home team fights more often. Fans are also shown to respond to the opponent and to a wide range of promotions, which were tabulated from team websites and included in the model.
Communication	This article examines the film Catfish and the corresponding television program Catfish: The TV Show to articulate how genres of the real create entertainment paradigms built on shame and derision as acceptable modes of programming particularly focused on bodies. Understanding these texts as visual culture narratives grounded in shame produced through failed classed, fat, and gendered bodies, I argue that when genres of the real focus on shame as entertainment they implicate individuals, rather than systemically enforced normative identity positions, as wholly complicit in their own sociocultural failure.
Geography	Increasing tree canopy cover has led to increasing wildfire activity in conifer dominated areas of the southwestern United States. Estimating historical changes in the spatial distribution of tree canopy cover can provide further insights into the dynamics of forest and fuel conditions in these landscapes and help prioritize areas for restoration to mitigate wildfire risks and restore biological functioning. In this study, we explored the relationship between LiDAR derived canopy cover data and Landsat reflectance values, and derived a model to estimate percent canopy cover (PCC) on historical Landsat data from 1987 to 2015 for the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), located in the southwest Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. We developed a regression model between LiDAR generated canopy cover collected in June 2010 and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) reflectance values (bands 1-7 except band 6) and vegetation indices collected for the same date. About 5% (17,000) of the total LiDAR points (329,102) were used as training points and a separate, non-overlapping set of 17,000 points as test points to validate the regression model. A simple linear model with the red band (band 3; R-2 = 0.70) was selected as the best model to predict PCC in the rest of the images for 1987-2015. In general, we found a strong consistency between the spatial dynamics of modelled tree canopy cover based on historical Landsat data, wildfire events and forest management practices that occurred during the same period. Results showed that about 11% of the study area experienced an increase in PCC for the period of 1987-2015 while 41% of the study area experienced a reduction in PCC during the same time period, mostly in the areas which were affected by stand replacing wildfires in 2011 and 2013. The results indicate an overall increase in medium and high canopy cover classes in specific regions of the study area, which could lead to hazardous wildfires such as those in 2011 and 2013. In the context of ongoing ecological restoration of these montane forests, predicted PCC of contemporary forests could help local managers to identify the areas in the need of immediate restoration efforts by focusing management practices on the areas with closed canopy.
Sociology	"Gaslighting-a type of psychological abuse aimed at making victims seem or feel ""crazy,"" creating a ""surreal"" interpersonal environment-has captured public attention. Despite the popularity of the term, sociologists have ignored gaslighting, leaving it to be theorized by psychologists. However, this article argues that gaslighting is primarily a sociological rather than a psychological phenomenon. Gaslighting should be understood as rooted in social inequalities, including gender, and executed in power-laden intimate relationships. The theory developed here argues that gaslighting is consequential when perpetrators mobilize gender-based stereotypes and structural and institutional inequalities against victims to manipulate their realities. Using domestic violence as a strategic case study to identify the mechanisms via which gaslighting operates, I reveal how abusers mobilize gendered stereotypes; structural vulnerabilities related to race, nationality, and sexuality; and institutional inequalities against victims to erode their realities. These tactics are gendered in that they rely on the association of femininity with irrationality. Gaslighting offers an opportunity for sociologists to theorize under-recognized, gendered forms of power and their mobilization in interpersonal relationships."
Social Work	This study provides a case example of a Somali Bantu refugee's resettlement journey in order to explore how to better meet the needs of future refugees. As the number of refugees grows, it is essential for social work professionals to actively explore various options to address global refugee concerns.
Public Administration	Public organizations operate as open systems in settings that can be a source of difficulties for managers and for program performance. The unexpected arrival of two major hurricanes in 2005 caused widespread havoc, and some of the consequences constituted major shocks to public agencies-in particular, to public educational systems. This article assesses whether such shocks caused drops in performance, and whether organization and management contributed to a mitigation of these deleterious effects. Evidence indicates that shocks do disrupt performance but also that staff capacity and stability in street-level personnel of the organizations can reduce or eliminate these negative consequences.
Substance Abuse	Recently, we reported that naltrexone at 150 mg/day significantly decreased cocaine and alcohol use for men but not women with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence. The present study is an exploratory investigation of predictors that explain the different gender responses to naltrexone, with a particular focus on differential predictors of treatment attrition. No significant predictors were associated with treatment discontinuation in men. Women, however, were more likely to discontinue treatment when reporting severe pre-treatment psychiatric problems or nausea while in treatment. Further research on the impact of pre-treatment and in-treatment gender differences with naltrexone is warranted.
Gerontology	The substantial and increasing number of older Australian people from culturally diverse backgrounds justifies the investigation and inclusion of their experiences in ageing research. Few empirical studies have addressed culturally diverse issues in the older population, however, in part because of the particular challenges in recruiting and retaining people from different cultural backgrounds. This article reflects on a research team's experience of recruiting participants from seven cultural groups into a study that sought to explore the links between physical activity and the built environment. Three key issues for recruiting and retaining participants from culturally diverse backgrounds were identified: having access to key local informants; the central role of paid and trained bilingual interviewers; and supporting the research partners in recruitment activities. Furthermore, it appeared that a 'one size fits all' approach was not appropriate and that a flexible recruitment strategy may be required to ensure successful recruitment from all cultural groups. The differences observed in this study relating to recruitment and retention rates may be more dependent on the skills and characteristics of those responsible for the recruitment and interviewing, rather than the specific cultural group itself Older people from some cultural backgrounds may be less likely to respond to traditional recruitment methods and researchers need to be more assiduous and strategic to improve participation rates in research.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	"Originated by Paul Adler, paleo-Marxism represents the fullest engagement with Marx's work by a management scholar in the American milieu. As the pinnacle of Marxist thinking within Critical Management Studies, paleo-Marxism merits critical attention. By focusing on technological change, Adler aims to overcome contemporary poststructuralist labor process theory's subjectivism. When subjected to a fine-grained analysis, however, paleo-Marxism is revealed to be equally deficient. Adler compounds the labor process theorists' neglect of Marx's discoveries about how capital is valorized; he prioritizes the subjective matter of recognition at the expense of redistribution; and he fails to explain adequately the crisis potential of technical progress. Only a wholly new Marxist version of Critical Management Studies, one with a ""crisis sites"" model at its core, can surmount paleo-Marxism's inherent weaknesses."
History & Philosophy Of Science	According to the principle of epistemic closure, knowledge is closed under known implication. The principle is intuitive but it is problematic in some cases. Suppose you know you have hands and you know that 'I have hands' implies 'I am not a brain-in-a-vat'. Does it follow that you know you are not a brain-in-a-vat? It seems not; it should not be so easy to refute skepticism. In this and similar cases, we are confronted with a puzzle: epistemic closure is an intuitive principle, but at times, it does not seem that we know by implication. In response to this puzzle, the literature has been mostly polarized between those who are willing to do away with epistemic closure and those who think we cannot live without it. But there is a third way. Here I formulate a restricted version of the principle of epistemic closure. In the standard version, the principle can range over any proposition; in the restricted version, it can only range over those propositions that are within the limits of a given epistemic inquiry and that do not constitute the underlying assumptions of the inquiry. If we adopt the restricted version, I argue, we can preserve the advantages associated with closure, while at the same time avoiding the puzzle I've described. My discussion also yields an insight into the nature of knowledge. I argue that knowledge is best understood as a topic-restricted notion, and that such a conception is a natural one given our limited cognitive resources.
Education, Special	The present study aimed to explore the impact of the combination of two pedagogical models, Sport Education and Teaching for Personal and Social Responsibility, for learners with disabilities experiencing a contactless kickboxing learning unit. Twelve secondary education students agreed to participate. Five had disabilities (intellectual and motor). Additionally,three physical education teachers and the mother of one of the students contributed. Five different research instruments were used to obtain information from all participants: drawings, open-ended questions, discussion groups, diaries and semi-structured interviews. Thematic content analysis and constant comparison guided data analysis resulted in three major categories: part of the team, learning and enjoyment. Several ideas were also identified: inclusion, friendship, cooperation, students' important role and transference. In conclusion, the hybridisation of Sport Education and Teaching for Personal and Social Responsibility seems to be a powerful tool for including students with disabilities in physical education, helping them and their classmates connect in and out of class.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Mobilities of money, symbols and young people themselves are central to the formation of the contemporary youth period. While rural young people remain marginal to theoretical development in youth studies, this paper shows that mobilities are especially significant for rural youth, who experience a kind of mobility imperative created by the accelerating concentration of economic and cultural capital in cities. Drawing on theory and evidence from contexts including Europe, Australia, Africa and South America, this paper explores the mobility imperative for rural youth and offers a new theoretical framework for understanding rural youth mobilities. The framework understands mobilities across three dimensions: the structural, the symbolic and the nonrepresentational. These dimensions refer to material inequalities between rural and urban places in a global context; symbolic hierarchies that concentrate the resources for 'youthfulness' in cities and the affective entanglements between embodied subjectivities and spaces that emerge as young people move. The paper shows how these dimensions interact in the production and experience of the mobility imperative, offering an ontological and theoretical platform for future research into rural youth mobilities.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	While risk research normally understands risk as an entity that can be calculated using statistics and probabilities - and which therefore also can become the object of insurance technology - it is the production of new, non-calculable risks and therefore also risks that cannot be insured against, which is at the centre of Ulrich Beck's risk society theory. The article examines Beck's conceptualization of risk and discusses how he has clarified and further refined the concept since publishing Risk Society in 1986. The article shows, first, how Beck understands risk as an entity that is neither danger nor risk in the traditional sense but rather something in between, which he refers to as man-made disasters' and new risks'. The discussion then addresses Beck's position in relation to the ontological status of risk, which is an intermediate position between realism and constructivism. The non-calculability and non-insurability of the new risks are also examined. The article discusses what it means that the new risks are not visible and the significance of non-knowledge for how we understand them. Finally, the new conditions of existence for politics, states and individuals are outlined in the aftermath of Beck's risk society theory. The article concludes with a discussion of the analytical potential of the theory.
Demography	Emotional influences on fertility behaviors are an understudied topic that may offer a clear explanation of why many couples choose to have children even when childbearing is not economically rational. With setting-specific measures of the husband-wife emotional bond appropriate for large-scale population research matched with data from a long-term panel study, we have the empirical tools to provide a test of the influence of emotional factors on contraceptive use to limit fertility. This article presents those tests. We use long-term, multilevel community and family panel data to demonstrate that the variance in levels of husband-wife emotional bond is significantly associated with their subsequent use of contraception to avert births. We discuss the wide-ranging implications of this intriguing new result.
Health Policy & Services	Mental disorders are a major contributor to the disease burden in Europe. We studied how research on them was communicated to British and Irish newspaper readers through an analysis of stories in the Daily Mail (DML) and The Guardian (GDN) in the UK and the Irish Times (IET) in Ireland, in 2002-13, and whether the coverage reflected the relative burdens of mental disorders, or the amount of research, in the two countries. The cited papers were identified through the newspapers' archive or the Factiva database, and their details and those of the research they cited from the Web of Science, with 1,128 stories in total. Alzheimer's and other dementias was the leading UK press research topic, but depression was for Ireland. The countries whose research was most cited were the United States, followed by Canada and Europe, notably the UK and Ireland in their respective newspapers. Over 68% of the Irish research papers cited by IET were supported by the state, compared with only 38% of all Irish mental disorders research. The UK newspapers had many stories on lifestyle factors (DML) or drug treatments (GDN); IET gave more space to epidemiology. The UK papers gave little attention to non-drug treatments. Many stories quoted commentators, who in the UK were often charities, but the IET tended to use academics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Transportation	The seizure by Somali pirates of the Saudi-owned VLCC, the Sirius Star, with its crew, in November 2008, captured international attention. Across the world, regular updates were given and the ransom demands discussed and debated in the press. Dramatic footage was shown on national television of the payment of the ransom by parachute and footage of the debacle which followed where some of the pirates were drowned. Until then, most of the non-shipping world thought of pirates as the romantic buccaneers aka Hollywood. However, the cost of piracy to industry and its impact on international trade cannot be ignored. There are potential geopolitical repercussions. Despite international efforts, piracy in this region threatens to put a chokehold on one of the world's busiest shipping arteries. Shipping lines are taking decisions to avoid the area, rerouting via the Cape of Good Hope. This article provides a methodology to measure the costs of piracy from the shipping company's perspective by taking a comparative voyage costing approach.
Urban Studies	"A growing body of research using the direct demand model has explored the impact of the built environment on transit ridership. However, empirical studies identified various significant factors in different cities with different datasets. This study adopts points-of-interest (POIs) data to identify the physical environmental factors affecting metro ridership in Shanghai. Independent variables in terms of the rail transit system, external connectivity, intermodal connection, and land use factors within 286 metro stations"" catchment areas were selected. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to group POIs into 6 components for dimensionality reduction. The results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis emphasize the dominating role of commercial land use and rail transit system factors, together with bus stops, tourist spots and healthcare factors, positively impact both weekday and weekend metro ridership; however, the effect of job-related land use is significant only on weekdays. Distinctively, the variable of intersection density is not positively associated with ridership as expected, revealing that street network measurements may not explain walking to rail transit in the citywide Shanghai context, so we suggest a new requirement: a multilevel-based walkability index in dense cities. The latter finding also implied that residences in central locations are less reliable than those in suburban locations. Finally, we conclude with strategies to encourage balanced trip demands other than simply increasing ridership, which has potential implications on urban planning and transit-oriented development (TOD) in China."
Women'S Studies	"This paper explores the reasons for women's migration from Korea to the UK. It is difficult to explain away this migration with the common rationales, such as a gendered international division of labour or a strong political/colonial relationship between two countries. This study proposes a gendered desire approach to understand young women's migration: rather than a single motivating factor such as an economic purpose, the desire for new way of life-including the expectation of better social circumstances as well as realistic needs for future careers-triggers women's migration. I will look at individual migrant women's life stories, applying the biographical approach within the framework of gendered desire. Their memories of family, school life, and work show how the Korean social atmosphere emphasises becoming a ""global citizen"" influences these women's migration in a gendered way.

Public Administration	A prevention framework represents one of the fundamental means of the Australian Government's contemporary drive to achieve permanent reductions in homelessness. Consistent with prevailing policies in the UK and US, Australia has approached homelessness prevention through identification and early intervention of individuals at risk of homelessness. In this article we suggest that prevention strategies focused on the risk factors that individual pose obscures efforts to address the underlying structural factors that contribute to homelessness, or to reduce the prevalence of homelessness at the overall population level. The article examines the efficacy of increasing the supply of affordable housing to prevent homelessness, but suggests that the provision of housing alone may be insufficient to realising related well-being objectives. In turn, it is proposed that policy which focuses on poverty reduction has the capacity to achieve the sustainable prevention of homelessness ambitions.
Family Studies	Previous research has suggested that religiosity is associated with positive marital outcomes, but the underlying reasons for this association are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that religion influences marriage via partner selection strategies. Specifically, we hypothesized that proximal (more than distal) religiosity would predict partner selection strategies that facilitates positive marital outcomes; we also conducted exploratory analyses examining the influence of religious affiliation. Using a novel methodology that allowed for an examination of explicit and implicit attitudes, we tested our hypotheses using a large sample of emerging adults (N = 437). Findings indicate that religion influences partner selection preferences, but the effect is not uniformly positive. Religious affiliation, not individual level religiosity (distal or proximal), was the most robust predictor of mate-selection preferences. Possible explanations for these findings and implications for intervention are discussed.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	BACKGROUND: Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) professionals are key players in workplace regulation compliance and promotion of health. OBJECTIVES: To assess OSH professionals' perceptions of the concept of work ability in an attempt to explain the varied, and in some cases failure of, implementation of regulations and policies. METHOD: An electronic questionnaire sent to approved Occupational Health Services (OHS) in Norway asked several questions, including one on the concept of work ability. Responses from OSH professionals in the OHS serving cleaning companies were analysed for commonalities and dissimilarities, thereby establishing some perception patterns. RESULTS: OSH professionals from 40 OHS included in the study responded with explanations characterized by variations. Some included elaborate aspects in the explanations, others ranged from simple to lacking aspects of explanation compared to an identified benchmark definition. CONCLUSION: There are significant comprehension disparities in the understanding of the concept of work ability. Correct understanding of the concepts and constructs in a given regulatory framework are tantamount to the proper implementation of the requirements of the regulation provisions. There is a need to streamline and improve the understanding of OSH professionals in order to ensure uniformity of purpose, and hence fulfilment of the vision of the regulation in focus.
Law	This article shows how the political, historical, sociological, and economic narrative of Ibn Khaldun influenced the conjunction of elements that were essential to the civilizing language promoted by European and American liberals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 'standard of civilization' has experienced a revival among critical legal scholars. These authors have reconstructed a historical process of 'rise, fall, and rise' of the 'standard of civilization', identifying its reappearance in an era of globalization and global governance with the current existence of a (neo-)colonial paradigm in international law and a (neo-) liberal global economy. This study is divided into three parts intended to examine in depth the precursory role of this Islamic thinker in the shaping of civilizing language. The first part examines IbnKhaldun's life as away of understanding his thinking on civilization. The second part explores the influence of Ibn Khaldun's work on the discourse surrounding the standard of civilization, by reintroducing the interpretation of Rafael Altamira (1866-1951). The third starts with Ibn Khaldun's writings on economic science and Joseph Spengler's (1902-1991) approach to his works. Several Islamic economic institutions and their influence on the state and concept of international society are examined. The revival of Ibn Khaldun's thinking is partly intended to fill an existing gap in the studies of medieval Islamic theorists. By examining his ideas about the socio-political and economic viability of a dynasty (or a civilization or a state), this article attempts to shed light on the intercultural origins of international law.
Public Administration	It is often difficult to meaningfully convey concepts like security incident management cycle, information sharing, cooperation, as well as the roles of people, processes and technology in cybersecurity courses. Serious gaming can help solve this problem, since it can provide a more immersive and interactive learning experience than traditional methods. This paper presents a light weight tabletop exercise format that has been successfully used in cybersecurity education to demonstrate these and many other concepts to Master level students in two European universities over the past 5 years. The term light weight is chosen to indicate the low work load and resource requirements for the instructor. The paper provides practical guidance on how to develop and execute such exercises. In addition, it lists observations of concepts and recommended discussion points that have been successfully demonstrated in class using this exercise format.
Business	In this article, we analyze the influence of sociodemographic factors and consumer attitudes toward direct marketing products and sources (outlets) on the frequency of buying food from farmers' markets and farm shops. By conducting an intercept survey with pedestrians in 2011 and 2012, we interviewed a total of n=550 consumers. The target regions of the study were the Eastern German federal states. The study uses two ordered logit regression models to investigate consumers' shopping behaviour at farmers' markets and farm shops separately. We find that different factors significantly influence consumers' buying behaviour at the two direct marketing outlets. Specifically, both a more favorable view toward the freshness of directly marketed foods and the intention to support local producers are positively related to consumers' purchase frequency from farmers' markets. In contrast, consumers' purchase frequency from farm shops is significantly influenced by their perception of the cost of the products, confidence in food producers of directly marketed products, perception of the safety of the food and perception of the accessibility of farm shops. The study results indicate that considering consumer behaviour separately for different direct marketing channels for food rather than considering the entire category of local food outlets may provide new and valuable insights.
Public Administration	In the past several years, a number of countries have substantially reformed the administrative structures of their national museums in order to make these institutions more popular, efficient and profitable. This has led to a certain shift in the way national museums' traditional public missions are viewed. By favouring administrative decentralization and self-financing strategies, several of these reforms have also helped to shape the functions traditionally performed by museums by encouraging activities that are more likely to generate income rather than behind-the-scenes activities such as research. In light of the major administrative changes being made at national museums, this article aims to examine research as a public mission of Canada's national museums, in order to determine the impact of these reforms on the administration and regulation procedures that apply to this important yet albeit very discreet museological function. Beginning with the discussions focusing on the decentralization of heritage in the 1980s, and going through the dissolution of the National Museums of Canada Corporation in 1987 and the implementation of strategic planning systems in the 1990s, we note a gradual decrease in professional self-regulation as it applies to curators, as well as a certain decline in curators' academic autonomy in terms of their ability to control research activity initiatives.
Substance Abuse	Hispanic adolescents have been shown to have high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and HIV and substance abuse has been linked to risky sexual behaviors. The literature indicates that good parent-adolescent communication about sexual risk and safe sexual behaviors may help protect youth, yet little is known about this type of communication in Hispanic families. This article reports data on adolescent and parent factors associated with communication about moral and birth control talk between 108 Hispanic substance abusing adolescents and their parents. Results indicate that Hispanic parents who had older adolescents, reported more involvement, were less concerned of possible negative reactions from their child, and felt more knowledgeable and confident regarding sex and birth control also reported greater frequency of birth control talk. Hispanic parents with a daughter, who reported more involvement, or whose child reported more communication were more likely to report greater frequency of talking about moral issues.
Sociology	This article examines the promotion of private life insurance in Finland between 1945 and 1990. Although a fully-fledged social insurance system was established during this period, private insurance did not become obsolete. How were people encouraged to engage in voluntary forms of insurance in the new situation? We study the ways in which insurance was marketed by justifying its usefulness in relation to the 'goods' that were presumed common to all potential customers. The key theoretical frameworks are given by the literature on 'governmentality' and by Boltanski and Thevenot's model of justifications. The first of these is used in our discussion of the general role of insurance as a multifaceted social technology, whereas we use the model of justifications in analysing the core themes of promotion. The promotional materials reveal that private life insurance is not an attractive economic tool for potential customers without reference to at least some moral justifications. However, these justifications are heterogeneous and open to change. In addition, the question of which particular moral emphasis seems most relevant, and when, is related to socio-economic transformations. Especially important are the changes in the interplay between social and private forms of organizing insurance responsibility.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Foodservice employees that fail to adhere to food safety practices may directly introduce pathogens that can cause illness and death. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore managerial practices that influence employee's food safety behaviors, using a two-phase sequential mixed-method approach. A total of 642 foodservice employees currently working in the United States participated in a survey about food safety knowledge and food safety behavioral intentions. Among these, 263 were invited to answer a set of open-ended qualitative questions, 36 participants responded to the questions, and two participants were selected for in-depth interviews. The majority of the employees are optimistic about their daily food safety practices. However, cross-analyses noted that the majority of employees failed the quiz regarding basic food safety knowledge. Further analyses documented that time-constraint and lack of managerial role modeling in daily food safety practices can post a considerable threat to maintaining food safety behaviors.
Education, Special	A multiple-probe, multiple-baseline, across-subjects design was used to examine the writing performance of four low-achieving adult students with and without disabilities enrolled in general equivalency diploma (GED) preparatory classes. Students' writing was evaluated before instruction and after self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) instruction for the POW (Pick my idea-pay attention to the prompt, Organize, Write and say more) + TREE (Topic sentence, Reasons, Explanations, Ending) + COPS (Capitalize, Organize, Punctuate, Sense) strategies. Results following the instruction indicated that students had learned to independently write expository essays. The number of essay parts and transition words increased, demonstrating evidence of organized essays. The number of words written and descriptive word use also increased. Gains were maintained on maintenance probes. All students who took the GED exam passed the essay-writing portion following the intervention.
History	Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of visual representations and written texts, this study argues that officers, civil officials, and urban professionals who came of age in the late Hamidian era adopted the mustache as an expression of a generational identification and a related self-consciously modern masculinity that defined itself against the bearded, Hamidian order. After 1908, when the instigators of the revolution and their supporters climbed up the social and political hierarchies, the mustache rose with them and became the facial ornament of the most powerful people in the empire. Considering the common association of the mustache with youth, its adoption as a marker of identification hints at the unsettling of longtime ageist hierarchies but also, at the durability and adaptability of gender ones.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Tourism is a major export industry for Thailand. Phuket, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, has been negatively influenced in recent years by a number of crises, including the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). This has limited the travel budget not only for domestic tourists but also those from overseas. Hotel businesses have been particularly affected by the GFC. While hotel managers may not be able anticipate a crisis, it is crucial for them to understand the critical success factors contributing to effective crisis recovery in order to ensure their long-term survival.This research identifies critical success factors necessary for effective economic crisis management through qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with managers of Phuket hotels. The findings of these interviews provide a rich and meaningful understanding of pertinent factors emphasized by managers as important in crisis recovery.
Management	Organizational performance is often dependent on the timing of critical processes and the simultaneous use of both technology and routines. Existing publications emphasize the importance of time sensitivity but also reflect divergent, untested perspectives. Prior works do not clearly explain or examine how different mechanisms are associated with achieving time-sensitive versus general (or non-time-sensitive) performance. We build on concepts from organizational mindfulness and organizational routines to address these gaps. Specifically, this paper examines how the mindful use of information technologies and adherence to specified routines are associated with both time-sensitive and general organizational performance. We employ split-group structural equation modeling based on high and low levels of information technology adoption to account for potential technology contingencies in performance. We use time-sequenced data from 262 U.S. hospitals to analyze two categories of clinical care quality: time-sensitive care and general care. The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with both time-sensitive and general performance in contexts with high technology adoption but not in those with low adoption. In contrast, adherence to specified routines is associated with time-sensitive performance in contexts with low technology adoption but not in those with high adoption. The results also clarify that high levels of technology adoption and mindful use may at times assume the place of specified routines in their association with time-sensitive performance. Finally, we find evidence that continuous improvement may bridge adherence to specified routines and mindful use of technologies.
Criminology & Penology	This article compares the effects of indeterminate and determinate sentencing models on recidivism using a measure of parole board discretionary release and mandatory parole release under each sentencing model. Data collected from Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1994: United States are used to conduct a state-specific comparison of the two release programs in six mixed-sentencing states. The results indicate that the effects of different sentencing models significantly vary across the six states. Whereas mandatory parole release was more likely to have a deterrent effect on recidivism in Maryland and Virginia, parole board discretionary release was more effective in New York and North Carolina. Release programs in Oregon and Texas showed no significant differences in their effects on recidivism.
Ethnic Studies	Based on fieldwork that aimed to gather more knowledge on female genital cutting among Kurdish-Norwegians, in this article we report on how research participants would often talk about male circumcision instead. Informed by current scholarship and public discourse on female genital cutting and male circumcision, we identified three themes when analysing how and why the participants would talk about male circumcision rather than female genital cutting: (1) the condemnation of female genital cutting; (2) the acceptability of male circumcision and (3) the questioning of the acceptability of male circumcision. We do not attempt to provide solutions to whether some forms of male circumcision are less, equally or more harmful than some forms of female genital cutting, or whether they are comparable and both should thus either be legitimized or banned. Rather we aim to provide insights into these dilemmas by the use of the concept of 'mapping controversies' associated with actor-network theory. We further make use of the slippery slope argument to explore how the research participants' views shed light on political reluctance to treat female genital cutting and male circumcision in the same way in the Norwegian context. While we are not in a position to say that the views shared are the same in other social groups, or in other countries, we argue that the Norwegian government's different treatment of female genital cutting and male circumcision changes the meaning of ritual boy circumcision and that this may result in parents deciding not to circumcise their sons.
Sociology	Material and physical threat can play a crucial role in the emergence of protest, yet few studies have explored the micro-level mechanisms that transform threat into collective action under repressive conditions. We address this gap by connecting the mobilizing power of grievances to the emotional dynamics of collective action in the context of a 1953 uprising in Communist Czechoslovakia. Following economic reforms that wiped out citizens' savings, several thousand workers in the industrial city of Plzen took to the streets in protest. Drawing on data from in-depth interviews, our analysis shows how structural and incidental grievances can become a mobilizing force for high-risk activism. We find that the class position of protesters influenced their preexisting affective state and reactive response to the reform. As a result, class background helped to shape protesters' motivations, actions, and goals. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research.
Health Policy & Services	Maternal and child mortality rates remain unacceptably high globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A popular approach to counter these high rates is interventions delivered using mobile phones (mHealth). However, few mHealth interventions have been implemented nationwide and there has been little evaluation of their effectiveness, particularly at scale. Therefore, we evaluated the Rwanda RapidSMS programme-one of the few mHealth programmes in Africa that is currently operating nationwide. Using interrupted time series analysis and monthly data routinely reported by public health centres (n = 461) between 2012 and 2016, we studied the impact of RapidSMS on four indicators: completion of four antenatal care visits, deliveries in a health facility, postnatal care visits and malnutrition screening. We stratified all analyses based on whether the district received concurrent additional supports, including staff and equipment (10 out of 30 Districts). We found that community health workers in Rwanda sent more than 9.3 million messages using RapidSMS, suggesting the programme was successfully implemented. We found that the implementation of the RapidSMS system combined with additional support including training, supervision and equipment provision increased the use of maternal and child health services. In contrast, implementing the RapidSMS system alone was ineffective. This suggests that mHealth programmes alone may be insufficient to improve the use of health services. Instead, they should be considered as a part of more comprehensive interventions that provide the necessary equipment and health system capacity to support them.
History	"This article analyses free and unfree labour in mining centres in the Andes during early Spanish colonial times. It focuses on two themes: the condition of indigenous or ""native'' people as ""free labourers'', and the mita system of unfree labour. For that purpose I shall consider the cases of Potosi, the most important mining centre in the Andes, and San Antonio del Nuevo Mundo in southern Bolivia, a large mine unaffected by the mita system of labour obligations."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	A convergence of contextual factors, technological platforms and research frameworks in the genomics of the human brain and cognition has generated a new postgenomic model for the study of race and IQ. Centered on the case study of Bruce T. Lahn's 2005 claims about the genomic basis of racial differences in brain size and IQ, this article maps the disciplinary terrain of this research, analyzes its central claims and examines the rigor of critical debate within the genomics community about new race and IQ research. New postgenomic race and IQ research, while displaying some continuities with previous eras of racial science, also differs in important ways, both contextual and conceptual. In particular, this new research draws on methods and hypotheses that are widely accepted across many fields of the contemporary molecular genetic sciences. This has implications for the forms of critical engagement that science studies scholars might pursue. BioSocieties (2011) 6, 420-446. doi: 10.1057/biosoc.2011.20; published online 17 October 2011
Anthropology	"Renewed interest in fission-fusion dynamics is due to the recognition that such dynamics may create unique challenges for social interaction and distinctive selective pressures acting on underlying communicative and cognitive abilities. New frameworks for integrating current knowledge on fission-fusion dynamics emerge from a fundamental rethinking of the term ""fission-fusion"" away from its current general use as a label for a particular modal type of social system (i.e., ""fission-fusion societies""). Specifically, because the degree of spatial and temporal cohesion of group members varies both within and across taxa, any social system can be described in terms of the extent to which it expresses fission-fusion dynamics. This perspective has implications for socioecology, communication, cognitive demands, and human social evolution."
Education & Educational Research	This study examines the work of US school principals from the perspective of their workday using a distributed perspective to frame the investigation. Using data on 38 school principals in one mid-sized urban school district in the US, it describes school principals' work practices, examining both the focus of that work and how it is accomplished. Cluster analysis is used to analyse data from an experience sampling method (ESM) log, identifying three patterns of practice: administration-centred, solo practitioners, and people-centred. To explicate these patterns, qualitative interview and observation data were combined with quantitative survey and log data to construct mini-cases of three principals, each representing one of the three patterns of practice. The study concludes with a discussion of how this analysis both confirms and challenges popular portrayals of the school principal in the literature.
Transportation	This paper explores the possibility of using recorded road slope data in order to reduce fuel consumption for off-road construction vehicles such as articulated haulers. Road gradients have strong influence on the fuel consumption of a vehicle. This effect is even more significant on construction vehicles due to their large mass and heavy load. In this study, a control algorithm based on model predictive control and dynamic programming is formulated and solved to find an optimal gear shift sequence and time of shifting. The fuel consumption model of an articulated hauler is formulated with a dynamic model and used together with the travel time in the objective function to balance the trade-off between these two aspects. The proposed control algorithm is simulated on a typical road stretch on the construction work site with frequent steep up- and downhill. Simulation shows that both fuel consumption and travel time can be reduced simultaneously. In addition, the optimal gear shift sequence resembles the behaviour of an experienced driver.
History	Throughout her career, the Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman accelerated the erosion of boundaries separating the visual arts that has fuelled our current moment of mixed media. This article, though, takes different approach to Akerman's work. It argues that her cinema borrows from a historical type of viewing experience just as much as it pioneered new ones. Specifically, I argue that Akerman drew on the painterly language of seventeenth-century Dutch still-lifes through her use of stillness, texture, space, light, and (self-)portraiture that undermines mainstream modes of visual representation as developed by Renaissance art. Relying on contemporary film theory, art history, and Akerman's own idiosyncratic style and biography, this essay yields a productive, if unexpected, point of comparison between the aesthetic practices of early modern Dutch painting and Akerman's moving images. Comparing several of Akerman's pictures to a handful of masterpieces of seventeenth-century Dutch art, this work joins a growing discourse among visual theorists in exploring connections between cinema and painting more broadly.
Education, Special	The purpose of this review was to examine the methods used to conduct meta-analyses of single-subject research involving students with and at-risk for disabilities. Specifically, the procedures used for preparing, aggregating, analyzing, and evaluating single-subject data across 68 primary syntheses were examined. In addition to these methodological and reporting issues, the present review also considered various characteristics of syntheses to determine their overall prevalence and focus. Results of the review indicated that the publication rate of single-subject meta-analyses has increased considerably in recent years, focusing equally on students with high- and low-incidence disabilities. This review revealed considerable variability in the methods and procedures used to synthesize single-subject research. Based on these findings, suggestions for future single-subject meta-analyses were made.
Women'S Studies	Long regarded as the contemporary Chinese feminist poet par excellencegiving not only voice to Chinese women but feminine sonic mysteriousness to the poetic landscapeZhai Yongming has, in her latest work, apotheosized Chinese women's poetry into the only thing through which relations between Chinese linguistics, historiography, media, and constructions of national and global essence become fully apprehensible. This essay is divided into two parts. Part one investigates Zhai's vision of the relationship between twenty-first-century Chinese feminist poetics and the knowability of modern Chinanot its knowability from a feminist standpoint but its knowability at all. I examine her use of the tropes of feminist recognition to deconstruct a postsinological worldone in which the politics of representing and studying China everywhere circulate and proliferate, one in which what Zhai terms the DNA of the Chinese language morphs alongside gender and global technologies, and one in which ancient and contemporary Chinese histories are broadcasted through transnationally constituted mediascapes. The second part of this essay, focusing on two Sapphic figures whom Zhai hails from the Tang dynasty, unpacks Zhai's ambitious nomination of female poetic virtuosity as the terminus a quo of the next phase of China's poetic revival. I examine how Zhai trades in co-optable historical female personages so as to confront the reader with poetic virtuosity, a confrontation that collapses reading (for) female scandal and reading (for) linguistic revival. For Zhai, I will argue, the political potential of decipherment locked into feminist poetics is ultimately a question of art: not only how is transnationally constituted China knowable? but how can knowing it be pleasurable in ways for which we are already primed? Focusing on the feedback between Zhai's theories of language and culture and her radicalization of feminism's epistemological values, this essay shows the subtle link between twenty-first-century global sinological work from the Chinese literary world and the ongoing project of feminist recovery and revivification.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Chinese tourists, who are increasingly traveling out of Asia independently, need trustworthy and readily available information sources. This study explores the motives of Chinese tourists who have invested considerable time (mostly more than a week) in creating information-rich, influential, and interactive online travel blogseffectively creating personalized little Lonely Planets that serve these growing information needs. This study assesses the demographic characteristics of the Lonely Planets creators, the features of their blogging behavior, and the motivations for the involvement. It reveals six motive categories: positive self-enhancement through online social connection, altruism: being helpful to fellow travelers, social status issues, personal status and achievement, self-documentation and sharing, and hedonic enjoyment of blogging. Superficially, these motivations seem to be similar with previous Western studies of blogging behavior, but significant contextual and cultural issues exist and are explained. Management implications and future research arising from the current study are provided.
Economics	Today inflation targeting regime is often used to conduct monetary policy in most developed economies. In this regime, a central bank manipulates its key interest rate to steer an economy to the objectives it wants to achieve. To implement its monetary policy, Taylor rule is claimed to be a quantitative tool used as a guide for setting interest rate in response to the state of the economy. Despite its widespread popularity, the Taylor rule is just an orientational guidance at best and cannot be followed strictly since it would be against the common practice of conducting monetary policy of most central banks. Therefore, we propose a new rule for inflation targeting monetary policy based on fuzzy control technique. This rule seems to be able to quantify those widely accepted qualitative knowledge on monetary policy. Further, the policy derived by this rule also better captures the common behaviour of central banks. We verify this rule on the monetary policy conducted by the Czech National Bank in the period from 2000 to 2011. We also compare the result of this rule with the results obtained by implementing monetary policy by some other alternative rules.
Substance Abuse	Heat maps are presented here as an innovative technique for evaluating longitudinal drinking outcomes. The Life Transitions Study followed alcohol dependent individuals for 2.5 years during 2004-2009 in a Midwestern city (N = 364). The TimeLine Follow-Back obtained drinking information. Heat map results were compared with those obtained using growth mixture modeling. Heat map classes differed significantly on baseline clinical and demographic indicators. Data were gathered with support from NIAAA R01AA014442.
Education, Special	In the present study, we sought to extend the current literature on utilizing behavioral skills training (BST) to teach practitioners how to implement functional analyses (FA). We used a non-concurrent multiple baseline design across ten participants to measure the effects of a remote BST package on accuracy of implementing FA procedures. The entire remote BST package was delivered via secure remote technology. Each participant experienced four phases which included baseline (only instructions with a simulated client), BST (instructions, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback with a simulated client), post-training probes (probes with a simulated client), and in situ probes (probes with actual clients). All participants increased their accuracy in implementing FAs during the remote BST phase. During post-training probes with a simulated client and in situ probes with actual clients, eight of the ten participants maintained their performance at or above mastery criterion. Two of the ten participants needed additional coaching and training. These results suggest that the use of remote technology for training purposes could be a cost-effective and feasible solution to increase the quality of services and number of trained professionals in underserved areas.
Cultural Studies	"Obituaries were the first public acknowledgement that renowned jazz singer Chris Connor (1927-2009) had been a lesbian. This article investigates the significance of this posthumous revelation, positioning Connor as a point of entry to a queered useable past, and argues that a combination of factors in her biography and performance style offers audiences a unique way of reading and interpreting performativity and celebrity in relation to queer lives. Drawing on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick""s theorisation of the closet as a framework for enabling or contravening ways of knowing, I analyse coolness, both as a singing style and as a mode of social performance, as a form of closetedness that enabled Connor""s successful career, but required equivocation and diminished agency. I contend that coolness/closetedness as modelled by Connor was a negotiation between convention and subversion, with historical evidence indicating that she had special significance for queer audiences of the past. Moreover, I argue that she continues to have importance for queer listeners, not only for her music, but precisely because her relative obscurity and the lack of details in her biography offer an open-endedness that make her a more adaptable ""stand-in"" for understanding the lives of queer forebears forgotten by history."
Cultural Studies	The focus of this article is a critical look at the epistemological treatment of the Haitian Revolution by progressive 20th-century scholars such as C. L. R. James, Eugene Genovese, Robin Blackburn, David Geggus and Susan Buck-Morss. Their ideas and modes of thinking, knowing and constructing meaning, in respect of the cognitive and general epistemological basis of the Haitian Revolution, are examined in comparison to 19th-century black abolitionist thinkers such as Pompee Valentin Vastey, Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown and James Theodore Holly. The essay concludes that the 20th-century progressive Haitian revolutionary scholars have too uncritically relied on the 18th and 19th-century occidental ontological and epistemological complex to construct narratives of the Haitian Revolution. By doing so, they denied or underestimated the cognitive agency of Africans in the making of the Haitian Revolution and thus presented a distorted picture of the Haitian Revolution in Haitian revolution studies.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate whether religious practice can modify quality of life (QoL) in BC patients during chemotherapy. QoL and religion practice questionnaire (RPQ) scores were evaluated in a sample of BC patients in different moments. Before chemotherapy initiation, women with lower physical and social functional scores displayed higher RPQ scores. On the other hand, low RPQ patients worsened some QoL scores over time. Body image acceptance was positively correlated with religious practice and specifically praying activity. This preliminary study suggests the importance of religion in coping with cancer chemotherapy.
Management	Although institutional theorists maintain that the widespread diffusion of ISO 9000 is the result of institutional forces, they have neglected the potential gains to top management in the perpetuation of the standard. Based on a long-horizon event study with control firms to detect long-term abnormal financial gains, we investigate the impact of ISO 9000 adoption on CEO compensation in the U. S. manufacturing industry from 1994 to 2006. We find that the CEOs' total cash compensation was positively adjusted when their firms received ISO 9000 certification, and they received higher-value stock options when their firms embarked on ISO 9000 certification. However, the performance of the ISO 9000 certified firms was not improved throughout this period. Our further analyses suggest that it is likely that the CEO influences the board to obtain higher compensation under an institutionalized environment. Contrary to the traditional institutional theory-based view, we argue that a highly institutionalized environment does provide political opportunities for organizational actors to garner personal advantages.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To describe the provision of medical care in assisted living (AL) as provided by physicians who are especially active in providing care to older adults and AL residents; to identify characteristics associated with physician confidence in AL staff; and to ask physicians a variety of questions about their experience providing care to AL residents and how it compares with providing care in the nursing home and home care settings. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: AL communities in 27 states. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-five physicians and administrators of 125 AL settings in which they had patients. MEASUREMENTS: Interviews and questionnaires containing open-and close-ended questions regarding demographics, care arrangements, attitudes, and behaviors in managing medical problems. RESULTS: Most respondents were certified in internal medicine (46%) or family medicine (47%); 32% were certified in geriatrics and 30% in medical directorship. In this select sample, 48% visited the AL setting once a year or less, and 19% visited once a week or more. Mean physician confidence in AL staff was 3.3 (somewhat confident), with greater confidence associated with smaller AL community size, nursing presence, and the physician being the medical director. Qualitative analyses identified differences between settings including lack of vital sign assessment in the home setting, concern about the ability of AL staff to assess and monitor problems, and greater administrative and regulatory requirements in AL than in the other settings. CONCLUSION: Providing medical care for AL residents presents unique challenges and opportunities for physicians. Nursing presence and physician oversight and familiarity and communicating with AL staff who are highly familiar with a given resident and can monitor care may facilitate care.

Geography	The primary objective of this paper is to present the characteristics of laser scanning technology in the documentation of cultural and historical heritage objects of complex shapes. Generally speaking, the digital recording of monuments is a complex process that depends highly on the nature of subject as well as on applied surveying methods and processing. The paper describes the geometric documentation of the monument 'Wounded Lion', which begins with the collection of data, followed with processing, and concludes with the presentation of the final results. At present, 3D models are frequently used for the dissemination of information about cultural and historical heritage objects, e.g., via web pages in the form of VRML, models. However, the creation, publication, and interaction of high-resolution 3D textured models remain rather challenging and difficult tasks. Such models, with a certain level of accuracy, are clearly invaluable tools for applications involving the restoration, maintenance, and monitoring of monuments. The goal of this paper is to explore the process of creating detailed and accurate (to the greatest degree possible) 3D models.
Education & Educational Research	Evaluation of educational systems is a reality in nearly every advanced country. In this framework, a number of different evaluation models have appeared. However, these models have already become partially or completely obsolete. This paper presents a model of systemic evaluation for basic education at the regional government level. It begins with a few introductory aspects that place the framework for the idea behind the model, its intentions, and several important characteristics. This is followed by the development of the proposal, detailing each one of its components. Next, a synthesis of the model is offered. The paper then concludes with a section on recommendations.
Gerontology	Aggressive behavior between residents with dementia in long-term care residences is a concerning but understudied phenomenon. The goal of the study was to identify the circumstances, sequence of events, and triggers that lead to these behaviors. I collected the data during 10 months in two special care units of an assisted living residence. I used participant observation as the primary data collection strategy, complemented by review of clinical records and semi-structured interviews with care staff and managers. As the analytic framework, I used Grounded Theory informed by Miles and Huberman's approach. In a substantial number of the reported 85 incidents, I identified observable early warning signs; in the majority, I identified observable causes or triggers prior to the aggressive acts. The majority of incidents were situational-reactive (circumstance-driven) and therefore potentially modifiable. Twelve effective staff prevention strategies were identified. I suggest incorporating the study findings into care staff training programs.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This study describes the experiences of nurses and allied health professionals as first-time knowledge brokers, attempting to bridge the research-practice gap within health care. A qualitative study using in-depth interviews and documentary analysis was conducted.The data was analysed using a thematic analysis strategy. Participants were 17 knowledge brokers and five individuals mentoring and supporting them. Four themes described their experiences: expectations, pragmatics, emotional reactions and outcomes. In summary, knowledge brokering roles had multi-level benefits. However, there is a lack of support and recognition for these roles at an organisational level, making these activities difficult to sustain in the long term.
Law	"Sustainability is receiving increasing attention from issuers, investors, and regulators. The desire to understand issuer sustainability practices and their relationship to economic performance has resulted in a proliferation of sustainability disclosure regimes and standards. The range of approaches to disclosure, however. limits the comparability and reliability of the information disclosed. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s longstanding policy that sustainability is not properly part of financial disclosure has contributed to the current regime. Although the SEC has solicited comment on whether to reverse this policy and require expanded sustainability disclosures in issuers' periodic financial reporting, and investors have communicated broad-based support for such expanded disclosures, the SEC to date still has not required general sustainability disclosure. This Article argues that claims about the relationship between issuer sustainability practices and risk management, business plans, and economic vulnerability warrant incorporating sustainability information into SEC-mandated financial reporting. Perhaps even more important. in light of the growing pressure for issuers to adopt sustainable business practices and the responsiveness of many issuers to this pressure, is the need for issuers, investors, and regulators to obtain the information necessary to evaluate claims about the economic impact of sustainability initiatives. Drawing upon the existing narrative disclosure frameworks in SEC-mandated reporting requirements, this Article offers an innovative proposal for sustainability disclosure-a sustainability discussion and analysis, or ""SD&A,"" section of the annual report. This Article identifies the critical components necessary to make mandated sustainability disclosure both practical and cost-effective and offers a workable first step for integrating sustainability disclosure into issuer financial reporting."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Site planning for parks consists of synthetic strategies to improve visitors' experience and appreciation of park features. An important aspect in site planning is to coordinate visitor flows in order to avoid excessive congestion that may depreciate visiting experience. An emerging need in the coordination strategies is to personalize visiting routes and enhance the enjoyment of the tour for individual visitors. On the individual level, visitors have diverse preferences for park attractions. Scheduling a tour to visit attractions is restricted by not only the layout of park facilities but also the uncertainty of waiting induced by different lengths of lines at attractions. This paper proposes a tentative solution to optimize the logistics of individual tours by considering the dynamic nature of waiting time at park attractions derived from empirical data. The optimal solution is achieved using the branch-and-bound algorithm and is implemented in a real-world case of Beijing Zoo, a metropolitan zoology park in Beijing, China. The case study provides corroborating evidence for studying the logistical routing of park tours that: (1) visitors arriving at the park earlier can avoid crowds and excessive lines whereas visiting at midday would encounter excessive waiting and (2) the shortest tour route may not necessarily be the most efficient; strategically scheduling the visit to popular exhibits in their off-peak hours could effectively shorten overall tour time. This problem, called the Traveling Salesman Problem with Waiting Times (TSPWT) increases the realism of the routing problem while shedding new light on personalized routing strategies for improving individual touring experience.
Urban Studies	A sense of safety and security is of the utmost importance for most residents because it contributes to personal and collective well-being. However, that sense of safety may rest upon community structural factors such as inequality and intracommunity factors such as social capital and civic engagement. In fact, these factors may mediate the relationship between inequality and residents' sense of safety. As such, the purpose of this study is to investigate this processthe extent to which social capital and civic engagement partially mediate the relationship between economic inequality and sense of safety across 26U.S. metro areas. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we found that social capital fully mediates the relationship between inequality and sense of safety but that civic engagement does not. Specifically, residents in communities characterized by high levels of inequality also report reduced levels of social capital, which then results in a lower sense of safety. Additionally, residents who report lower civic engagement report that their communities are less safe.
Ethnic Studies	Danish society used to have a very homogenous culture; everybody was Lutheran and there were only very small groups of ethnic minorities. However, since the 1960s the immigration of foreign workers and refugees has created substantial minority groups of people who are very different ethnically, religiously and linguistically. Becoming a multicultural country may be particularly problematic for such a formerly homogeneous society; formal and informal rules for the co-existence of different ethnic and religious segments of the society have until now not been necessary.
Urban Studies	Most scholars in urban studies and public policy/administration support city living, that is, they suggest that people are happy in cities or at least they focus on how to make people happy in cities. Planners also largely focus on making cities happy places. Economists emphasize agglomeration economies. Urbanism is popular and fashionable. The goal of this study is to challenge this common wisdom and stimulate discussion. Fuse the General Social Survey to calculate subjective wellbeing or happiness by size of a place to find out when a place is too big. Malaise or unhappiness increases with size of a place (with a bump around 10k people) and reaches a significant level when population exceeds several hundred thousand. Results are robust to the operationalization of an urban area, and to the elaboration of the model with multiple controls known to predict happiness. This study concerns only the US, and results should not be generalized to other countries or historical contexts. Directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cultural Studies	"Multiple, intersecting commentaries, songs, texts and images attest to eighteenth-, nineteenth- and twentieth-century perceptions of the emotionally charged and stimulative character of street crying's sonic signaling in cities such as Paris, Barcelona and Madrid. Crying by female hawkers of goods such as fruit, lottery tickets or flowers was freighted with implications intensifying its particular emotional force for listeners. In tonadillas and sainetes, melodias and canciones, and early twentieth-century song sheets and recordings, interpretations of flower sellers in particular harnessed the affective implications of their presences in public spaces to the social implications of direct physical approach. The tonalities and rhythms of many pregones incited nineteenth- and early twentieth-century listeners to intellectual and emotional cognition around sadness, melancholy and suffering. Beyond the materiality of the acoustic connection between crier and hearer, flower (and other street) sellers' work in urban spaces sounded out rhetorical strategies of debasement, humility and pleading in close physical proximity to potential buyers. An examination of Raquel Meller's recordings of ""La billetera"" (1917) and ""La violetera"" (1921) in the context of publicity promotions reveals what viewers and listeners knew collectively and cross-generationally: that suffering, humility and poverty were inextricable from aural paradigms for women's street crying."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The present study was an attempt to understand sport volunteers' commitment to an organization from a developmental perspective and propose a hierarchical model of volunteer commitment based on Kohlberg's moral development model. The proposed model includes five stages of attitudinal commitment which are developmental and distinct in nature with the following hierarchical sequence: primitive commitment, continuance commitment, external commitment, normative commitment, and affective commitment. By comparing Kohlberg's moral development model with the three components of Allen and Meyer's organizational commitment, we contend that the external commitment and the primitive commitment need to be included to view sport volunteers' commitment from the developmental perspective. Along with these two new commitment concepts, the characteristics and theoretical reasoning related to each stage of sport volunteers' organizational commitment were addressed.
Criminology & Penology	On March 1, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the execution of offenders under the age of 18 at the time of their criminal offense was unconstitutional. Although many welcomed this decision, some individuals still remain concerned that the elimination of the specter of capital punishment will inevitably increase homicidal behavior among juveniles by reducing the prospect of deterrence. Using monthly data from the Supplemental Homicide Reports and a multiple time-series research design, the authors investigate the impact of the Roper v. Simmons decision on homicides perpetrated by juveniles in the 20 states affected by the law. Maximum likelihood results reveal that the repeal of the juvenile death penalty has had no effect on juvenile homicidal behavior.
Management	We forecast how HRM practice and HR research on fairness in the workplace will need to change in light of several specific global workplace trends, namely, increases in workplace diversity and globalization, technology mediated relationships, individualized psychological contracts, and service-related jobs. After describing these trends, we illustrate how the meaning of fairness and worker expectations regarding fairness may be changing in response. We further discuss how those changes will impact HR management (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Ethnic Studies	This article examines the gap in meaning systems between the dominant mainstream understanding in North America of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the meaning given to it within different Pakistani communities in Canada and in Pakistan. It describes the emergence of 9/11 conspiracy theory discourses in three different studies involving Pakistani immigrants in Montreal and Pakistanis in Karachi, carried out at three different points in time over the last five years. The polarization of meaning in the war on terror between the host society and Muslim immigrant communities in North America is associated with the emergence of feelings of fear and threat in all communities. The results also suggest that views of local and global power relations play a role in shaping these conspiracy theory discourses.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Nowadays, the Internet has penetrated into every aspect of our daily life. The aims of this study were (a) to examine the patterns of Internet use among Hong Kong early adolescents and (b) to explore whether such patterns differed in terms of the psychological well-being (happiness, loneliness, depression and hopelessness), sensation seeking and perceived social support. A total of 1401 Chinese adolescents participated in the study. Results from the latent profile analysis suggested that there were four latent profiles, and different patterns of the Internet use were associated with the psychological well-being, perceived social support and sensation seeking. The present study sheds light on the importance of considering the nature of online activity and the relationship between Internet use and psychosocial well-being. Implications of the study are discussed.
Rehabilitation	School districts have struggled with special education teacher shortages for over a decade. Special education teachers who leave the profession after a few years certainly contribute to the shortage. Project ReSpecT (Retaining Special Education Teachers) was a federally funded project to develop and implement a mentoring model designed to retain 1st-year special education teachers. The purpose of this article is to describe the first two phases of Project ReSpecT, including the research that led to the development of the model and the pilot test phase. We also discuss the preliminary findings from this study in the context of results from similar programs. We end by discussing implications for educational policy and practice for mentoring models.
Management	ISO 9001 certification motivations can be classified into two main categories: (1) internal motivations; and (2) external motivations. Internal motivations are related with genuine organisational improvement goals (productivity, internal communication, process performance), while external motivations are mainly related to promotional and marketing issues (customer and market pressures, market share). Some companies that become certified mostly upon the basis of external motivations define their main goal as 'obtaining registration', and thus typically adopt a limited view over the scope of quality management systems implementation and certification. Based upon a detailed review of 100 ISO 9001 audit reports, we performed a detailed statistical comparison between both types of motivations driving companies in their certification efforts, explored their differences and similarities and derived a statistically based classification model that was able to predict, for a particular organisation, what kind of predominant motivation lead to its certification, from information that can be retrieved from the contents of the corresponding ISO 9001 audit reports.
Gerontology	Using an interdisciplinary model of financial planning, we investigated the factors contributing to perceived adequacy of retirement savings among Hong Kong workers by replicating a previous study of American and Dutch workers. The model was also tested for age differences in the way in which the variables operated within the model. These questions were examined using data from a phone survey conducted with 999 Hong Kong workers in 2012 We examined three psychological factors (future time orientation, goal clarity and financial knowledge), three social support variables (early learning from parents, spousal support and friend support) and three institutional factors (quality of employer pensions, trust in banks and fund managers, and trust in the government), as well as retirement savings planning activity and perceived retirement savings adequacy. Path analyses were used to test the model for the whole sample and separately for younger (N=437) and older (N=562) workers. Although a few age differences were found in the path analyses, the model was found to be useful in explaining the factors contributing to retirement savings planning and practices. Finally, we discuss how our findings differ from those of prior studies, and we assess their theoretical and practical implications.
History Of Social Sciences	Although the Plan for Barrio Sur (1956) proposed by Antonio Bonet Castellana for the city of Buenos Aires was not executed, this paper suggests that it offers pertinent insights for studies of the modern city. The plan defended housing as an important programme in the city centre, regarded as being primarily for working and leisure, and proposed a city of multiple functions. Bonet Castellana argued for high-density cities. He reviewed and reshaped the conventional planning approach (based on the traditional Spanish grid) with reference to three building types - the tower, the greca, and the low-rise. The low-rise type was particularly significant for him as he used it to determine the amount of green area dedicated to open-space and a formal pedestrian route. The combination of the three building types resulted in a new urban pattern in which open space figured significantly and in a way that was contrary to the common understanding of its role in the modern city.
Information Science & Library Science	Adopting Dimmick's niche theory as its theoretical framework, this study used gratifications obtained and gratification opportunities to examine the competitive relationships among three television media OTT, IPTV (MOD), and digital cable. Two research methods were employed, the first of which was to conduct 20 intensive interviews. The second method was to adopt a nationwide telephone survey that resulted in 1015 valid questionnaires. The data analysis yielded three conclusions. (1) Among the three media, OTT was the most competitive, while digital cable and MOD were almost equivalent in terms of their competitiveness. (2) The highest competition occurred between MOD and digital cable because the respondents perceived the two media to resemble one another more than OTT. (3) This study found OTT to be a generalist, while MOD and digital cable were specialists. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
History	"When the Portuguese arrived in Japan around 1543, it was the first time in the history of the archipelago that Western foreigners had entered the country and settled there. These ""barbarians from the south"" (namban-jin) were considered strangers and viewed with curiosity and suspicion. In Tokugawa Japan (c. 1615-1868), politically marked by territorial unification and the centralization of power, the image of the Europeans that was created and visually registered on folding screens and lacquer-ware was used as a model to frame this presence by both the Japanese political and economic elites and those considered marginal to the existing social order. Namban art, especially paintings, can be seen as a visual display of Japan's self-knowledge and its knowledge of distant ""neighbours."""
Environmental Studies	Rural land rental markets in China play an increasingly important role in the transformation of the agricultural sector. This study focuses on the rural land rental market in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Southern China, a mountainous region, where rapid changes in land use have taken place with the transition from traditional agriculture and a tropical rainforest to rubber monoculture. Notably, we assess the impacts of population aging, land tenure security, and ethnicity on the participation of smallholders in the land rental market. The analysis suggests that a higher proportion of older people hi a household increases the likelihood of renting out land and reduces the probability of renting in land, implying that population aging fosters land rental market development by transferring land from older to younger farmers. We also confirm that the availability of a land tenure certificate has a significant and positive impact on the renting out of land. Furthermore, ethnic minority groups are less likely to rent out land, indicating that land rental markets are ethnic sensitive. Additionally, specialization in rubber farming, household wealth and the altitude of household location also influence participation in the land rental market.
Cultural Studies	In information and media affluent societies, the critical ability of citizens is increasingly important. This is reflected in a number of political initiatives that aim at engaging citizens in questions of media content and production, often labelled as media literacy. In this context, skills related to media technologies that are often accentuated in media literacy education are a necessary but not sufficient condition for media literacy. Critical reflexivity and critical practices are crucial for media literacy and therefore in the centre of this article. This article proposes an analysis of media criticism from a citizens' perspective. Drawing on solicited, open-ended online diaries as well as in-depth interviews with young Estonian citizens, the article applies an inductive approach to media criticism while paying attention to the specific context in which the media criticism arises.
Geography	This paper challenges the use of a geographically site-centred, flat ontology to justify contemporary anarchists' predisposition to espouse exclusively prefigurative forms of action. By considering the anarchist, post-capitalist potential of a technologically enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) economy and Collaborative Commons movement, the case is made for the need to acknowledge and engage the higher-order (emergent) nexuses between state apparatuses and capitalist flows. Doing so, it is argued, makes envisioning the process of creating anarchist oriented, post-capitalist futures significantly more tangible and convincing.
Health Policy & Services	The Trump administration proposed liberalizing rules governing non-ACA-compliant, short-term coverage; responding to state guidance, Blue Cross of Idaho filed health plans not meeting ACA requirements.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: Gait asymmetry is a common consequence of stroke and improving gait symmetry is an important goal of rehabilitation. We investigated the effect of a single textured insole in improving gait symmetry in individuals with stroke. Method: Seventeen individuals with stroke who had asymmetrical gait were recruited and required to walk with a textured insole positioned in the shoe on the unaffected side or without the insole. Gait parameters were evaluated using the instrumented walkway. Gait velocity, cadence, and symmetry indices for the spatial and temporal parameters of gait and center of pressure displacements were obtained. Results: When walking with a textured insole, symmetry indexes for stance, single support phases of gait, as well as center of pressure displacements improved significantly. While using a textured insole, the duration of the stance phase and a single support phase decreased on the unaffected side and increased on the affected side significantly. Gait velocity and cadence were not affected by the use of the insole. Conclusions: Individuals with stroke walking with a textured insole placed in the shoe on the unaffected side improved the symmetry of their gait. The outcome provides a foundation for future investigations of the efficacy of using a single textured insole in gait rehabilitation of individuals with unilateral impairment.
Transportation	Ocean container carriers have implemented slow steaming (reduced vessel speeds) in recent years to improve fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However, many shippers oppose the practice due to increased pipeline inventory associated with longer transit times. Given this conflict, this article seeks to quantify the costs and benefits of slow steaming relative to carriers and shippers. We simulate a high volume Asia-North America container trade lane to estimate slow steaming impacts under different vessel speeds, volumes and fuel prices. Under current conditions, the results justify slow steaming practices, revealing extra slow steaming as the most beneficial vessel speed with a 20 per cent reduction in total costs and a 43 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Extra slow steaming is also optimal for future volumes and a wide range of fuel prices. Furthermore, the results detail carrier and shipper cost trade-offs, thus offering practical evidence and transparency to the industry on how to create financial equity in facilitating contractual-based agreements for vessel speed standards.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This paper identifies what customers experience as hospitality and subsequently presents a novel and compact assessment scale for measuring customers' experience of hospitality at any kind of service organization. The Experience of Hospitality Scale (EH-Scale) takes a broader perspective compared to existing scales, which predominantly measure hospitable behavior of service employees and are specifically developed for organizations in the hospitality industry. A thorough approach containing two qualitative and two quantitative studies resulted in the thirteen-item EH-Scale. The scale measures three experiential factors of hospitality: the experience of inviting (open, inviting, freedom), the experience of care (servitude, empathy and acknowledgement), and the experience of comfort (feeling at ease, relaxed and comfortable).

Law	This Article addresses the fundamental question of whether, as a matter of good policy, it is ever appropriate that a foreign issuer be subject to the US. fraud-on-the-market private damages class action liability regime, and, if so, by what kinds of claimants and under what circumstances. The bulk of payouts under the US. securities laws arise out of fraud-on-the-market class actions-actions against issuers on behalf of secondary market purchasers of their shares for trading losses suffered as a result of issuer misstatements in violation of Rule 10b-5. In the first decade of this century, foreign issuers became frequent targets of such actions, with some of these suits yielding among the very largest payouts in securities law history. The law determining the reach of the US. fraud-on-the-market liability regime against foreign issuers has since been thrown into flux. The Supreme Court's recent decision in the Morrison case adopted an entirely new approach for determining the reach of Rule 10b-5 in situations with transnational features. This new approach focused on whether the purchase was of a security listed on a US. exchange or occurred in the United States, in contrast to the previous focus on whether either conduct or effects of sufficient importance occurred in the United States. In almost immediate response, Congress, in the Dodd-Frank Act, reversed the Court's decision with respect to actions by the government and mandated that the SEC prepare a report concerning the desirability of doing the same with respect to private damages actions. This Article goes back to first principles to look at the basic policy concerns that are implicated by the reach of fraud-on-the-market class actions for damages, and to determine who, under a variety of circumstances relating to the nationality of the purchasers, the place of the trade, and the place of the issuer's misconduct, is ultimately affected by imposition of this liability regime on foreign issuers. The resulting analysis suggests a simple, clear rule likely to both maximize US. economic welfare and, by also promoting global economic welfare, foster good foreign relations. The US. fraud-on-the-market class action liability regime should not as a general matter be imposed upon any genuinely foreign issuer, even where the claimant is a US. investor purchasing shares in a US. market or where the issuer engages in significant conduct in the United States relating to the misstatement. The only exception would be a foreign issuer that has agreed, as a form of bonding, to be subject to the US. regime. This Article then charts a practical path to reform based on this simple rule. It assesses the attractions of and problems with, the two competing alternatives-using the Morrison rule and returning to the conduct/effects test-and explores the possibilities for reform through the courts, SEC rulemaking, and legislation.
Social Work	Studies exam ming the relationship between globalisation and the welfare state tend to focus oil the effects of economic dimensions of globalisation, the extent to which a Country is part of the world market. Globalisation also has social and political dimensions and the effects of these on welfare states - in terms of social security transfers and generosity - are studied in this article. Data from the KOF Index of Globalisation, the OECD Historical Statistics and the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset are used to analyse the effects of social and political openness oil the welfare states of 18 countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development between 1970 and 2000. The analyses show that social security transfers and generosity have increased less in countries with the highest increase in social openness and that the welfare state is not affected by political openness.
Information Science & Library Science	Background Health information technology (HIT) certification and meaningful use are interventions encouraging the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in the USA. However, these initiatives also constitute a significant intervention which will change the structure of the EHR market. Objective To describe quantitatively recent changes to both the demand and supply sides of the EHR market. Materials and methods A cohort of 3447 of hospitals from the HIMSS Analytics Database (2006-10) was created. Using hospital referral regions to define the local market, we determined the percentage of hospitals using paper records, the number of vendors, and local EHR vendor competition using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Changes over time were assessed using a series of regression equations and geographic information systems analyses. Results Overall, there was movement away from paper records, upward trends in the number of EHR vendors, and greater competition. However, changes differed according to hospital size and region of the country. Changes were greatest for small hospitals, whereas competition and the number of vendors did not change dramatically for large hospitals. Discussion The EHR market is changing most dramatically for those least equipped to handle broad technological transformation, which underscores the need for continued targeted support. Furthermore, wide variations across the nation indicate a continued role for states in the support of EHR utilization. Conclusion The structure of the EHR market is undergoing substantial changes as desired by the proponents and architects of HIT certification and meaningful use. However, these transformations are not uniform for all hospitals or all the country.
Economics	This paper investigates the interplay between monetary aggregates and the dynamics and variability of output and prices by considering both the money supplied by commercial banks as credit to firms and the fiat money created by the central bank through the quantitative easing monetary policy. The authors address this problem by means of an agent-based model and simulator, called Eurace, which is characterized by a complete set of interrelated markets and different types of interacting agents, modeled according to a rigorous balance-sheet approach. The dynamics of credit money is endogenous and depends on the supply of credit from the banking system, which is constrained by its equity base, and the demand of credit from firms in order to finance their production activity. Alternative dynamic paths for credit money have been produced by setting different firms' dividend policies. Results point out the strict dependence of output and prices dynamics on monetary aggregates, and show the emergence of endogenous business cycles which are mainly due to the interplay between the real economic activity and its financing through the credit market. In particular, the amplitude of the business cycles strongly rises when the fraction of earnings paid out by firms as dividends is higher, that is when firms are more constrained to borrow credit money to fund their activity. This interesting evidence can be explained by the fact that the level of firms leverage, defined as the debt-equity ratio, can be considered ad a proxy of the likelihood of bankruptcy, an event which causes mass layoffs and supply decrease.
Cultural Studies	This article describes the relationship between family photography, oral history, and feeling. The authors explore questions about affect and family photography in relationship to black, queer relationality and to Asian, diasporic subjectivities. They argue that the affective modality of family photography for marginalized subjects is that of mixed feelings', which they analyze through a focus on aspiration' as central to the visual and affective discourses of family photography, oral history, and diaspora. Working with recent work by Christina Sharpe and Tina Campt, the authors describe aspiration within family photography as indexing both the normative temporalities of capitalist futurity and, at the same time, a utopian technology of black futurity that enables the making of necessary futures outside of white supremacy and heteronormativity. The research is part of a larger photography and oral history project, The Family Camera Network, which the article describes.
Political Science	This article considers how partisanship conditions attitudes toward corruption. Stirred by the puzzle of why corruption does not seem to have the electoral consequences we would expect, it explores whether party supporters are more tolerant toward corruption cases when they affect their own party. The partisan-bias hypothesis is confirmed by a survey experiment carried out in Spain, a country where a number of corruption scandals have been recently visible. The results show that the same offense is judged differently depending on whether the responsible politician is a member of the respondent's party, of unknown partisan affiliation, or of a rival party. Furthermore, the degree of partisan bias depends on political sophistication. This suggests that although partisanship may induce tolerance to same-party corruption practices, the partisan bias disappears when political awareness is high.
Urban Studies	The relationship between per capita municipal spending on basic urban services and urban population density is not a linear one. The optimal density level that minimizes spending in urban services is close to 9,000 inhabitants per square kilometer. In Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico, 85% of the municipalities find themselves below the ideal density level. The findings of this article suggest that policies that promote urbanization and densification of intermediate cities can have significant benefits in reducing municipal expenditures.
History	Traditionally, scholars have depicted the early Ottonian kingdom, ruled by Henry 1(919-936) as being deficient in royal administrative structures, particularly those that depended on the use of documents. Instead, Henry is supposed to have ruled his kingdom through a wide range of rituals associated with sacral kingship. However, it long has been recognized that both ecclesiastical and royal estates in the eastern portions of the Carolingian empire, which developed into the early German kingdom, were organized in a manner consistent with the dictates of the famous capitulary de villis. Recent scholarship has made it clear that this capitulary required the production of large numbers of documents, which were crucial both for the administration of individual estates and for the use of these estates by the king. This essay draws out the numerous ways in which Henry land his officials used the 'written word' to administer the king's estates, and shows an important element of royal administration that demonstrates enormous continuities with the adminstrative structures that were in place in the Carolingian Empire.
Gerontology	Transitional care is an important part of geriatric medicine that has not traditionally been taught to residents through formal curricula. This article reviews two online curricula available through the Portal of Geriatric Online Education. The two products reviewed here, appropriate for resident training, focus on care transitions from hospital to other care settings.
Education & Educational Research	This article explores the progress of previously reluctant pupil writers through mediated and collaborative activity and the role of the Vygotskian teacher in the teaching of writing. Classroom writing is viewed primarily as social and cultural practice whereby development through interaction and dialogue with others precedes individual development. By defining Vygotskys theoretical concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) as a shared zone of activity between teacher and pupils a framework for analysis is developed for collaborative classroom writing. The role of dialogical activity within ZPDs is also considered through an analysis of critical incidents of classroom activity.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The current article is the first in a series of review articles addressing biosemiotic terminology. The biosemiotic glossary project is inclusive and designed to integrate views of a representative group of members within the biosemiotic community based on a standard survey and related publications. The methodology section describes the format of the survey conducted in November-December 2013 in preparation of the current review and targeted on the terms 'agent' and 'agency'. Next, I summarize denotation, synonyms and antonyms, with special emphasis on the denotation of these terms in current biosemiotic usage. The survey findings include ratings of nine citations defining or making use of the two terms. I provide a summary of respondents' own definitions and suggested term usage. Further sections address etymology, connotations, and related terms in English and other languages. A section on the notions' mainstream meaning vs. their meaning in biosemiotics is followed by attempt at synthesis and conclusions. Although there is currently no consensus in the biosemiotic community on what constitutes a semiotic agent, i.e., an agent in the context of semiosis (the action of signs), most respondents agree that core attributes of an agent include goal-directedness, self-governed activity, processing of semiosis and choice of action, with these features being vital for the functioning of the living system in question. I agree that these four features are constitutive of biosemiotic agents, and stipulate that biosemiotic agents fall within three major categories, namely 1) sub-organismic biosemiotic agents, 2) organismic biosemiotic agents and 3) super-organismic biosemiotic agents.
Transportation	Current global production patterns have led to the emergence of systemic, chronic and structural trade imbalances between major trading regions. Increasing transportation led to a growth in the amount of full containers and subsequently to preceding and ensuing empty container movements. Empty container management is substantial to overcome the complex problem of empty container repositioning, storage and ownership conditions. Because of growing cost pressures and the continuous search for efficiency improvements, collaborative design approaches in the empty container management are becoming increasingly important. One approach is the joint use of containers by several container carriers and container leasing companies. Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a mathematical optimization approach, which optimizes container logistics networks and quantifies potential savings considering the establishment and operation of container pooling. It will be shown that positive economic effects can be generated by the implementation of container pooling, compared with non-cooperative behavior of container owners and leasing companies. In addition, port operators will be able to handle rising container volumes without major capacity adjustments. Further studies need to focus on practical implications of container pooling models and empirical evidence of the mathematical approach.
Linguistics	Ternary or three-level vowel length is typologically rare, and supporting evidence is limited. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the hypothesised case of this configuration in Shilluk. We first describe the role of vowel length in Shilluk phonology and morphology, and then report on an acoustic study in which minimal sets for vowel length (short, long, overlong) are measured for vowel duration, coda duration, vowel quality and fundamental frequency. Short, long and overlong vowels differ significantly and substantially in terms of vowel duration: 96% of the items can be classified successfully for vowel length on the basis of this measurement alone. Of the other measurements, only vowel quality is significant, and this effect is considerably smaller. The mean values for vowel duration - 68, 111 and 150 ms for short, long and overlong vowels respectively - are similar to those reported for ternary vowel length in Dinka.
Management	Research has established the relevance of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to firm performance but skepticism remains because of the ambiguity surrounding how EO might improve firm performance. We examine the key concepts of absorptive capacity and improvisation as two alternative learning modes serving as intermediate steps between EO and firm performance. Locating our study within manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, we find that absorptive capacity enhances the EO-performance relationship, both as a moderator and a mediator. In contrast to expectations, however, improvisation showed no such effects but conferred its own separate benefits instead. We further discuss the different effects of these learning modes on high performance and low performance groups.
Industrial Relations & Labor	This article examines the dispute resolution practices of Fair Work Australia that are evolving to deal with individual workplace rights, as its traditional role shifts away from conciliating and arbitrating collective industrial disputes. The workplace rights enshrined in the 'general protections' provisions in Part 3-1 of the Fair Work Act 2009 protect employees and prospective employees from any 'adverse action' taken against them because they are exercising a workplace right, or because they fall within one of the protected categories, such as the right to be free from discrimination. A broad range of alternative dispute resolution processes is now available to Fair Work Australia in dealing with such disputes. Alternative dispute resolution processes are seen as a way of avoiding costly and time-consuming litigation, and in some circumstances can improve access to justice for individuals. This article explores whether Fair Work Australia is likely to adopt different dispute resolution approaches from its traditional conciliation practices when managing 'general protections' applications, and whether the framework for dealing with these disputes will facilitate fair recognition and enforcement of workplace rights.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"We study the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model of financial market crashes (Johansen et al. in Int J The or Appl Financ 3(2): 219-255, 2000). On our view, the JLS model is a curious case from the perspective of the recent philosophy of science literature, as it is naturally construed as a ""minimal model"" in the sense of Batterman and Rice (Philos Sci 81(3): 349-376, 2014) that nonetheless provides a causal explanation of market crashes, in the sense of Woodward's interventionist account of causation (Woodward in Making things happen: a theory of causal explanation. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2003)."
Information Science & Library Science	Objective: We describe a stratified sampling design that combines electronic health records (EHRs) and United States Census (USC) data to construct the sampling frame and an algorithm to enrich the sample with individuals belonging to rarer strata. Materials and Methods: This design was developed for a multi-site survey that sought to examine patient concerns about and barriers to participating in research studies, especially among under-studied populations (eg, minorities, low educational attainment). We defined sampling strata by cross-tabulating several sociodemographic variables obtained from EHR and augmented with census-block-level USC data. We oversampled rarer and historically underrepresented subpopulations. Results: The sampling strategy, which included USC-supplemented EHR data, led to a far more diverse sample than would have been expected under random sampling (eg, 3-, 8-, 7-, and 12-fold increase in African Americans, Asians, Hispanics and those with less than a high school degree, respectively). We observed that our EHR data tended to misclassify minority races more often than majority races, and that non-majority races, Latino ethnicity, younger adult age, lower education, and urban/suburban living were each associated with lower response rates to the mailed surveys. Discussion: We observed substantial enrichment from rarer subpopulations. The magnitude of the enrichment depends on the accuracy of the variables that define the sampling strata and the overall response rate. Conclusion: EHR and USC data may be used to define sampling strata that in turn may be used to enrich the final study sample. This design may be of particular interest for studies of rarer and understudied populations.
Management	This paper draws on a risk analysis framework in order to develop a systematic understanding of the risks perceived by partners, and to investigate the implications of risk perception for the configuration of control, in the post-formation governance of international joint ventures. The key variables in this framework consist of six situational factors which are considered as potential antecedents of perceived risk: conflict, opportunism, cultural difference, dependence, partner fit, and ownership share; partner's perception of risk; and post-formation governance as a set of outcome variables. The framework is tested using a sample of international joint ventures located in Taiwan. The findings show that conflicts between partners, opportunistic behavior by the local partner, cultural differences, and perceived partner misfit are related to foreign partners' risk perceptions. This study suggests that when foreign partners face likely performance and partnership risks after an IJV is established, they tend to resort to tighter post-formation governance measures in order to increase or maintain their confidence in their joint ventures.

Sociology	"The Appalachian Trail is a more than 2,000-mile-long wilderness trail in the Eastern United States. Every year, aspiring long-distance hikers travel from across the US and abroad, intending to hike the entire length of the trail, which takes around 6 months to complete. Numerous species of wildlife dwell on and around the trail. The aim of this study was to explore how long-distance hikers perceived the nonhuman animals that they encountered on their trek, and how they described navigating these encounters. Due to a thriving online community of hikers who blogged about their experiences on the trail, it was possible to retrieve a substantial amount of rich data detailing first hand encounters between hikers and animals on the trail. It was found that just under a third of all hiker narratives mentioning wild animals on the trail indicated that the author had responded to the animal as being cute. Despite cuteness frequently being perceived as trivial or banal, this paper argues that a hiker""s perception of an animal as cute is more complex and meaningful to their overall experience of the animal than might initially be assumed. Both the aesthetic of cuteness and the effect of cuteness on an observer are considered in light of existing research on the subject. Some specific accounts of a hiker perceiving and responding to cuteness in animals on the trail are then explored, which leads on to a consideration of why so many animals on the trail might have been perceived as being cute. Finally, the paper discusses what being seen as cute meant for the animal involved, as hikers stared at, approached, followed, and frequently made attempts at touching or feeding animals that they found cute. The paper concludes that, far from being inconsequential, the perception of cuteness in an animal was meaningful for the human observer, as well as having consequences for the animal in question."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Michel FoucauLt's understanding of how knowledge/power, as supported by the knowledge apparatus, made possible the Medical Gaze that has been one of the primary foundations of our understanding of the medical experience for the past 45 years. However, as a result of the epidemiological shift that has occurred throughout the Western world, as well as the proliferation of medical information across electronic media, the medical experience and our corresponding understanding of it, must adapt. In that spirit, the present work provides a short review of Foucault's model of medical authority, and introduces an adaptation to the model that accounts for the role, and impact, of the informal caregiver of the care-dependent geriatric within the existing medical milieu.
Political Science	The research on foreign aid has long struggled to determine whether giving aid is a selfish or a selfless policy by donors. Instead of looking for evidence for one over the other, I propose examining under which circumstances aid is driven by selfish or selfless motives. A formal model allows for both motives to affect the donor leader's decision to grant foreign aid: it can buy a policy concession from the recipient, and it can also signal to the leader's domestic that the leader is humanitarian. Crucially, the model also predicts under which circumstances the selfish motives dictate the logic of foreign aid and when the selfless motives do. Using a mixtures-of-experts model, the statistical results support that a greater saliency for the recipient's policy choices leads to selfish aid and that greater domestic awareness of a poverty-stricken recipient leads to selfless aid.
History & Philosophy Of Science	I describe a problem about the relations among symmetries, laws and measurable quantities. I explain why several ways of trying to solve it will not work, and I sketch a solution that might work. I discuss this problem in the context of Newtonian theories, but it also arises for many other physical theories. The problem is that there are two ways of defining the space-time symmetries of a physical theory: as its dynamical symmetries or as its empirical symmetries. The two definitions are not equivalent, yet they pick out the same extension. This coincidence cries out for explanation, and it is not clear what the explanation could be.
Development Studies	Since 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively promoting its credentials for managing 'global health security'. However, the organisation's initial response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has attracted significant criticism, even prompting calls for its dissolution and the creation of a new global health agency. Drawing on principal-agent theory and insights from previous disease outbreaks, this article examines what went wrong, the extent to which the organisation can be held to account, and what this means for the WHO's global health security mandate.
Environmental Studies	"Changes in agriculture during the twentieth century led to high levels of food production based on increasing inputs and specialization of farms and agricultural regions. To address negative externalities of these changes, two forms of ecological modernization of agriculture are promoted: ""weak"" ecological modernization, mainly based on increasing input efficiency through crop and animal monitoring and nutrient recycling, and ""strong"" ecological modernization, based on increasing agrobiodiversity at different space and time scales and within or among farms to develop ecosystem services and in turn reduce industrial inputs even more. Because characterizing the sustainability of these two forms of ecological modernization remains an issue, we review the literature on livestock systems to compare their advantages and drawbacks. After defining the livestock system as a local social-ecological system embedded in a complex multi-level and multi-domain system, we characterize the two forms of ecological modernization (weak vs. strong). When sustainability is defined as a state that should be maintained at a certain level and assessed through a set of indicators (environmental, economic, and social), we highlight that one ecological modernization form might have an advantage for certain sustainability criteria, but a disadvantage for others. When sustainability is viewed as a process (resilience), we find that these two forms of ecological modernization are based on different properties: governance of the entire agri-food chain for weak ecological modernization versus local governance of agriculture and its biophysical and social diversity and connectivity, and management of slow variables for strong ecological modernization. The relevance of this sustainability-analysis approach is illustrated by considering different types of dairy livestock systems, organic agriculture and integrated crop-livestock systems."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Recent controversies about prisoner force-feeding have renewed debates on the ethical appropriateness of feeding individuals against their will. Critics condemn force-feeding as it seems to clash with prevailing bioethical principles of patient autonomy which grant patients the right to refuse medical treatment (or food) if they wish. This article uses contemporary history to highlight the complex development of policies on supported feeding in recent decades. It maintains that since the late-1970s, doctors and medical personnel have grappled with the problems posed by feeding numerous types of patients (not just hunger strikers) without express permission including the comatose, infants, anorexics and the elderly demented. Between the 1970s and 1990s, inconsistent approaches developed, which regularly negated the principles of patient autonomy. Many doctors and family members struggled emotionally with the prospect of letting an individual starve. Decisions made about whether or not to feed were informed by factors such as age, gender and perceptions of vulnerability. If patient autonomy is to guide decisions made to use, withdraw or withhold nutritional support, it would benefit from being consistently applied. Emotional detachment is essential to achieve this, although emotions, at the same time, present barriers to the implementation of ethical standards in clinical practice.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Many have suggested that young scientists are having a more difficult time getting research grants, citing the fact that the average age of recipients of prestigious grants is getting higher. We present a population model that suggests that the reason the average age of grant recipients is now higher is because the growth rate of science has slowed down in the last four decades.
International Relations	This paper traces the possibility of East Asian integration through comparison with the early stage of European integration on three different levels: ideas, national interests, and international circumstance. Judging from the European experience, ideas always come first, then national interest contests, and eventually the international circumstance conditions the context. I compare the multilateral approach in Europe with the imperial hegemony competition in East Asia, Adenauer's regionalization policy in Europe with the Yoshida line of Westernization detouring from Asia, and the US and Russia's different roles in the two regions as external forces constraining the international order. My conclusion for the future of East Asia is located somewhere between views of procedural divergence and fundamental skepticism. I worry about integration for the sake of integration in which regional integration is presupposed as inherently good. Such discourse will easily be deteriorated and such a blind community simply collapses when circumstances change. For these reasons, there needs to be an adequate discussion regarding for what, by whom, and through which method integration is achieved.
History	This article examines Thatcher's 1982 visit to China concerning Hong Kong's future. The visit occurred at the critical historical junctures of the rise of Thatcherism in post-Falklands Britain and of the growth of Deng Xiaoping's nationalist sensitivities. With her strong belief in capitalism, Thatcher aimed to convince Deng that Hong Kong's prosperity depended on confidence, which in turn rested on the continuation of British administration beyond 1997. With his nationalist feelings towards Taiwan stirred by America, Deng regarded Hong Kong's return to China as a non-negotiable principle. Thatcher's project of educating' Deng in capitalism was doomed to failure.
Area Studies	We examined existing problems relevant for education in global drylands and discuss their potential solutions in four fields, crucial for properly functioning educational systems: (a) response to low population densities, (b) governance, (c) language of instruction and (d) mismatch between education and the labour market. Our analysis leads us to the formulation of nine policy recommendations that may help create an educational system that strengthens resilience of dryland communities in the face of ongoing climate change. Our recommendations underline the necessity to combine systemic solutions with bottom-up ideas and extrinsic help coming from involvement of diaspora and non-governmental organizations.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	At the end of 2011, microbiologists created a scientific and media frenzy by genetically engineering mutant avian flu viruses that transmitted through the air between ferrets, the animal most widely used to model human flu. Though the studies offered new evidence of avian flu's pandemic potential, they were nevertheless restricted from publication because of concerns about their possible threat to human health and security. In this article, I examine the mutant flu controversy to show how nascent biosecurity regulations engender transformations in experimental systems; namely, in the use and interpretation of experimental organisms, and in the establishment of a culture of security among a globalizing community of scientists. Drawing on analyses of academic publications, interviews with microbiologists and biosecurity regulators, and ethnographic observations at a biosecure laboratory, I show how these experimental transformations are structured by the local demands of scientific production as well as by broader concerns about biosecurity made visible in formal and informal regulations on scientific conduct. I further argue that while the controversy signals unprecedented controls over publication in the biological sciences, such controls build upon and extend on-going shifts in scientific thought and practice in the wake of pandemic threats.
Economics	This paper examines how changes in major elements of the U.S. federal crop insurance program affect the structure of the agricultural insurance industry. We model interactions between farmers, insurance agents and insurance companies. Marginal changes in government policy (premium subsidy rate, A&O subsidy rate, and loading factor) affect the insurance premium rate, agent compensation rates, agent effort levels, and market demand for crop insurance. Farmers prefer a marginal increase in the premium subsidy rate, but the insurance companies' most preferred policy is a marginal increase in the A&O subsidy rate. We also evaluate the consequences of changes in crop prices.
Business	The founder, Bill Walsh, with a background in law and a passion to protect the natural environment, has built a nonprofit venture that has pioneered the awareness of toxicity issues in the building industry. He finds himself at a crossroads because he needs an infusion of cash to bring to market the database on building product toxicity that he has developed. The options include whether to radically change the way he manages his nonprofit in order to grow or to change the company status to a Benefit Corporation. Bill is unsure whether he is the right person to implement either alternative.
Education & Educational Research	The study explores the process of facilitation in professional development for educators. The study relies on discourse analysis of interaction among K-12 teachers and administrators in a Midwestern U.S. state during a semester-long professional development program especially designed for educators working with English language learners (ELLs). The study examines the facilitation practices employed by the lead facilitator of the professional development program from three analytical lenses: context as participation, context as ideology, tand content. The paper provides an empirical illustration of how recommendations in the literature about professional development for educators of ELLs can be put in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Development Studies	In this article we examine the use of population segmentation modelling for targeting fire prevention to the needs of the community. A population segmentation approach based upon socio-economic characteristics data was developed to provide a deeper understanding of the fire risks associated with different social groups by a partnership consisting of a UK fire and rescue service, a National Health Service trust, a local council, and a police force. This approach supported more targeted and co-ordinated community fire prevention measures by the agencies involved. This approach was used to target those most at risk and improve intra-agency co-ordination and collaboration between the agencies involved. The modelling enabled differences in terms of the risk of fire-related injuries and fatalities between the population segments to be examined. Overall, the research examines how and why population segmentation was undertaken by the fire and rescue service studied, and how this was implemented and used operationally to support fire prevention activities. The project was funded by the UK Department of Communities and Local Government.
Sociology	The integration and centralization of the European Union (EU) has thus far proceeded without the level of community building necessary to sustain a full-fledged fiscal union. At issue is not the absence of a political union or a democratic deficit' but the very limited post-national community building, a communitarian deficit. The insufficient sharing of values and bonds - not the poor representative mechanisms - is a major cause of alienation from Brussels' and limits the normative commitment to make sacrifices for the common good. Major community building measures, in normative intensive areas, such as education and language must take place if the proposed steps towards significantly greater economic unity are to succeed. But, it is precisely these areas where community building is most absent. Hence it is likely that the current crisis will lead to a scaling back of the EU as administrative state rather than to ever higher levels of integration.
History	This special issue intends to show the potential of medical history to contribute to major historical debates, e.g. on the rise of the welfare state. Together the articles in this issue make clear that medical history, for the twentieth century even more so than for earlier periods, is strongly embedded in social, cultural and political history. The second goal of the special issue is methodological. It aims to highlight the conceptual work being done by medical historians in oral history, digital history and the study of material culture. These methodologies allow them to expand the range of actors in the medical field: architects, missionaries, 'laypersons', advertisers and drug users all extend the medical field beyond the established categories of 'doctor' and 'patient'. Through their eyes, the particularities of twentieth-century health care become clear: the strong presence of mass media and public opinion, the role of international organisations and the redefining of patients as citizen- consumers entitled to health care.
Cultural Studies	This paper will argue that jazz emerges as samba's kindred foil in Brazilian popular music discourse of the 1940s and 1950s. Eager to underscore blood ties between idealized samba do morro and early blues and jazz, contributors to journals such as Diretrizes and Revista da Musica Popular nonetheless tended to equate postwar bebop and big band with the menacing venality of the US music industry and the vulgar fandom to which it was associated. It was amidst such critical ambivalence toward jazz that bossa nova arrived on the scene, acutely vulnerable to accusations not just of appropriation but also servile imitation and therefore second-hand decadence.
Linguistics	In our paper, we discuss the results of a questionnaire survey on the use of regional dialects in 173 kindergartens in Bavaria-Swabia. The data relate to the dialect use of 5 341 children, assessed by 380 of their kindergarten teachers. After some methodological reflexions, we present and interpret the results of the survey. The results are correlated with different factors, such as community size, the teachers` language use, and their attitude towards regional dialects. The overall finding is that less than 20 per cent of all children in Bavaria-Swabia speak a regional dialect.
Development Studies	This article interrogates the multifaceted political-economic networks entrenched within the multiple structures of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA). The main argument of this article is that crony capitalism is a defining feature of the PA's relations with a handful of capitalists and business groups. The demonstration of this argument is exhibited through the large-scale public and private monopolistic practices in strategic sectors of the Palestinian economy, which function within the framework of Israel's settler-colonial reality and the persistent patterns of international aid to the occupied West Bank. While acknowledging the existence of cronyism as a feature of the capitalist system in its diverse typologies, crony capitalism may be more pronounced in situations characterised by political uncertainty, whereby political-business collusion strategizes the expansion of neo-patrimonial networks and rent-seeking opportunities as a meta-mechanism for social control and political stabilisation. In the Occupied Palestinian Territories, crony capitalism was developed as part of the political allegiances and economic alliances that underpin the structures created by the Oslo process, which are fostered by Israeli policies and the international donor community to maintain the cohesiveness of the PA regime.
Management	This paper investigates knowledge hoarding, defined as an individual's deliberate and strategic concealment of information, and perceived hoarding, defined as coworkers' beliefs that an individual is engaged in hoarding. We hypothesize that knowledge hoarding increases an individual's job performance by enhancing bargaining power and influence, whereas perceived hoarding decreases the individual's job performance because coworkers withdraw social support. We further suggest that knowledge hoarding and perceived hoarding are both detrimental to unit performance because they hurt work-related interactions and impair the unit's ability to respond quickly to problems. Using a sample of 297 individuals embedded in 41 units in the U.S. Forest Service, we find that the positive effect of hoarding on individual performance is mediated by bargaining power, whereas the negative effect of perceived hoarding on individual performance is mediated by social support. In addition, individual hoarding and perceived hoarding both diminish unit performance. Collectively, our results reveal the mixed fortunes that befall individuals and their organizations as a result of knowledge hoarding and suspected hoarding activity.
Education, Special	According to Blatchford, learning support assistants (LSA) in schools within England comprise of a quarter of their workforce. In recent years, the inclusion of children with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream school settings has seen significant rises. Furthermore, the English government has raised expectations on the amount of physical education (PE) and school sport young people should engage in. This study examined the views, opinions and experiences of LSAs within England in relation to their perceived competence and confidence in supporting children with SEN in PE. Previous studies by Smith and Green, Morley et al. and Vickerman have noted widespread lack of training and professional development not only for LSAs, but also for PE teachers. Research by Morley et al. also indicates LSAs are more prevalent in other areas of the school curriculum than PE. This study surveyed 500 LSAs via a questionnaire in primary, secondary and special schools in England with a response rate of 142 (28.4%). This was followed up with interviews. The study found 63.3% of LSAs had received generic SEN training, whilst only 5.5% had received PE specific training. Of the 5.5% who received PE specific training 70.5% found it useful. Findings indicate best practice occurred when LSAs and PE teachers worked collaboratively in pedagogical planning and delivery. A model of effective LSA support for children with SEN in PE is proposed through which government and schools should consider adopting this model as a mechanism for reflecting, refining and delivering effective PE.
International Relations	Over recent years, Australia and Timor-Leste's bilateral relationship has been consumed by contested maritime boundary claims in the resource-rich Timor Sea. Intractable disagreements over the right to build a petroleum export pipeline have led Timor-Leste to reinvigorate its pursuit of permanent maritime boundaries as 'a national priority'. This article examines Timor-Leste's interests in the Timor Sea and assesses its strategies for achieving its foreign policy goals. It argues that Timor-Leste's attainment of its stated goals relies on Australia shifting its Timor Sea policy, which has been largely consistent since the 1970s. Timor-Leste's key strategy is a public diplomacy campaign that positions permanent maritime boundaries as the final stage of its independence struggle, and presents Timor-Leste as owning the disputed Greater Sunrise gas field under international law. While the public diplomacy campaign aims to win enough Australian 'hearts and minds' to put pressure on the Australian government, it ultimately fails to negotiate the strategic and historical realities of the interests that define Australia's realpolitik approach to the Timor Sea.

Criminology & Penology	Corroborating evidence has been associated with a decrease in children's distress during the court process, yet few studies have empirically examined the impact of evidence type on prosecution rates. This study examined the types of evidence and whether charges were filed in a sample of child sexual abuse cases (n = 329). Cases with a child disclosure, a corroborating witness, an offender confession, or an additional report against the offender were more likely to have charges filed, controlling for case characteristics. When cases were lacking strong evidence (confession, physical evidence, eyewitness), cases with a corroborating witness were nearly twice as likely to be charged. Charged cases tended to have at least two types of evidence, regardless of whether there was a child disclosure or not.
Substance Abuse	Background and ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of short-term memory impairment and schizophrenia-like symptoms in heavy and systematic cannabis users and the association between the severity of abuse and the longevity of its persistent symptoms after refraining from such use. MethodsA complete psychiatric examination and a psychometric evaluation were performed in 48 solely cannabis users. Additionally, head hair samples were analyzed and the detected cannabinoids levels were correlated with the psychometric findings. ResultsA total of 33.3% (n=16) of the total examined cannabis users were currently imprisoned. The years of abuse ranged from 1 to 35 years and the median daily dose was 5.84.4gr and 4.84.0gr for prisoners (n=16) and non prisoners (n=32), respectively. A total of 39.6% of the users experienced hallucinations (mostly auditory), 54.2% experienced delusions (mostly ideas of reference and persecution), 85.4% had organic brain dysfunction in a test addressing visual-motor functioning and visual perception skills, and all users (100%) were found to have organic brain dysfunction in a test of visual memory immediate recall. The cannabinoid metabolite levels in the hair samples were consistent with the reported history of substance abuse and total grams of consumption for the participants below 35 years old (p<.001). Statistically elevated cannabinoids levels were observed in users with auditory hallucinations compared to users without any hallucinations (p=.019). ConclusionsThe existence of hallucinations, delusions, and organic brain dysfunction in heavy cannabis users seems to be associated with cannabinoid levels in hair. The continuation of persistent symptoms 3 months after the discontinuation of cannabis abuse, was a remarkable finding. Scientific SignificanceWe provide evidence that chronic and heavy cannabis abuse results in long-lasting brain dysfunction in all users and in long-lasting schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms in more than half of all users. These findings suggest a reevaluation of the current classification of cannabis as a soft narcotic which erroneously, therefore, is typically considered harmless. (Am J Addict 2017;26:335-342)
Education, Special	More people with learning disabilities are living longer. This is a good news story! But, the bad news is that they do not live as long as the rest of the population. Health and other services need to be better organised to ensure that people with learning disabilities get better healthcare and other services which would help them lead more healthy lives. Most older people with learning disabilities live at home with their Mum or Dad, who are getting older too and find life more difficult. Care and support services need to adapt as families' needs change, but often this does not happen. We need to know more about these problems, which people with learning disabilities and their family carers face as they get older. This article looks at what we know and what more we need to find out to help older people with learning disabilities and their family carers live happier and healthier lives. Background: Growing numbers of people with learning disabilities are now living into older age. This study aims to examine the state of knowledge about their lives and the challenges that ageing has for both family carers and policymakers and practitioners. Materials and Methods: The article synthesises existing research in the fields of learning disability, ageing and family and social care with a view to learning lessons from these separate fields, identifying possibilities for collaboration and identifying gaps in knowledge. Results: The article concludes that existing research in the fields of ageing andfamily and social care can add significantly to an understanding of the impact of ageing on people with learning disabilities and their carers but, to date, there has been little collaboration or sharing of knowledge between the three areas. Conclusion: The article concludes that further research is required to fully understand the impact of ageing on the quality of life of people with learning disabilities and their family carers and to inform the design and delivery of services. A useful and productive way forward would be learn from and to work with researchers in cogniscent fields, notably, but not only, in the fields of social gerontology and family and social care.
History	While there are many tales of mining companies polluting the Canadian communities in which they have operated, Sudbury's early history stands out. It is arguably the most extreme example of an industry dictating to government how the latter dealt with the local pollution problem - in this case, sulphur dioxide emissions. The capstone achievement was the creation of an extrajudicial solution to the problem that permanently suspended the legal rights of residents seeking redress for their grievances. Moreover, the Ontario government was duplicitous in this affair - namely, by zealously luring settlers to the region in an effort to develop farming there even though it was acutely aware of the local pollution problem. Finally, this story is truly tragic because the pollution need never have happened to the extent that it did. The provincial politicians knew full well that the means existed - within a short jaunt of Sudbury no less - to mitigate the problem, but the politicians refused to force the mining firms to adopt them. Retelling Sudbury's story thus highlights how the Ontario government's decision to grant the mining firms practical impunity to pollute the local environment - both human and non-human - was a matter of political choice.
Family Studies	This article explores how the timing of parental divorce within a child's lifecourse can influence the obligations they feel to care for their parents later in life. The majority of studies have suggested that parental divorce that occurs earlier in a child's life will have the most detrimental effect on their filial obligations. Drawing on life-history interviews with 23 midlife participants in Southampton (UK) we challenge this contention by demonstrating how midlife experiences of parental divorce have weakened adult children's relationships with their parents, and we explore how this may impact on their future willingness to provide care. We also demonstrate how deteriorating marital relations have resulted in some older parents 'living together apart' and becoming socially withdrawn, which has weakened relationships with their midlife adult children who, as a result, expect to feel less willing to care for their parents in the future. These findings are presented within the context of rising divorce rates in older age groups and an informal care gap in the UK.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox displays how the use of a value (or number of standard deviations ) in a frequentist hypothesis test can lead to an inference that is radically different from that of a Bayesian hypothesis test in the form advocated by Harold Jeffreys in the 1930s and common today. The setting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, possibly with ""nuisance parameters"") versus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of nature of unknown strength). The value, as well as the ratio of the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the alternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian posterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The academic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this paradox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific communication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to frontier research in high energy physics. This paper is an attempt to explain the situation to both physicists and statisticians, in the hope that further progress can be made."
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Recent management research has evidenced the significance of organizational social networks, and communication is believed to impact the interpersonal relationships. However, we have little knowledge on how communication affects organizational social networks. This paper studies the dynamics between organizational communication patterns and the growth of organizational social networks. We propose an organizational social network growth model, and then collect empirical data to test model validity. The simulation results agree well with the empirical data. The results of simulation experiments enrich our knowledge on communication with the findings that organizational management practices that discourage employees from communicating within and across group boundaries have disparate and significant negative effect on the social network's density, scalar assortativity and discrete assortativity, each of which correlates with the organization's performance. These findings also suggest concrete measures for management to construct and develop the organizational social network.
Area Studies	Across Africa, One-Stop Border Posts are being rolled out as part of a continental/ regional integration agenda that seeks to facilitate the movement of people and goods. This article focuses on four OSBPs in East Africa and addresses the question, firstly, of how far they make a break with entrenched operational patterns within government bureaucracies, and secondly whether they represent a distinct type of border management regime? The article finds that while there has been progress on data sharing in Customs, the construction and management of OSBPs reflects the persistence of distinct institutional cultures within each country. Moreover, working practices involve practical workarounds which belie notions of a paperless border. Secondly, the article finds that OSBPs are unlike other border crossings and share some features with airports and seaports in that they have been designed to handle both cargo and people. But they differ in that they are not heavily securitized and represent co-produced spaces of interaction in which transporters and members of the surrounding community have helped to shape the organizational patterns. The outcomes fuse an official ideology of service, everyday bureaucratic practice and local understandings of ownership.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether trends in arrests for heroin, amphetamine-type substances (ATS) and cocaine can be used as indicators of trends in the use of these drugs. Design/methodology/approach - The question was addressed using ARIMA models to analyse the relationship between arrests and emergency department (ED) admissions for narcotics, amphetamine type substances (ATS) and cocaine. Findings - Strong positive correlations were found for the narcotics and cocaine series between arrests and EDs in the same month (contemporaneous correlation) and between arrests in the current month and overdoses in earlier months (lagged correlation). The contemporaneous correlation between ATS arrests and EDs was slightly less strong than the lagged correlations at two and four months. A jump in ATS EDs, was followed by a jump in arrests in the same month and then two and four months later. Practical implications - Arrests for narcotics use/possession, ATS use/possession and cocaine use/possession may in some circumstances provide useful intelligence about drug trends and/or a basis for evaluating the impact of police drug law enforcement activity on the use of narcotics, ATS and cocaine when other stronger measures of drug use are not available. Originality/value - Efforts to evaluate local drug law enforcement activity on illicit drug use have been hampered by poor measures of trends in illicit drug use at small area levels. This is the only study the authors are aware of that has examined the long-term relationship between illicit drug arrests and emergency department admissions for illicit drug use.
International Relations	This article argues that while the linguistic turn in mainstream IR is important in broadening how IR approaches global communications, the linguistic turn has its limitations because mainstream IR tends to, in Mattelart's terms, 'ex-communicate' the visual from the linguistic. This is highly problematic, considering, firstly, that popular visual language is increasingly the language that amateurs and experts rely upon in order to claim contemporary literacy and, secondly, that much politics is conducted through popular visual language. If the challenge of this Special Issue is to think about how to bring the discipline of IR to meaningful, political life, then a very good place to start is by asking mainstream IR (again) to take popular visual language seriously as an important aspect of contemporary global communication. This article makes this demand of the discipline of IR. It does so by presenting a case-study - the official US remediation of United Airlines Flight 93 - as an illustration of how contemporary global communications move from the textual to the visual and of what is lost in not taking this move seriously. In particular, it claims that by failing to analyse popular visual language as integral to global communications, mainstream IR risks misunderstanding contemporary subjectivity, spatiality, and temporality.
Management	This paper explores local and global dynamics underlying the development of knowledge services clusters, which we define as new geographic concentrations of technical talent and service providers offering upstream technical and knowledge-intensive business services to regional and global clients. Taking a co-evolutionary perspective on the development of knowledge services clusters in Latin America, based on data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN), we find that cluster growth results from intersecting trajectories: the emergence of local talent pools and capabilities initially serving local and regional demand; broadening global search for talent and expertise by multinational corporations; and internationalization strategies of service providers competing to serve global clients. Findings suggest that increasing commoditization of knowledge services opens up windows of opportunity for new clusters, but also involves challenges for sustainable growth. Results may stimulate future research on global sourcing and cluster development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	The World Health Organization project on the Global Burden of Disease quantifies the main causes of premature death and disability. Changing patterns of physical activity, diet, and alcohol and tobacco consumption are producing a growing burden of noncommunicable disease in low- and middle-income countries. This article focuses on a different group of health risks: major health emergencies that do not respect national borders and have an impact on health and the determinants of health such as housing, access to food and water, and other life essentials. Health emergencies, including accidents and natural events, are described, and data on disasters in the Middle East are presented. Disaster response is contrasted with disaster prevention, and disaster risk reduction is discussed in the context of vulnerability, climate change, and sustainable development. Finally, the international policy context of disaster risk reduction is discussed along with opportunities for multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional collaboration and research.
Urban Studies	Cities are naturally the center of attention when innovation and its geography are discussed. This paper seeks to elucidate the knowledge structures of the city innovation systems of Hong Kong and Singapore, and shed light on the performance of knowledge production, networks, and features in accordance with: (1) patent portfolios and fields of technology; (2) the patent landscape; and (3) the correlation map between fields and entities that produce patents. Findings indicate that private firms dominate the patenting landscape for the selected economies. Scientific activities performed by universities and public research institutions are converging with technological knowledge performed by firms. Hong Kong and Singapore sought to attain a co-evolution process for science-based industrial development.
Ethics	Since the adoption of the WTO-TRIPS Agreement in 1994, there has been significant controversy over the impact of pharmaceutical patent protection on the access to medicines in the developing world. In addition to the market exclusivity provided by patents, the pharmaceutical industry has also sought to further extend their monopolies by advocating the need for additional 'regulatory' protection for new medicines, known as data exclusivity. Data exclusivity limits the use of clinical trial data that need to be submitted to the regulatory authorities before a new drug can enter the market. For a specified period, generic competitors cannot apply for regulatory approval for equivalent drugs relying on the originator's data. As a consequence, data exclusivity lengthens the monopoly for the original drug, impairing the availability of generic drugs. This article illustrates how the pharmaceutical industry has convinced the US and the EU to impose data exclusivity on their trade partners, many of them developing countries. The key arguments formulated by the pharmaceutical industry in favor of adopting data exclusivity and their underlying ethical assumptions are described in this article, analyzed, and found to be unconvincing. Contrary to industry's arguments, it is unlikely that data exclusivity will promote innovation, especially in developing countries. Moreover, the industry's appeal to a property rights claim over clinical test data and the idea that data exclusivity can prevent the generic competitors from 'free-riding' encounters some important problems: Neither legitimize excluding all others.
Economics	In this article, we estimate the degree of substitution between enrolment into Disability Insurance (DI) and Unemployment Insurance (UI) in the Netherlands. Starting in the 1990s many policy measures aimed at reducing DI enrolment, and increase labour force participation. We quantify whether these policy measures have led to a reduction in hidden unemployment in DI. A side effect of the reforms may be increased pressure on UI. Therefore, we simultaneously estimate reverse substitution, that is, hidden disability in UI. To this end, we employ a sample of firms in the Dutch AVO database from the period 1993 to 2002. Using instrumental variables in a bivariate Tobit specification, we identify the hidden components in both respective schemes. The estimation results indicate that about 3% of all dismissals took place through DI, which implies that about one quarter of the DI enrolments observed in our sample in fact consists of hidden unemployment. We find no evidence for reverse substitution of disabled persons ending up in UI.
History	"This article unveils the hitherto overlooked tensions between Chile and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the formative years of the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet (from September 1973 to late 1977). This article shows that ideological affinity between the IMF and Pinochet""s economic team of ""Chicago Boys"" did not necessarily guarantee fruitful cooperation between the parties. The analysis of this intricate relationship sheds new light on the processes of economic neoliberalization that were conducted in Latin America, with different levels of IMF involvement, between the 1970s and the 1990s. By challenging axiomatic and simplistic approaches of IMF-Latin American relations, this article provides a unique prism to reconsider not only the IMF""s motivations and constraints, but also the proactive modus operandi of its borrowing member-states."
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether hearing impairment, highly prevalent in older adults, is associated with activity levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (2005-06). PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 70 and older who completed audiometric testing and whose physical activity was assessed subjectively using questionnaires and objectively using body-worn accelerometers (N = 706). MEASUREMENTS: Hearing impairment was defined according to the speech-frequency (0.5-4 kHz) pure-tone average in the better-hearing ear (normal <25.0 dB, mild 25.0-39.9 dB, moderate or greater >= 40 dB). Main outcome measures were self-reported leisure time physical activity and accelerometer-measured physical activity. Both were quantified using minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and categorized as inactive, insufficiently active, or sufficiently active. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted and adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Individuals with moderate or greater hearing impairment had greater odds than those with normal hearing of being in a lower category of physical activity as measured according to self-report (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.11-2.28) and accelerometry (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 0.99-2.91). Mild hearing impairment was not associated with level of physical activity. CONCLUSION: Moderate or greater hearing impairment in older adults is associated with lower levels of physical activity independent of demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Future research is needed to investigate the basis of this association and whether hearing rehabilitative interventions could affect physical activity in older adults.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	'Molecular biology' emerged in the first half of the twentieth century as a fundamentally novel type of biology. Its coming into being was by no means simply a linear continuation of classical genetics, the biological Leitwissenschaft of the time, and it took much more than new methods and technologies for the new discipline to arise. In this article I outline the development of molecular biology-from its beginnings to its zenith and dissolution as a discipline in its own right-in its historical context and from an epistemological perspective.
History Of Social Sciences	Alexander Bain (1818-1903) is well known for his two influential textbooks, The senses and the intellect (1855) and The emotions and the will (1859). In comparison, Bain's Mind and body: The theories of their relation (1872) has been of limited interest to historians, and it is here where he presents one of the first neural network models. This paper addresses the historical foundations of Bain's neural network model and explores some of his primary influences. Additionally, this study addresses some of the reasons Bain's Mind and Body did not receive the historical notice his earlier works garnered.
Criminology & Penology	This study examines gang-motivated homicides in Chicago neighborhoods between 1985 and 1995. Qualitative studies have illustrated that gang-motivated homicides may have different characteristics than other types of homicides. Particularly at the neighborhood level, gang homicides have not yet been fully studied, and thus little is known about the interaction between gang violence and the neighborhoods they operate in. By examining the effects of social disorganization on both gang-related homicides and other types of homicides-such as intimate killings and homicides committed during street robberies-this study explores the relative uniqueness of gang homicides. Results indicate that social disorganization theory helps explain various types of homicides, including gang homicides. Nonetheless, gang homicides are also different from other types of homicides, justifying more research that looks at these homicides as a unique type of violence.
Area Studies	Ethnic and national identities are shaped and evolve in the context of complex negotiations sustained among multiple players, each with its own and often contradicting interests. This study focuses on one unique cultural group, the Druze in Israel, and examines a multifaceted identity constructed as a direct result of policies and expectations of members and institutions of majority groups. My aim is to explore how this identity is defined within the complex intergroup context, the various components and their inter-relations (congruent or conflictual), and the way its boundaries are shaped through interaction with other identities in Israel. The analysis of the interviews conducted with 50 Druze university students in Israel yielded three major content categories: 'Druze by blood;' 'Arab, but less so;' and 'Being Israeli.' The Druze identity is constructed in primordialist terms, and a central role is assigned to the belief in reincarnation. The Arab identity is categorized primarily as a national one, and it is strongly affected by the negative attitude of Arabs toward the service of the Druze in the Israeli army. Three major aspects emerged in relation to the Israeli identity of the Druze: the fact of their being citizens of the State of Israel, the attitude of the state and of Jews toward them, and the army service. Our study portrays a highly complex and problematic constellation of group identities, shaped as a delicate adaptation to the unique position of a group subject to multiple political forces in the past and present.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	"The basic structure of contemporary military biopolitics, in which military bodies and minds are kept alive and allowed to die, entails both an institutional problem of how to shore up life that is exposed to harm and a cultural problem of how to reckon with a routinized trade in life and death that happens not incidentally, but on purpose. Amidst this tension, the military psyche becomes both an inhabited, embodied site and an imaginative point of reference for the question of how to feel about war. This article takes stock of the contemporary landscape of war-related mental affliction via three relatively novel interventions: military suicide prevention, the framing post-traumatic stress as ""moral injury,"" and resiliency training meant to inoculate soldiers against the stress of the battlefield. Drawing on a range of clinical and media sources and ethnographic research with post-9/11 military personnel, I show how each of these efforts constructs specific forms of war-related psychic destruction as objects of public and institutional concern, normalizes the institutional arrangements that produce it, and informs public perceptions of what war is by constructing figures of what it does to those who fight it."
Social Issues	Due to weak state and administrative capacity, the Russian government has involved resource-rich non-state actors into policy-making since about 2005 and established numerous institutionalized platforms, networks, and forums. These networks mainly emerge on regional and local levels and are designed to generate policy advice, implement decisions, and contribute to output legitimacy. A crucial question is how the authorities govern and regulate these bodies under the terms of a hybrid regime. The paper sheds light on why and how state authorities interact with non-state actors and unravels functions and flavors of governance networks in Russia. Drawing on the empirical results of case studies on anti-drug policy conducted in the regions Samara and St Petersburg, the paper reveals that state dominance within networks is a significant characteristic, although authorities rarely apply explicit 'hard' tools of government onto collaborations with non-state actors. The paper also allows for theorizing on the role of governance networks in a hybrid regime.
Anthropology	A representationalist-constructivist bias is prevalent in contemporary anthropological research on meaning making, particularly research on large-scale domains of human life. This bias assumes that conceptual and imagined forms of sign processing originate and determine all significance manifesting in environments signifying as greater than local. Lived experience, however, also can originate and influence, if not fully determine, large-scale processes of meaning making. The case of rock climbing in Yosemite National Park illustrates the inscription and the processual emergence of symbolism into and out of bodily experience. Climbers internalize technical disciplines preconceived by translocal-in some respects, market-driven-multinational interests and emplace them into the Yosemite landscape while simultaneously originating significance via bodily encounters that are unmediated by conventional symbolic processes. Postphenomenological frameworks foreground how climbers' unmediated bodily encounters bring into being generative lines of symbolism capable of reconfiguring previously established translocal structures of representation.
Cultural Studies	This joint article starts with Finland's nation branding to look at image-building activities as context and path-dependent activities. The main empirical example will be Finland's image-building efforts between 1988 and 2011. Despite changes in tone and methods, the 2011 Mission for Finland-report on the nation's brand and the 1990 Kantine-report were both parts of a continuum in Finland's image policy practices. In an effort to contribute to studies drawing historical comparisons between image crafting policies, we would like to suggest that different contexts in fact produced different patterns of the same phenomenon, different expressions of the same urge to present Finland to the world for what was perceived as pressing political, economic, and identity-based reasons. On this basis, our article suggests a series of variables with which to organise differences and similarities between the development of Finland's 1980s-1990s public diplomacy and its 2008-2011 branding committee and following campaign.
Education & Educational Research	"This paper explores indigenization and globalization, the double issue of curriculum and identity as a dialectical contradiction that characterizes the ambivalence of ""Taiwanese identity."" ""Taiwanese identity"" is treated as a social, political, and cultural construct rather than a fixed term in an essentialist sense. Curriculum, as culture's medium of social identity construction, represents a struggle over who constructs whose identity and what is constructed. Therefore, when curriculum reform is called for, it is also a time when a society transitioning and redrawing its socio-political and cultural boundaries to resolve internal social conflicts and identity anxiety. Curriculum reform, in this paper, is analyzed not only as a question of shifting explicit ideas of educational practice but also a question of shifting configurations in power relations that signify a politics of identity. The historical context that brought about the question of identity in Taiwan is introduced first. The second section discusses how emerging curricula were politically, socially, and culturally implicated in the process of constructing a Taiwan-centric identity. The third section analyzes the political, social, cultural, and educational implications of new curricula oil the formation of a Taiwan-centric identity. Finally, the paper discusses the effect of globalization on the practice of new curricula and points out an ambivalence of local-global identity construction and the conflicting roles of education, especially curriculum, in this ambivalence.

Industrial Relations & Labor	Federal enactments extend benefits and provide Federal funding to the States to cover costs, and additional enactments include other provisions affecting the unemployment insurance program; State enactments include provisions regarding extended benefits, work sharing, tax schedules, and taxable wage bases
Industrial Relations & Labor	Some families may have too little wealth (or liquidity) to finance a long-distance move, which may involve transportation costs and foregone earnings. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the author assesses whether wealth holdings directly influence migration decisions in the United States. The analysis focuses on long-distance migration and shows consistently that migration is common among households with little or negative net worth and that greater wealth does not increase the likelihood of migration. In addition, differential wealth holdings do not explain why minority groups and the less-educated are relatively unlikely to undertake long-distance moves. The author also finds little evidence that wealth holdings influence a person's migration response to local labor demand shocks.
Education & Educational Research	This qualitative case study examines teachers' implicit meaning systems built around their core beliefs on the malleability of human qualities. Previous research has demonstrated the influence of students' implicit theories on motivation and achievement and has presented successful interventions for students. However, research on teachers' implicit theories and, in particular, their actualization in natural environments is lacking. The data for this study include observations and stimulated recall interviews with two Finnish teachers whose opposing implicit theories were first indicated in 2000 by Carol Dweck . The results depict how these teachers' implicit meaning systems influence their ways of interpreting students' behavior, learning, and achievements, which in turn guide teachers' pedagogical thinking as well as their practices for motivating the students. However, these Finnish teachers' implicit theories also appear to be intertwined with culture-bound assumptions, and the classroom implementation of these theories was observed to vary situationally.
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Economists have long recognized that occupations can be used as proxies for skills in wage regressions. Yet the potential existence of non-market factors such as discrimination and occupational choice (sorting) on the basis of job attributes that are separate from, but potentially correlated with, wages makes occupations an imperfect control for skills. In this paper, we consider whether inter-occupational wage differentials that are unexplained by measured human capital are indeed due to differences in unmeasured skill. Using the National Compensation Survey, a large, nationally-representative dataset on jobs and ten different components of job requirements, we compare the effects on residual wage variation of including occupation indicators and these skill requirements measures. We find that although these skill requirements vary across 3-digit occupations, occupation indicators decrease wage residuals by far more than can be explained by skill alone. This indicates that ""controlling for occupation"" does not equate to controlling for only these skill measures, but also for other factors. Additionally, we find that there is considerable within-occupation variation in skill requirements, and that the amount of variation is not constant across skill levels. As a result, including occupation indicators in a wage model introduces heteroskedasticity that must be accounted for. We suggest that caution be applied when using and interpreting occupation indicators as controls in wage regressions."
Transportation	Employing the theory of planned behavior for guidance, this study explores the similarities and differences in beliefs about the decisions to commute by bicycle to work in three small, cycling-oriented cities: Gouda (The Netherlands), Shkodra (Albania), and Peja (Kosovo). The setting in the Balkan Peninsula, a less developed region of Europe which has been more rarely the subject of scientific inquiry, has the potential to offer applicability to (smaller) developing cities. The study identifies the following themes or beliefs related to cycling: (1) health and exercise (2) environment (3) safety (4) enjoyment (5) convenience and practicality (6) financial savings (7) pride and tradition (8) status and image and (9) female independence. The findings suggest that, in developing cities changes to the physical environment alone - although crucial - are likely to be insufficient if travel modes are to shift toward active transport. To this end attitudes and perceptions need to be tackled as well. In promoting cycling, policy makers need to strike a fine balance between the concept of the bicycle as an economical mode and as a trendy one. The most promising way forward appears to be a combination of public infrastructure investments, cycling tracks in particular, and social marketing strategies to alter travel behavior.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To describe factors predictive of nursing home (NH) adherence to a clinical trial intervention. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a cluster randomized trial (CRT) evaluating a structured communication intervention to improve nurse-physician telephone communication in NHs. SETTING: NH. PARTICIPANTS: All eligible licensed nursing staff in all participating NHs. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence was defined as active participation for at least 3 months of the 12-month trial. NH characteristics hypothesized to affect trial outcomes (profit status, bed size, nursing staff time, NH quality, and leadership turnover) were measured a priori. The association between intervention adherence, NH characteristics and preintervention questionnaire response rate was examined. RESULTS: Of 13 intervention NHs, seven adhered to the intervention. Three factors differentiated adherent from nonadherent NHs: director of nursing turnover (nonadherent NHs 50% vs adherent NHs 0%, P =.03); Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) nurse staffing rating (range: 1-5) (nonadherent NHs mean 3.7 +/- 0.5 vs adherent NHs mean 4.3 +/- 0.5), P =.048); and questionnaire response rate (nonadherent NHs 15.6 +/- 10.0% vs adherent NHs 34.2 +/- 12.1%, P =.02). Profit status, bed size, and number of NH deficiencies on state surveys were not significantly associated with intervention adherence. CONCLUSION: CMS nurse staffing rating, leadership turnover, and questionnaire response rate are associated with adherence to a CRT intervention. Pretrial evaluation of NH staffing rating by CMS and of response to a questionnaire can help investigators improve trial efficiency by screening for NHs likely to adhere to a CRT intervention.

Information Science & Library Science	This article examines the status of the book review as a form of scholarly publication in the humanities, looking at the role and characteristics of humanities book reviews and at who writes them and why. It examines evidence for the influence and impact of book reviews in the humanities and makes suggestions for the future of the scholarly book review in an online information environment.
Environmental Studies	The Cevennes National Park in the South of France is a major and viable example of Mediterranean ancestral agro-pastoralism that represents the relationship between agro-pastoral systems and their biophysical environment. These characteristics are recognized by a UNESCO label. Nevertheless, this medieval heritage is endangered by short-term agricultural economic strategies aiming to boost competitiveness. Our research uses Ostrom's social-ecological systems as an analytical framework to explore systemic inter-dependencies among natural, social and economic processes which lead to the production of environmentally and socially beneficial outcomes. Our results highlight the role of the National Park and of local collective strategies in countering individual land management approaches in order to preserve agro-pastoral systems.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Many academic fields use content analysis. At the core of most common content analysis lies frequency distribution of individual words. Websites and documents are mined for usage and frequency of certain words. In this article, we introduce a community-contributed command, wordfreq, to process content (online and local) and to prepare a frequency distribution of individual words. Additionally, another community-contributed command, wordcloud, is introduced to draw a simple word cloud graph for visual analysis of the frequent usage of specific words.
Gerontology	Aim: To assess the impact of an enhanced primary care service for residential aged care facilities (RACF) on the transfer of patients from RACF to a hospital emergency department (ED). Methods: A before-after study of an enhanced primary care service provided by experienced ED-based nurses under the governance of general practitioners. The intervention was analysed comparatively using standardised normal deviates and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, complemented by qualitative assessment. Results: There was a statistically significant reduction (17%, P < 0.001) in the number of transfers during the intervention period. This finding held when adjusting for the seasonality of ED referrals over a 4-year period. The intervention was highly valued by clinicians in RACF and ED. Conclusion: Enhanced primary care services reduce the number of transfers to ED from RACF.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Background: The incidence and hematological effects of helminth infection during pregnancy were investigated among pregnant women in Isiala, Mbano, Southeast Nigeria. Methods: Totally 282 pregnant women were enlisted for the study between October 2011 and September 2012. Stool samples were examined for intestinal helminths using formalin-ether sedimentation technique. Hemoglobin (Hb) and Packed Cell Volume (PCV) levels were evaluated in venous blood samples using Sahli's and microhaematocrit methods respectively. Results: Forty six (16.3%) subjects were infected with at least one helminth parasite; 24 (8.5%) hookworm, 14(5.0%) and 2(0.7%) A. lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infections respectively. Intestinal helminthiases in pregnant women was significantly associated with age (P<0.05). The prevalence of intestinal helminthiases by parity was also significantly different (P<0.05) with primigravidae having the highest infection rate (27.5%). Hematological assessment showed that the prevalence of anemia among the women was 58.9% (mean +/- SD = 9.3 +/- 1.0). The differences in hemoglobin levels by age groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The contributory effect of gastrointestinal helminths in anemia showed that infected pregnant women had lower mean hemoglobin (8.60 +/- 0.22g/dl) than the uninfected (9.72 +/- 0.07g/dl). Significant difference (t-value = 5.660, P < 0.05) was observed between the Hb of the infected and uninfected pregnant women. In addition, infected pregnant women had mean PCV of 26.09 +/- 0.65% while the uninfected had 34.54 +/- 2.96%. The mean PCV of infected pregnant women was significantly different (t-value = 0.013, P < 0.05) from that of the uninfected. Conclusion Anti-helminthic therapy after the first trimester should be part of the antenatal programme. Intestinal helminth infection showed significant negative correlation with Hb and PCV and contributed moderately to anemia.
Political Science	"Part of the project ""Dynamic De/Centralization in Federations,'' this article measures dynamic de/centralization in India since its founding in 1950 and seeks to account for observed patterns in terms of changes over time. India's federation was considerably centralized at birth across its legislative, administrative, and fiscal dimensions. It has since undergone further cumulative centralization in the legislative sphere, while little change has occurred in the other two spheres. The principal instruments of dynamic centralization have been constitutional change and court rulings. Several aspects of India's constitutional framework have facilitated the further accretion of legislative powers to the center. Centralization has been driven by a desire for policy uniformity and an emphasis on national interests and security. The transformation in the party system since the 1970s has not had a discernible impact on the system's degree of de/centralization. In turn, India's extreme societal diversity has not presented a major obstacle to centralization or produced significant demands for decentralization."
Industrial Relations & Labor	In a 2012 article, Sabia, Burkhauser, and Hansen reported very large negative effects of the 2004 to 2006 increase in the New York State minimum wage on the employment of young, less-educated workers. Hoffman reexamines their estimates using data from the full Current Population Survey (CPS), rather than the smaller CPS-MORG files they used, and finds no evidence of a negative employment impact. The full CPS, which is the source of U.S. official labor market statistics, is certainly the more appropriate and reliable data source. Furthermore, when Hoffman repeats the analysis using three states and the District of Columbia, which also had a substantial increase in the state minimum wage in the same time period, he finds evidence of a small positive employment effect. Together, the two findings are consistent with other, more recent research that reports very weak or zero employment effects of the minimum wage.
Nursing	This study proposed an evaluation model, derived from the Technology Acceptance Model and Information System Success Model, to explore factors influencing the acceptance of hospital information systems by nurses. Although many healthcare institutions have applied hospital information systems, relatively few studies have investigated the perceptions of nurses regarding the usefulness, ease of use, or acceptance of these systems. This study recruited the nursing staff of a regional hospital in Taiwan. A total of 297 questionnaires were sent, and 277 were returned, for a response rate of 93.3%. The results indicated that system quality, information quality, and service quality were positively correlated with the perceived ease of use (R-2 = 0.69) and perceived usefulness (R-2 = 0.72). Information quality has the greatest influence on perceived usefulness (gamma(3) = 0.57, P < .001) and ease of use (gamma(4) = 0.61, P < .001). Perceived usefulness and ease of use have a significant influence on system acceptance (R-2 = 0.75). Perceived usefulness (beta(1) = 0.61, P < .001) has a significant influence on system acceptance. These findings indicated that nursing care requires high-quality healthcare information to support the daily activities of nursing professionals. The results of this study also provide a valuable reference for hospital administrators in developing hospital information systems.
Transportation	The EU/US Open Skies agreement became operational on March 29th, 2008. The 23% increase in flights between Ireland and the US in 2008 under the agreement is the highest expected increase under the agreement and is almost three times greater than the expected overall increase in air travel between the EU and the US. Open Skies increases the number of routes between Ireland and the US by 3 to 10 and allows airlines to fly directly to and from Dublin without a compulsory stop at Shannon. There are very strong economic, investment, visitor, political and ethnic ties between Ireland and the US and air travel between the countries per head of population in Ireland is 5.6 times greater than the EU average. The benefits from Open Skies include lower fares, new routes and direct services reducing the need to backtrack over European hubs, in addition to the abolition of the requirement to stopover at Shannon.

Economics	The Chinese Government has stepped up its drive to reconstruct its international financial strategy after the sub-prime crisis developed into a global financial crisis in 2008. The main aim of the strategy is to reduce the country's dependence on the US dollar in foreign trade, cross-border capital flows and foreign exchange reserve management. The strategy can be divided into three tiers: renminbi internationalization, regional monetary cooperation and reconstruction of the international monetary regime. So far, the Chinese Government has fared well in the application of all three tiers. We hold that the Chinese Government should continue in the same direction in a coordinated manner despite various challenges it faces.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Culture is a key issue in the development of marketing communications in international markets as cultures develop distinctive preferences for visual and verbal communications. The individualistic nature of American culture lends itself to a preference for simple, direct visual communication and low-context verbal communication. Koreans are expected to prefer more symbolic communication like complex visuals and high-context verbal communication. This mixed-method study employed an experimental design to examine the effects of context on attitude-to-the-advertisement and attitude-to-the-brand. Sixty-four Korean international students and 64 U.S. American students participated. As hypothesised, Koreans reacted more favourably to advertisements with complex visuals and high-context text. Americans did not exhibit a strong preference for any specific advertisement type. A follow-up interview study examined the reasons for the quantitative findings.
Ethnic Studies	On May 6, 2015, the Chicago City Council adopted legislation that formally sought to repair the damage wrought by a decades-long pattern of police torture. After months of careful negotiations between City Hall and the advocates for torture survivors, the council unanimously passed a package of laws providing for both financial and nonfinancial compensation, or reparations, for torture survivors and their families. While this package of laws limited financial compensation solely to the survivors of torture, it did extend nonfinancial compensation to them and their families in the form of free psychological counseling, job training, and college education, as well as inclusion of the torture cases in the public high school curriculum and a formal statement of remorse on behalf of the city. Drawing on the successful passage of this reparations legislation, this chapter identifies the intervention of the grassroots group Black People Against Police Torture (BPAPT) as pivotal in overcoming entrenched pro-law enforcement opposition to demands for accountability and redress. In particular, this article argues that the crucial contribution of BPAPT was its adoption of a strategic approach to international human rights law and institutions that prompted subsequent breakthroughs at the local, state, and federal level.
Economics	We provide a new perspective on the impact of unauthorized copying and copy levies on artistic creation. Our analysis emphasizes three aspects of artistic markets: the predominance of superstars, the important role of promotion expenditures, and the difficulties of talent-sorting. In the short run, piracy reduces superstars' earnings and market share and increases the number of niche and young artists. In the long run, copying can also have a positive effect on high-quality artistic creation by helping more young artists start their careers, which increases the number of highly talented artists in subsequent periods. The long-term impact of levies on copy equipment on artistic creation depends on whether their yields primarily accrue to superstars who already receive rents or are allocated to help young artists.

Cultural Studies	This essay examines wartime Japan's establishment of culture bureaus and its promotion of the Takarazuka Girls' Revue in allied European nations and the United States in a moment of international crisis. This overseas cultural policy was part of a series of alternative strategies employed by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an effort to persuade the West to acknowledge Japan's self-appointed role as a leader in East Asia, capable of producing advanced cultural products on a par with those of western nations. Key features of this essay include the negotiation between state goals and private interests in the performance of cultural diplomacy, as well as the aesthetic articulation of a hybrid Japanese culture which was traditional yet fully modern, particularly as presented on stage through a display of the female body.
Cultural Studies	I wanted to 'redeem' indigo in the sense Walter Benjamin portrays history in his theses on the philosophy of history, and I wanted to do this around an 'object' that's been around at least 2000 years and has the history of Europe as an extension of India, China, the Middle East and the Caribbean implanted in its soul. That this object is also a colour made my task that much more feasible.
Family Studies	Having initial intentions to marry increases cohabitors' likelihood of marriage, yet some cohabitors with such plans do not marry. One explanation for non-marriage may be that prior union experiences and the challenges of raising shared or stepchildren could temper initially strong marital intentions. Using the 2011-15 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), I examine prospective marital expectations among 531 current cohabitors in short-term unions (<= 36 months) who report they were engaged or had definite plans to marry at the start of coresidence, focusing on prior union experiences, stepchildren, shared children, and pregnancy. A fifth of current cohabitors with initial marital intentions did not definitely expect to marry their partner, and the odds of definite expectations were lower if respondents' partners had children from a prior union and higher if respondents were expecting a child. Prior union experiences, shared children, and the respondent's own prior children were unrelated to expectations.
Rehabilitation	This project investigated music therapy (MT) in managing anxiety associated with weaning from mechanical ventilation. The use of sedation to treat anxiety during weaning is problematic because side effects (e.g., respiratory depression) are precisely the symptoms that cause the weaning process to be interrupted and consequently prolonged. Study goals were to determine the feasibility of incorporating MT into the weaning process and to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention, based on levels of anxiety, Days to Wean (DTW), and patient/nurse satisfaction. Adult patients received multiple MT sessions per week while undergoing weaning trials from mechanical ventilation. Feasibility was determined by successful enrollment in the study and nurse survey. Efficacy was evaluated through anxiety, as measured by heart rate, respiratory rate, and patient/nurse survey; DTW; and patient/nurse satisfaction. Nurse surveys reported that MT was successfully incorporated into the milieu and 61 subjects were enrolled. Significant differences in heart rate and respiratory rate were found from the beginning to the end of MT sessions (p < .05 and p < .0001, respectively), indicating a more relaxed state. No significant difference in mean DTW was found between study and control subjects. Patient/nurse satisfaction was high. Music therapy can be used successfully to treat anxiety associated with weaning from mechanical ventilation. Limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Since Hofstede introduced his approach to understanding cultural differences through dimensions of national culture, various authors have presented their own dimensions, sometimes similar, sometimes different, and sometimes partially overlapping. The status quo in the development of research on cultural dimensions can now be qualified by two words: enriched and messy. Some scholars have attempted to bring the most likely common denominators of the dimensions together in an overview, but these attempts were based on ad hoc considerations and common sense. The goal of this article is to come to a synthesis of the insights from relevant authors and present a set of clusters of cultural dimensions based on systematic theoretical and statistical analysis. This is done by testing the conceptually established clusters through an ecological factor analysis. We included the work produced by Hofstede, Inglehart, Schwartz, GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness), Minkov, and a number of well-known qualitative authors, ending up with nine exclusive clusters: Individualism versus Collectivism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance (UA), Mastery versus Harmony, Traditionalism versus Secularism, Indulgence versus Restraint, Assertiveness versus Tenderness, Gender Egalitarianism, and Collaborativeness.
Ethics	The article analyses the relation of E. V. Ilyenkov to the phenomenon of language. His approach, it is shown, had its roots in his explication of notion of ideal which led him to assign priority to work with respect to language at a general level as well as at the level ontogenesis of human infants. Two additional factors shaped his approach to the phenomenon of language. The first was his negative approach to disciplines investigating the structure of language: mathematical logic, logical semantics, and philosophy of language. The second was his treatment of Hegel's philosophy from which he took over only those features that were appropriated and further developed by Marx. The article gives an analysis of Ilyenkov's view on the educational process of deafblind children and it shows that this view contradicted the views on that process presented in the works of Meshcheryakov and Sirotkin. Finally, the article provides a characterization of work, language and of their relation.
Rehabilitation	Individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often face a number of barriers in family planning and pregnancy. These barriers can be structural (i.e. inaccessible health care provider offices and providers unfamiliar with fertility, pregnancy, and SCI) or social (i.e. friends, family, and even providers suggesting that individuals with SCI should not have children), and can affect both men and women. Additionally, much of the information about SCI and pregnancy is from a medical perspective and the psychosocial aspects of pregnancy for individuals with SCI have not been considered. 253 men and women with SCI were asked about the information they received about SCI and pregnancy, where they received this information, and how their SCI affected their family planning. The responses shared in this study can be used to inform individuals who work with people with SCI to better assist their clients or patients who have sustained SCI and are considering pregnancy.
Social Issues	Starting from the basic demographic trends, with the share of persons older than 65 years of age of 15.7%, Croatia matches the average of the EU member states. Since ageing of the population represents one of the greatest challenges that the world is faced with, the position of the elderly in society, quality of life in the older age and trends in the policy of care for the elderly are the matter of interest of political, professional and scientific-research circles of the largest number of the developed countries in the world. The analysis of the trends in the care for the elderly in EU member states, as well as in the Republic of Croatia, indicates the promotion of healthy and active ageing, which is regarded as the key for ensuring an equal role of the persons of the third age in society. A common strategy for most policies of care for the elderly in European countries includes strengthening of the community care, in the sense of developing non-institutional forms of care. Namely, unlike the trends in European countries, where the policy of care for the elderly is increasingly focused on provision of help in their homes, in an attempt to keep elderly persons in their own homes, the trends in the care for the elderly in the Republic of Croatia only partly follow the ones on the level of the EU due to insufficient development of local forms of management of systems of the care for the elderly, inadequate network of the institutional forms of care, underdeveloped and insufficiently clear systems of financing and so on. Ageing changes society in important and fundamental elements of its functioning, and demands a complex assessment and reorganisation of the economic and social political framework.
Education, Special	The phenomenon of using progress monitoring data to inform literacy instruction was explored in the context of four schools during their 2nd year of Reading First implementation. Open-ended interviews and surveys from 10 teachers, purposefully selected for maximum variation in effectiveness and skills and resistance to using data to inform instruction, were primary data sources. Across schools, teachers reported varying levels of success with using data to inform instruction. A grounded theory model of how K-1 teachers worked with reading coaches to try to use data to inform instruction was developed through axial coding. The coach's role was to help teachers access and interpret data and make informed links to reading curricula. Perceived barriers to the practice of using the data included lack of time and classroom management difficulties.
Substance Abuse	This study assessed the discrepancies between reports from parents and adolescents concerning family relationships and the use of tobacco and alcohol by adolescents. Data were obtained from a sample of 2015 parent adolescent dyads recruited from 30 junior high schools in Taipei City and Taouyun County, Taiwan, in 2010. The results indicated that more than 90% of parent adolescent dyads agreed to no tobacco/alcohol use by adolescents. More than half (38 parents; 68%) of responding parents were unaware of the tobacco use that was reported by 56 adolescents in this study. A high percentage (133 parents; 93.7%) of the responding parents were unaware of the alcohol use reported by 142 adolescents in this study. Parents reported higher levels of parent adolescent attachment, communication, monitoring and teaching than was reported by their adolescent children. Multivariate logistic regression results showed that lower ratings by adolescents on questions of family attachment, poor academic performance and delinquent behaviour were associated with parental unawareness of tobacco use. Likewise, low adolescent ratings of family communication and delinquent behaviour by adolescents could be used to predict parental unawareness of alcohol use by their adolescent children.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Invasive species are the subject of much debate and attention. Social scientific analyses of alien species have focused on rhetoric about invaders, arguing that the discourse about invasive species reflects how people think about nature, culture and agency. In this article, I argue for a focus not only on discourse, but also on what happens in practice in the encounter between field scientists and invasive animals. Through ethnographic fieldwork on Guadalupe Island in Mexico, I analyze both the place of islands in the Mexican nation and invasive species eradication programs as examples of 'care of the pest', that is, projects in which scientists carefully tend to invasive organisms in order to produce knowledge about them. This knowledge is then used against the animals to exterminate them in a 'biology of betrayal', and occasionally, animals are enlisted into these projects to aid scientists in eradicating fellow members of their species. This article shows how changing perceptions of the value of island ecologies affected the use of the land and the fates of the animals on Guadalupe Island as the island was variously configured as laboratory, field site and slaughterhouse.
Cultural Studies	This article discusses practices of hygienism and social cleansing in Brazilian urban spaces. It takes the case of a traditional fishing community, located in north-eastern Brazil, that is under the threat of being evicted from the area occupied for more than 60 years, while locals are accused of pursuing dangerous and violent ways of life. These practices are considered, from a Foucauldian perspective, as part of biopolitcal strategies connected with state racism, that in contemporary society underpin a discourse of social security and development. It also discusses how the criminalization of certain social groups is used to justify, on the one hand, the restriction to certain spaces, and, on the other, privileged forms of access to public space.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	It is often said that the triumph of Dumas' Le chevalier de Maison-Rouge. Un episode du temps des Girondins was a precursory sign to the 1848 revolution. Yet, in the year prior, critics showed entirely different opinions; conservatives were enthusiastic, whereas republicans hid poorly their reservations towards a play that, according to them, ridiculed the revolution and the Parisian sans-culottes. The enormous success of this play therefore forces the question: had they seen the same play? What had the censors and critics missed? And on the other hand, what was it that seduced the lower-class Parisian public?
Area Studies	The Hawar Islands dispute, resolved in 2001, is the only territorial dispute between two Arab states that has been resolved by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Several factors played a role in influencing Qatar and Bahrain to resolve their dispute at the ICJ: 1) the inability of Arab states and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to mediate the dispute, 2) incentives for significant oil and natural gas reserves, and 3) incentives for bilateral and regional cooperation on salient issues between the two states. Both states have benefited significantly since the resolution of the dispute.
Social Issues	This article combines research on incentives with nonprofit organization theories to derive three nonprofit characteristics that influence the use and effectiveness of incentive mechanisms in nonprofit organizations: the lack of undistorted contractible measures for the organization's overall performance, the relevance of identified employee motivation and the social relationships between the organization and its stakeholders. Building on research from social psychology, the article argues for a more deliberate use of implicit (i.e., not contractually defined) incentives rather than a shift toward the increased use of performance contracts. Because implicit incentives are often subtle (without the need of formal justification to others) and emergent rather than planned, managers are frequently not aware of these mechanisms, and their deliberate use creates a major challenge.
Information Science & Library Science	This article articulates the findings of two research studies. The first, a national survey, explores the educational background and current job responsibilities of media librarians. The second, a web analysis, assesses media-related curriculum components of accredited library and information science programs. Conclusions support anecdotal evidence that media librarians receive the majority of their education regarding media-related issues on the job.
Urban Studies	Compact-city planning factors are commonly applicable even to metropolitan areas. In most cases, however, planning policies based on theses factors fail to consider that travel patterns are not uniform in each metropolitan area. Furthermore, the travel pattern of inter- and intra-municipality that results from spatial interaction between a central city and its various sub-centres and suburbs in a metropolitan area has not been fully explored. A consideration of the specific urban system could therefore provide an answer to the question of why certain factors have different effects on the transit modal split and car travel distance between municipalities of a metropolitan area. The aim of this study was therefore to find an effective way to establish compact-city planning policies in municipalities of the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). An investigation of the changed travel pattern in each municipality based on the changed relationship between transit modal split (TMS) and intra-city trip ratio by car (ITR) between 2006 and 2010 found that the SMA became more car-dependent: TMS and ITR of the municipalities declined together, and ITR decreased much more in the outskirts. Based on the relationship between the two factors, the effects of changes in land use and transportation were estimated using a combination of cluster and regression analysis. This revealed that, in municipalities of Seoul and its adjacent sub centres, there is a need to promote transit-oriented development (TOD) by creating high-density areas within close proximity to city railroad stations. In contrast, it is necessary, in municipalities on the outskirts of the SMA, to restrict large-scale developments, such as large retail centres, and instead promote a mixture of self-sufficient land uses. In the intermediate municipalities that lie between these two, TMS and ITR can be increased through TOD near railroad stations, or ITR alone can be increased through a greater mix of land use. These findings could assist in implementing effective compact-city planning policies in each municipality of the SMA, and could also be applied to the other metropolitan areas in Korea or elsewhere in the world.
Nursing	"Purpose: The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between healthcare needs, health-promoting behaviors and quality of life (QoL) of youths with congenital heart disease (CHD), and to determine whether health-promoting behaviors were a mediating variable. Design and methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted recruiting 205 youths aged 15 to 24 with either ventricular septa! defect (VSD) or tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect demographic information; furthermore, the thickness of the triceps skinfold was measured. The Healthcare Needs Scale for Youth with CHD, Adolescent Health Promotion-short form scale, and World Health Organization QoL-BREF scale were administered, and Pearson""s correlation, multiple regressions, and the Sobel test were conducted. Results: The triceps skinfold of participants with VSD was significantly thicker than that of participants with TOF (p < 0.05). Healthcare needs, health-promoting behaviors, and QoL were positively correlated. The overall health-promoting behaviors served as a partial mediator between overall healthcare needs and QoL, accounting for 40.1% of the total variation. Conclusions: The study illustrates that health-promoting behaviors have an impact on healthcare needs and QoL of youths with CHD. The development of tailored health consulting interventions to fulfill healthcare needs is required to improve physical and psychosocial wellness among youths with CHD. Practice implications: Targeting individual and public health strategies for enhancing health-promoting behaviors should be integrated in CHD care planning. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Business, Finance	We consider the valuation of European quanto call options in an incomplete market where the domestic and foreign forward interest rates are allowed to exhibit regime shifts under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework, and the foreign price dynamics is exogenously driven by a regime switching jump-diffusion model with Markov-modulated Poisson processes. We derive closed-form solutions for four different types of quanto call options, which include: options struck in a foreign currency, a foreign equity call struck in domestic currency, a foreign equity call option with a guaranteed exchange rate, and an equity-linked foreign exchange-rate call.

Sociology	Recent literature on social movements has called for a renewal of theory so that it engages more directly with the social and historical dynamics in which movements emerge and crystallize. Too often, some critics argue, movements are treated as static or reified phenomena that are disconnected from their links to space and time. I examine new social movement theory from an historical perspective that emphasizes its connections with concrete social dynamics at a given point in time. Unlike alternative approaches, new social movement (NSM) theory and in particular the work of Alain Touraine, was forged out of a specific episode of social conflict-the May 1968 revolt in France-and was deeply informed by the experience of this conflict. This theory provides a dynamic and relational model in which social and historical processes are treated as major determinants of collective action within society. Infact, what explains the success of NSM theory and its enduring influence over time, is that it reaches beyond an analysis of social movements to provide an overarching theory of society at a given historical juncture. The article suggests that NSM theory provides a fruitful perspective for scholars searching for an approach that take history into account.
International Relations	After the 1994 Rwandan genocide, solution and social reconciliation processes has started in this country. These processes are being conducted in terms of politics, economics, social psychology and law both in international and national levels. The most important and substantial contribution to the reconciliation process has taken place mainly from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Tribunal was established as an ad hoc Tribunal but its contributions to the social reconciliation and international law is permanent. The Tribunal has completed its twenty first year for now and as an ad hoc tribunal, its mission is going to be terminated at the end of 2015 after completing its proceedings. The Tribunal's mission was completed at December 31, 2015. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the ongoing cases will be assigned to national courts and to the newly established International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. This study presents the structure and completion strategy of the Tribunal and the contribution of it to the reconciliation processes of Rwanda. Then criticisms about the legal systems and social reconciliation are going to be discussed.
Rehabilitation	In the past 40years, prison populations in the U.S. have nearly quadrupled while funding for rehabilitation, education and other programmes has been cut. Despite accounting for a small fraction of the world's population more than 20% of the worlds incarcerated population is in the U.S. and the rate of recidivism remains alarmingly high. Occupational therapists have the capability to play a significant role in addressing the needs of persons within the criminal justice system. However, the profession has been slow to delineate of the role occupational therapy within criminal justice settings. This study sought to provide a descriptive analysis of current occupational therapy roles and practices within the U.S. criminal justice system. Using survey research methods, the researchers collected data from respondents (N=45; Response Rate+51.7%) to establish a baseline of the scope of practices employed by occupational therapists working in the U.S. criminal justice system. U.S. practitioners work within institutional and community based criminal justice settings. Primary practice models, assessments and group interventions were catalogued. Respondents strongly valued the creation of networking to build the professions' presence within criminal justice settings. Occupational therapy in the criminal justice system remains an emerging practice arena. Understanding the current scope of practice in the U.S. and creating a mechanism for collaboration may help increase the depth, breadth and overall growth of the profession's role in these settings. The sampling method does not guarantee a representative sample of the population and is limited to practice within the United States. Survey design may not have allowed for respondents to fully describe their practice experiences. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Communication	"The seminal 1983 ""Ferments in the Field"" collection made limited reference to environmental issues and concerns. Considering communication media and technological artifacts as both nature and culture and, more specifically, through defining media as both infrastructural environments and content, we discuss how challenges brought about by environmental change can inform contemporary media and communication research and environmental communication. The materiality of e-waste, which has resonance for cultural, political, economic, and geographic analyses, is used as an illuminating case in point. We link the implications ensuing from the e-waste issue with the roles mediation and communication of environmental narratives play, and how they can be informed by such ""medianatures,"" as well as geopolitical considerations."
Information Science & Library Science	The purpose of this study is to investigate whether diffusion through social media can help to improve the international visibility of Chinese papers and thus increase their citation impact. After analysing 160,233 Chinese papers published in 2012, as well as the number of tweets and citations received, the results indicate that tweeted Chinese papers published in the same year and journal received around 15% more citations than Chinese papers not mentioned on Twitter. The citation advantage of tweeted Chinese papers is also found within various disciplines and by the different citing countries.
Nursing	E-learning environments expand opportunities for the use of educational strategies that may contribute to the development of clinical reasoning in nursing students. The purposes of this scoping review were the following: 1) to map the principles of cognitive companionship and the theoretical foundations underlying the design and implementation of educational strategies used in e-learning environments for developing clinical reasoning in nursing students; and 2) to identify the types of educational strategies used in e-learning environments for developing or assessing clinical reasoning in nursing students. A scoping review was conducted and was based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Framework. Bibliographical databases were searched for studies published between January 2010 to July 2017. Out of 1202 screened articles, 18 met eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Principles of cognitive companionship in e-learning environments provide key clues from a learning support perspective, such as integrated feedback, interactive group discussion, gaming, and questioning. However, theoretical foundations underlying educational strategies in e-learning environments are poorly documented and insufficiently associated with cognitive learning models. E-learning environments must have solid theoretical foundations to provide support for the development of CR in nursing students.
International Relations	About half of the nations that experience civil war eventually relapse into renewed conflict within a few years after the original war ends. This observation has motivated a stream of research into the factors that affect the risk of peace failure in the aftermath of civil war. While the outcome of the previous civil warfor example, military victory versus peace agreementstructures the post-war environment in ways that affect the risk of peace failure, the capacity of the post-war state to enact and implement policies that affect the incentives for and capacity of groups to undertake armed violence as a means of advancing their interests should also affect the risks of peace failure. Using Geddes' categories of nondemocratic regime types, we will present a theory of how different regime types have varying capacities to repress and/or implement accommodative policies that affect the risk of peace failure. We test propositions derived from this theory with a series of event history models. Our findings suggest that while peace agreements significantly increase the duration of post-civil war peace, peace agreements involving some types of nondemocratic regimes actually increase the risk of post-civil war peace failure.
International Relations	Coup-proofing pertains to political leaders' strategies that will prevent groups inside or outside the state apparatus from seizing power via a coup d'etat. One particular form of these strategies divides a country's military into rivaling organizations, thereby creating an artificial balance between and structural obstacles for the armed forces. Despite the general claim that this institutional coup-proofing is indeed effective, a recent empirical study does not obtain evidence for a negative impact on the risk of coup attempts or coup outcomes. The authors take this finding as a motivation for their re-evaluation of the effect of institutional coup-proofing on coup risk and outcomes. By developing an argument that rests on the concepts of collective action and polarization, it is contended that institutional coup-proofing and coups are characterized by a U-shaped relationship: Institutional coup-proofing is likely to lower the likelihood of coup onsets and successful outcomes, yet only until a tipping point of about two equally strong military organizations. After this turning point, the risk of coup onset as well as coup success may increase again. Using time-series cross-section data for 1975-1999, the authors find strong and robust support for their claims in terms of coup onset, but not coup outcomes.
Cultural Studies	This article focuses on Cuban exile artist Ana Mendieta's early 1970s performances, which are often relegated to a cursory status in her oeuvre and sometimes dismissed as inconsequential juvenilia. Instead, I argue that these mark the beginning of Mendieta's elaborate and complex engagement with racialized and gendered difference through the unsettling aesthetic force of her abject performances. I decenter focus on her well-known Silueta Series (1973-1980) by linking her early performances to the curatorial work bookending her more-recognized earthwork, offering a frame by which to revise critical interpretations of these. By focusing on abjection as a politicized aesthetic strategy I situate Mendieta squarely within a genealogy of women of color feminisms and queer of color critique, an epistemological project that enlivens the political import of Mendieta's avant-gardism. Ultimately, her recourse to the abject brings into focus analogous and shared relations to dominance by minoritized subjects beyond Cuban or even Latino particularity, allowing us to think expansively about Mendieta's contributions specifically to the field of Latino Studies.
Area Studies	Erenak Bek was the third son of eminent Kyrgyz ruler Isey Mergen, grandson of Nomcu Bek and the ruler of Altisar nation, which established Kyrgyz state in Yenisey. According to written sourcess he was descended from an important Kyrgyz lineage. Obviously, Erenak Bek was the ruler who united Siberian Kyrgyz in second period of 17th century. Therefore, it is possible to say that Erenak Bek, who is the ruler of Siberian Kyrgyz, put Kyrgyz and their Kistims (depended tribes) to gather under a state with the political support of the Cungar Khan Senge-Tays and then the Galdan Bosoktu Han, who was on the throne and organized significant activities against the Russians and provides benefits from them.
Cultural Studies	Using the methods of textual analysis and in conversation with both Latin American cultural studies and queer studies, the essay examines the ways that Pedro Lemebel's diverse body of work - ranging from live performances, fiction, non-fictional cronicas, and interviews - engages the limits of subversion in neoliberal times. On the one hand, Lemebel's work has been routinely framed in terms of its subversion of gendered, sexual, and political norms. On the other hand, scholars and commentators have not deeply engaged the many ways that Lemebel's own work comments on and represents the challenges of producing subversive cultural productions in a globalized, late capitalist environment in which subversion, including his own, can be undone precisely when it is most celebrated, valued, and commodified. Reading Lemebel's commentaries and interviews as producing cultural criticism that complements his better-known cronicas' and performances' ideological narratives, the essay argues that Lemebel's oeuvre repeatedly addresses the challenges of performing a delicate dance between resistance and co-optation, given his acknowledged inseparability from the market. Taking Lemebel as a model for this balancing act, the essay ultimately aims to reveal and critique some of the ways that we academics tend to read sexual dissidence as successful subversion without recognizing its complications and limits.
Education, Special	Students with mild to moderate disabilities, English language learners, and other at-risk groups frequently struggle academically in general education science and social studies classrooms. In this article, the research surrounding preteaching as an academic intervention for content area instruction is reviewed. General suggestions for preteaching science and social studies content to students from upper elementary to high school levels are given based on the theoretical and empirical literature. Subsequently, suggestions for implementing three types of preteaching are described in detail: vocabulary preteaching, preteaching with advance organizers, and preteaching targeting background knowledge. Conclusions are drawn regarding the utility of preteaching and the need for further research investigating preteaching interventions.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The social implications of recent developments In the life sciences have widely been theorized In terms of 'biological citizenship'; a notion that suggests that claims on collective resources are Increasingly brought forward by groups of Individuals organized around shared molecular biological characteristics, outside of traditional Institutional formations centered on the state. In this paper, I propose to amend this notion by situating biological citizenship In Its specific context of emergence. I suggest that the notion of molecular biological citizenship from below, with Its focus on Individual responsibility for disease risks, was In part facilitated by the development of Ideas of Individual responsibility for phenotypic 'risk factors' In the government-funded Framingham Heart Study In the United States. I reconstruct how the federal government retreated from direct operational responsibility for the Study, defined and maintained the boundaries of the population and contributed particular risk-based notions of life over more than six decades of cardiovascular disease research. I suggest that government, population, and life as defined In the Study are Indispensable for contemporary notions of biological citizenship and that analysts need to attend to these situated origins In order to productively understand biological citizenship In relation to wider transformations of citizenship at present.
Business, Finance	One of the main difficulties in evaluating the profits obtained using technical analysis is that performance of trading rules depends upon the judicious choice of rule parameters. In this paper, popular moving-average (or cross-over) rules are applied to a cross-section of Australian stocks and the signals from the rules are used to form portfolios. The performance of the trading rules across the full range of possible parameter values is evaluated by means of an aggregate test that does not depend on the parameters of the rules. The results indicate that for a wide range of parameters moving-average rules generate contrarian profits (profits from the moving-average rules are negative). In bootstrap simulations the return statistics are significant indicating that the moving-average rules pick up some form of systematic variation in returns that does not correlate with the standard risk factors.

Rehabilitation	Social effectiveness is central to workplace success. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the factors that influence effectiveness in managing the social requirements of the workplace. This study provides a preliminary analysis of a model of workplace social effectiveness for adults with disabilities. A total of 330 adults with disabilities participated in an online, cross-sectional research study. Researchers used several measures to assess the extent to which latent variables representing communal and positive approaches to social situations influenced workplace social effectiveness and whether that relationship was mediated by the ability to connect with others. Results from a structural equation model analysis suggest that both a communal and positive social approach predict workplace social effectiveness. The ability to connect with others partially mediated relationships between both communal and positive approaches and workplace social effectiveness. Although the cross-sectional and self-report nature of this study limits the conclusions that can be drawn, the findings lay a groundwork for further model testing and clinical interventions in rehabilitation counseling services. The results offer an alternative socioemotional approach for identifying and intervening on workplace social effectiveness that can be applied to adults with disabilities.
Law	This is a challenging moment for the law of discrimination. The state's role in discrimination has largely shifted from requiring discrimination - through official policies such as segregation - to prohibiting discrimination - through federal laws covering areas such as employment, housing, education, and public accommodations. Yet the problem of discrimination persists, often in forms that are hard to regulate or even to recognize. At this challenging moment, the intimate domain presents a vital terrain for study in two main ways. First, conceptually, studying the intimate domain permits new insights into discrimination and the law's identity categories, because people are more willing to be explicit about identity-based preferences in this domain than in others (such as employment). Second, practically, examining the intimate domain reveals the ways that relationships in this sphere affect hierarchies and opportunities in more public domains, and the role the state plays in those relationships. This Article therefore examines intimate discrimination, focusing on race, sex, and disability, and identifies key norms for each category. For race, the norm is homogamy, or pairing with one's own type; for sex, by contrast, the norm is heterogamy, pairing outside one's type; and for disability, the norm. is desexualization, rather than pairing with one group or another. The Article does not assume that intimate discrimination is necessarily bad. On the contrary, examining the nuanced landscape of discrimination in this realm is one of the Article's main purposes. Ultimately, the Article concludes that, at the level of individual interaction, intimate differentiation based on these identity traits can be good, bad, or neutral, depending on context. For this and other reasons, legal regulation targeting individual differentiation on these bases would be woefully misguided. Nonetheless, the state plays important roles in intimate discrimination at a structural level. By creating the infrastructure of society, the state shapes the accidents of who meets whom and how. In addition, the state plays a role in the hierarchy of intimate opportunities by shaping social capital and relative advantages. The state therefore should reform its laws and policies to attend to its structural role in intimate discrimination. For sex, the most obvious next step is to cease to restrict marriage according to sex. For disability, the state should help to encourage opportunities for intimate affiliation by, among other things, attending to the architecture of intimacy, by which I mean the ways that structures of accommodation operate to help or hinder not only access, but also closeness. For race, the state's goal should not be to encourage race mixing, but rather to lift burdens on existing relationships, such as residential segregation. Recognizing how intimate affiliations affect opportunities and status hierarchies, both in the intimate sphere and beyond, points us toward new ways to intervene in the persistent problem of discrimination.
Business, Finance	Most option pricing models assume all parameters except volatility are fixed; yet they almost invariably change on re-calibration. This article explains how to capture the model risk that arises when parameters that are assumed constant have calibrated values that change over time and how to use this model risk to adjust the price hedge ratios of the model. Empirical results demonstrate all improvement in hedging performance after the model risk adjustment. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 29:1021-1049, 2009
Education, Special	We compared the effectiveness of and preference for different feedback strategies when training six special education teachers during a 5-day summer training program. In Experiment 1, teachers received written or vocal feedback while learning to implement two different types of preference assessments. In Experiment 2, we compared either written or vocal feedback to vocal feedback combined with video replays of performance while training the teachers to implement two variations of discrete-trial training. The different forms of feedback were similarly effective for all of the participants. However, all of the teachers showed a preference for vocal feedback when they could choose which form of feedback they would receive from the experimenter. Results have important implications for the use of feedback when training teachers.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Christopher Boorse's Bio Statistical Theory (BST) defines health as the absence of disease, and disease as the adverse departure from normal species functioning. This paper presents a two-pronged problem for this account. First I demonstrate that, in order to accurately account for dynamic physiological functions, Boorse's account of normal function needs to be modified to index functions against situations. I then demonstrate that if functions are indexed against situations, the BST can no longer account for diseases that result from specific environmental factors. The BST is impaled on either horn of this dilemma and therefore must be dismissed.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	A qualitative case study approach was used to explore the phenomenon of intercultural interactions among different roles in the Earthwatch Institute's 'Chinese Village Traditions' project, conducted in Shaanxi, China, in 2008. On-site observation, in-depth interviews, and related documentation were utilized to explore guest-host relations. The study investigated the perceptions and experiences of the 4 principal investigators, 4 student helpers, 10 international volunteer tourists, 5 domestic volunteer tourists, and 3 members of the host family. The results showed some linkages among the expectations, motivations, and intercultural interaction experiences of the different roles. The findings provide a first look at the intercultural interactions among different roles within an international volunteer tourist project in China, offering an insight into a neglected field.
Women'S Studies	This article revisits a much-debated question: Why are women popular targets during witch hunts? By using in-depth interviews this article provides an answer. Women are easy targets or scapegoats for two reasons. First, it is widely believed in the community that was studied that witches do, in fact, exist, and the images of witches are always female. Second, tribal women hold lower positions than men in all social, political, and ritual matters, and this contributes to their vulnerability during the hunt for scapegoats. This article also highlights the roles that rumors play during manipulation of witchcraft accusations to gather support for witch hunts.
Information Science & Library Science	Over five decades, Information Technology and Libraries (and its predecessor, the Journal of Library Automation) has influenced research and practice in the library and information science technology. From its inception on, the journal has been consistently ranked as one of the superior publications in the profession and a trendsetter for all types of librarians and researchers. This research examines ITAL using a citation analysis of all 878 peer-reviewed feature articles published over the journal's 51 volumes. Impactful authors, articles, publications, and themes from the journal's history are identified. The findings of this study provide insight into the history of ITAL and potential topics of interest to ITAL authors and readership.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Increasing ethnic diversity in the Australian workforce has attracted the attention of both hoteliers and academics, raising awareness of the need to better understand how to manage an ethnically diverse workforce effectively. The current study investigated the views and practices of managers responsible for an ethnically diverse workforce in order to explore the nature of identity-conscious and identity-blind management structures currently operating in Australian medium-sized hotels. Using semi-structured interviews with 27 hotel general managers nationally across Australia, the study examined the human resource management strategies that the participants have adopted for dealing with diversity. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and it can be argued from the findings that hotel managers often use informal identity-conscious practices to deal with ethnically diverse employees. The paper emphasizes the need to formalize these informal identity-conscious practices and offers suggestions for how hotels may benefit in the long term.

History Of Social Sciences	Following rapid urban growth over the past four decades, informal settlements originally located in peripheral areas of large Latin American cities are now occupying increasingly valuable land in the central city. As a result, these communities are facing intense redevelopment pressures with important implications for housing accessibility. Although this situation is common in the region, central city redevelopment assumes a variety of forms depending on shifting approaches to land titling under different urban governance regimes, resulting in variegated, formal, and informal land markets. This comparative historical case study of Bogota, Colombia, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, suggests that urban redevelopment planning has drawn on two contrasting discourses of property rights: one privileging private market approaches based in the economic theory of Libertarianism; the other favouring state authority and redistribution building on the ethics of Utilitarianism. In both Bogota and Buenos Aires, however, de facto land-titling policies have shifted between the principles of Libertarianism and Utilitarianism under different political regimes, and neither market- nor state-oriented approaches have served to safeguard low-income residents' access to housing. Instead, the shifting influence of each discourse has structured formal and informal land markets in ways that complicate long-standing debates surrounding land titling in informal settlements.
Information Science & Library Science	"The study aims to assess journals' structural influence in Internet research and uncover the impacts of network structures on journals' structural influence drawing on theories of network closure and structural holes. The data of the study are the citation exchanges among 1,210 journals in Communication and other seven social scientific fields (i.e., Business, Economics/Finance, Education, Information Science, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology) in Internet research. The top two most influential journals in Internet research are American Economic Review and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Journals in ""Communication"" field emerge to be an important source of influence in Internet research, whose mean structural influence ranks third among the eight fields, below ""Business"" and ""Economics/Finance"", but above other five fields. Journals' structural influences are found to grow over time and the growth rates vary across journals. Network brokerage is found to exert a significant impact on journals' structural influence, while the impact of network closure on journals' structural influences is not significant. The impact of network brokerage on journals' structural influence will increase over time."
Business	A systematic literature review of the articles published in the Journal of Business Research and other organization and management theory (OMT) journals reveals a substantial increase in the number of studies on heuristics. Anticipating the emerging influence of heuristics for OMT, we review the basic principles and the state of the art of its current application. We find that scholars have verified the applicability and value of individual heuristics in management on an individual level. However, scholars lack a detailed understanding of the role of heuristics in organizations. A distinct organization-level perspective on heuristics would contribute to an understanding of organizations as antecedents, subjects, and consequences of heuristics. The study here presents this potential together with a research agenda for heuristics and organizational processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Communication	The lack of effective communication about climate risk has contributed to improper interpretation of scientific findings pertaining to climate change and to poor mobilization of vulnerable groups for developing appropriate response actions. This article describes communication efforts undertaken in Ghana, India, Malawi, and Mongolia to develop and implement climate risk communication strategies that emphasize collective knowledge generation between researchers and stakeholders. The studies underscored the critical importance of presenting complex information in locally relevant terms to facilitate shared understanding of climate risk issues and that knowledge co-generation and social learning between researchers and communities are key to developing context-appropriate risk communication approaches.
Urban Studies	Taxi is a core component of urban transit systems. Since they can provide more time-saving and convenient service than many other transit options, taxis have a certain passenger base. The analysis of taxi ridership can be used to better understand the travel mobility of passengers and the traffic structure of urban areas. In previous studies, taxi trajectory data have been widely used, especially in exploring taxi ridership, and point-of-interest (POI) data are usually used to evaluate the land-use type of a certain sub-district. On the basis of preceding research, this paper uses taxi trajectory data within the long time scale of one week. Five traffic factors are taken into consideration: pick-ups, drop-offs, and the ratio of pick-ups to drop-offs, pick-up probability and drop-off probability. The research model is divided into weekdays and weekends. For the calculation of probabilities, an index termed the Area Crossing Index is proposed to reflect the taxi cardinality and accessibility of a region. At the same time, POI and demographic data are used as explanatory variables. In this study, we also take the business hours of POIs into consideration. In order to explore the ridership in each hour, hierarchical clustering is used to determine the similarity characteristics of hourly dependent variables. Then, stepwise linear regression is used to screen and evaluate coefficients without collinearity. Finally, geographically weighted regression is adopted to evaluate spatial variability, and the coefficients of common explanatory variables on weekdays and weekends are examined. At the end of this paper, the causes of common explanatory factors on weekdays and weekends for each traffic factor are discussed. This paper also analyzes ridership by combining all the results of dependent variables and proposes some suggestions for taxi scheduling.
Transportation	The logistics environment between China and Korea has been changing rapidly in line with the 'Go West' policy of international trade and logistics area. The policy includes the BRI, Western Development Strategy, and Korea-China FTA. Against this background, the Korea-China train ferry (KCTF) is being newly illuminated as an alternative mode to cope with the logistics environment between Korea and China. One of the key success factors of the KCTF depends on, among others, shippers' perception, which will affect the choice and the successful operation of the KCTF. From this perspective, this paper develops seven hypotheses based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We test these hypotheses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to explore the structural relationship between shippers' behavioral beliefs influencing the perceived usefulness, the attitude toward and intention to choose the KCTF. The test results confirm that among the behavioral beliefs, transport accessibility in association with an efficient network of inland roads and railway networks is an important prerequisite. In addition, we verified a high statistical significance in the structural relationships among perceived usefulness, the attitude toward and the intention to choose the KCTF.
Economics	India has pursued an active food security policy for many years by using a combination of trade policy interventions, public distribution of food staples, and assistance to farmers through minimum support prices defended by public stocks. This approach has been quite successful in stabilizing staple food prices, but comes at a high cost, and with potential risks of unmanageable stock accumulation. Based on a rational expectations storage model representing the Indian wheat market and its relation to the rest of the world, we analyse the cost and welfare implications of this policy, and unpack the contribution of its various elements. To analyse alternative policies, we assume that social welfare includes an objective of price stabilization and assess optimal policies corresponding to this objective. We consider fully optimal policies under commitment as well as optimal simple rules, and show that adopting simple rules can achieve most of the gains from fully optimal policies.
Education & Educational Research	Professional learning communities (PLC's) are increasingly used to enhance professional development of teachers and school improvement. This assumes that teachers experience professional space in their schools. This article therefore used semi-structured interviews to reveal how 18 teachers perceived their professional space for professional development and school improvement. During the interviews, the extent, nature and focus of professional space are explored. In general, the results show that teachers perceive less professional space for school improvement. On the other hand, teachers experience professional space for their own professional development of for both professional development and school improvement. Five categories of experienced professional space are identified: 1) stronger experienced professional space for professional development than for school improvement (stable), 2) strong experienced professional space for both professional development and school improvement (stable), 3) strong experienced professional space for professional development, decline for school improvement (dynamic), 4) to a limited extent experienced professional space for both professional development and school improvement (stable) and 5) increased experienced professional space for professional development and school improvement (dynamic). Their sense of professional space seems to be more stable than dynamic during the school year. Finally, the sense of professional space is a result of an interplay between personal features (for example intentions) and contextual features (for example subject teams and leadership in schools).
Rehabilitation	Using data from the Current Population Survey, the authors studied self-employment among people with work limitations in the United States. They found that self-employment rates are higher among workers with limitations compared with workers without limitations. Furthermore, the self-employment differential increases with education and age. This investigation of possible explanations has revealed that expected wage differences between self-employed people and employees are similar between disability groups but average work hours are lower and more variable among the self-employed with work limitations. This evidence is consistent with the view that people with disabilities might choose self-employment because of non-monetary motives.
Management	This paper examines the effect of reference prices on companies operating within competitive industries. We confirm that even with competition, firms optimally price high in the short term to generate a high reference price and then decrease this price over time. Competitors' prices converge toward each other over time, emphasizing the short-term nature of reference prices. We then show that pricing optimally to take advantage of reference prices generates a positive externality for other firms in an industry, such that competitors may generate higher profit. The longer the focus of a given firm, the more profit the firm generates, but less relative to its competitors. This arises because the externalities created through pricing high to increase reference prices outweigh the benefits of the higher reference prices themselves. If pricing managers are compensated relative to their competition, this suggests that short-termism may be implicitly encouraged to the detriment of profit.
Rehabilitation	Resilience has long been a topic of study in various fields, and in recent decades many researchers and clinicians have focused on the literature dealing with family resilience, specifically the resilience of parents with children who have suffered a trauma. Inspired by empirical and theoretical studies on resilience, health care professionals working with families are increasingly trying to develop interventions that could facilitate or support family resilience. This article critically analyses the knowledge currently available in this field by first examining the literature on family resilience in the context of physical traumas and then research studies focused on interventions that foster family resilience.
Geography	"The narrative of environmental justice is powerfully and passionately advocated by researchers, practitioners and activists across scale and space. Yet, because these struggles are multifaceted and pluralistic, rooted in complex, evolving ""socio-material-political interminglings"" the concept is difficult to grasp, and even harder to realise. Recent literature raises concerns as to what makes for environmental injustices, how injustices are defined, classified as urgent and/or critical, by whom and why, how they gain political attention, etc. This paper draws attention to these issues by contrasting the largely untold, nonetheless entrenched and enduring ""old"" water supply injustices in the Darjeeling region of the Eastern Himalaya in India with articulate contestations relating to the speedy advancement of ""new"" hydropower projects here. Water supply problems in the Darjeeling region are particularly wicked nested in fractious ethnicity-identity political conflicts. These complex local realities tend to obscure the everyday challenges relating to water as well as render these problems spatially anecdotal. What happens - or does not - around water here is certainly unique, yet comparison to other struggles in other settings show that locational and environmental politics provide critical evidence to question the several implicit universalisms in relation to water justice.

Area Studies	"In this article I draw examples from the broader terrain of academic and popular literature, news media, television, and film to explore questions regarding representations of Samoans, and especially Samoan men, in the United States. The mediated accessibility of Samoans, via televised sports and entertainment, combines with their relative geographic and demographic inaccessibility to produce popular images of a population that the vast majority of Americans know very little about. Such representations are gendered in particular ways, such that the archetypal Samoan body in US popular discourse is now masculine, rather than feminine. I discuss how popular representations of Samoan men may be similar to representations of black men the latter so central to discourses of race in the United States as well as how are they different, particularly in light of the discursively slippery histories of representing Pacific peoples as both noble and ignoble ""savages."" The main narrative component of discourses about Samoan men, body size, is critically engaged; additionally, the article argues that the added element of (indigenous) culture thought to be outside or anterior to Western modernity grant to Samoans an exoticness not normally granted to black Americans. This essay attempts to expose, engage, and examine these active processes of representation and myth creation what visual theorist Clyde Taylor might term mythogenesis to better understand the discursive terrain that Samoans negotiate, often ambivalently, in the United States."
Ethics	The present article investigates what empirical research can add to family ethics. The author discusses the approach of theologian Don Browning's family ethics, referring to empirical research about values and norms and about factual data. The author warns against oversimplifying the relationship between what 'is' and what 'ought' to be. In the next step, the author critically examines her previous research in light of the meta-question of the relevance of empirical research for ethics. Four aspects are discussed: empirical research as a possible bridge between ideals and reality, empirical results on the gender related division of domestic tasks, experiences of family in relation to ethical ideas and the relationship between ethical views on family life and religious attitudes. Empirical research is considered relevant for theological family ethics because it makes researchers aware of the distance or similarities between ideals and reality, because it helps them to reflect on the relevance of their theological ethics in practice and because it demonstrates the influence of social, religious and family identity on ethical thinking.
Anthropology	Newly discovered prehistoric sites in the Seimarreh Valley in Iran provide the first evidence for Palaeolithic human habitation in this region of the Central Zagros.
History & Philosophy Of Science	If ecological systems are functionally organised, they can possess functions or malfunctions. Natural function would provide justification for conservationists to act for the protection of current ecological arrangements and control the presence of populations that create ecosystem malfunctions. Invasive species are often thought to be malfunctional for ecosystems, so functional arrangement would provide an objective reason for their control. Unfortunately for this prospect, I argue no theory of function, which can support such normative conclusions, can be applied to large scale ecosystems. Instead ecological systems have causal structure, with small clusters of populations achieving functional arrangement. This, however, does not leave us without reason to control invasive species. We can look at the causal arrangement of ecological systems for populations that support ecological features that we should preserve. Populations that play a causal role in reducing biodiversity should be controlled, because biodiversity is a good all prudent agents should want to preserve.
Cultural Studies	This paper examines the limits and possibilities of topological approaches in the social analysis of technology. It proposes that topology should be considered not just as a theory to be adopted, but equally as a device that is deployed in social life in a variety of ways. Digital technologies help to make clear why: these technologies have facilitated the spread of a topological imagination, but they have also enabled a weak form of topological imagination, one that leaves in place deterministic ideas about technology as the principal driver of social change. This paper examines this situation and alternatives to it through an empirical case, that of smart electricity meters. On the one hand, these technologies enable only a limited 'expansion of the frame' on technology, one in which the primacy of technology is maintained. But they are also used to render relations between technology and society more complexly. I explore topological devices deployed in this second way, such as the digital visualization tool of tag clouding and propose that this device enables an empirical mode of critique: here, topology does not just help to foreground the entanglement of the social and the technical, it also helps to dramatize the contingent, non-coherent unfolding of issues.
Education & Educational Research	What does it take to sustain a productive partnership between a public school system and local cultural institutions? This article describes the genesis, evolution, and continued success of a long-term partnership between the New York City Department of Education, the American Museum of Natural History, and seven other leading cultural institutions, promoting inquiry-based science instruction in local middle schools.
Criminology & Penology	Prior research has failed to attend adequately to the ways in which state-level political actors in the USA think about and relate to public opinion. While some research has considered how political actors, such as legislators and state agency staff members, assess public opinion on penal issues, that body of research has been limited both conceptually and methodologically. This article argues that an enterprise perspective on policy making combined with a constructionist perspective on public opinion have the potential to deepen our understanding of penal policy making. To that end, descriptive data from interviews with a wide range of political actors in New York State are considered for what they indicate about the dynamics of public opinion construction, assessment, and use among political actors engaged in penal policy making.
Family Studies	This paper reviews the research on a largely hidden issue: The ways in which a history of child sexual abuse (CSA) can influence men's perceptions and experience of fatherhood. Although no research that specifically investigated this topic was found, the current review identified a small number of qualitative studies involving male victim/survivors of CSA in which the area of fatherhood was covered. Key themes, such as male victim/survivors' fears that they may abuse their children or their tendency to be overprotective parents, are discussed with reference to relevant sociological, psychological and gender theory. Also discussed are the contemporary social and political contexts that shape the ways in which gender and sexual violence are understood and constructed, and which in turn contribute to this issue remaining excluded from public, academic and policy discourses. Finally, future research directions are outlined.
Urban Studies	"This paper aims to answer the following research question: does the knowledge city environment stimulate entrepreneurship? To answer this question, we develop a framework and multidimensional indexes to better explain the different dimensions of a ""knowledge city"" and their relation to urban entrepreneurship, defined in terms of new and digital ventures. The analysis was performed on a sample of 60 cities, including all capital cities in the EU28 and 32 non-capital cities in the EU that are considered important knowledge hubs. The presence of cities from EU28 countries is important to foster the entrepreneurship attitude in each national context. Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing a new approach to understand the factors affecting knowledge cities and to identify the city profiles that are key for the development of urban-level entrepreneurship, thus providing a number of important insights for academics and urban policy makers."
Social Issues	Retrofit is a rising area of concern for Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars of infrastructure. This paper sits at the junction between applied and theoretical approaches by using STS to support interventions in urban infrastructure systems and expand STS critique of retrofit. It discusses findings from a multidisciplinary project piloting retrofit possibilities to positively impact the way water, energy, and food resources were consumed in a London housing estate. Through qualitative research, we found that residents were making social and material interventions in infrastructure systems to manage the way resources were consumed at home, driven by a commonly held motivation to avoid wastefulness. We then mapped the social and material factors that helped or hindered these individual ambitions and used them to inform our codesign process. We found it helpful to think of the residents as an infrastructural community; a group of residents that share a material connection that can help mobilize collective action on shared consumption. We suggest this concept is useful for interventions and critiques of infrastructure retrofit, particularly in cities in the Global North where retrofit programs aim to rescale national systems to neighborhood levels. The concept highlights the possibilities for participation that emerge from bottom-up retrofit.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Panel data make it possible both to control for unobserved confounders and to include lagged, endogenous regressors. However, trying to do both simultaneously leads to serious estimation difficulties. In the econometric literature, these problems have been addressed by using lagged instrumental variables together with the generalized method of moments, while in sociology the same problems have been dealt with using maximum likelihood estimation and structural equation modeling. While both approaches have merit, we show that the maximum likelihood structural equation models method is substantially more efficient than the generalized method of moments method when the normality assumption is met and that the former also suffers less from finite sample biases. We introduce the command xtdpdml, which has syntax similar to other Stata commands for linear dynamic panel-data estimation. xtdpdml greatly simplifies the structural equation model specification process; makes it possible to test and relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in dynamic panel models; allows one to include time-invariant variables in the model, unlike most related methods; and takes advantage of Stata's ability to use full-information maximum likelihood for dealing with missing data. The strengths and advantages of xtdpdml are illustrated via examples from both economics and sociology.
Transportation	This work examines combined vehicle and crew scheduling in public bus transit in the context of both robust and cost-efficient resource allocation. Cost-efficiency in terms of minimal planned costs for resource usage is already addressed in numerous contributions providing increasingly sophisticated optimization approaches that are able to compute highly efficient resource schedules. Unfortunately, during operations the resulting tight resource schedules are generally more susceptible to disruptions causing delays or even cascades of delays. Because of dependencies between scheduled vehicles and drivers, even small delays may propagate through the entire network. However, to date there is only little research assessing schedule robustness against disruptions and delays, affecting both vehicle and crew schedules. We consider the mutual dependencies between vehicle and crew schedules and propose solution approaches that are able to consider the propagation of possible delays. The approaches are used to create cost-efficient resource schedules simultaneously capable to absorb delays and to prevent delay propagation. In particular, we present a fully integrated vehicle and crew scheduling approach. To analyze problem characteristics we investigate to what extent sequential, partially integrated, and integrated vehicle and crew scheduling lead to schedules with different quality. Numerical experiments using real-world problem instances examine the influence of these different scheduling schemes on robustness and cost-efficiency. The results stress the relevance of incorporating possible delay propagation when scheduling resources in (especially urban) public transportation. Compared to pure cost-efficient scheduling, the expected delay propagation can be decreased drastically without additional costs.
History	This article. asks how Vichy sought to defend French sovereignty against Italian threats across those unoccupied areas of France and its colonial empire which were covered by the Italian armistice between June 1940 and November 1942. It suggests that, while Vichy's response to German violations of French sovereignty was limited by its policy of collaboration, no such constraints were in place when it came to Italian interventions. Despite this, however, the defence of French sovereignty against Italian threats was not a straightforward story of defiance. Opposing Italian actions in one policy domain in one territory had to be weighed against the potential repercussions in another policy domain in another territory It also had to be calibrated with the implications for French relations with Berlin. The Italian dimension to Vichy's actions therefore suggests that the biggest challenge in negotiations was not Vichy's desire to defend its sovereign status so much as the lure of collaboration.
Development Studies	This paper tests the PPP hypothesis for the South African rand/US dollar real exchange rate using a fractional integration framework. The results suggest that the real exchange rate of the South African rand with respect to the US dollar is a highly dependent variable with an order of integration very close to 1. This finding is not affected by the data frequency considered (daily, weekly or monthly). Also, there appears to be a single break in December 2001 (possibly corresponding to a change in the monetary policy framework), with the unit root null being rejected in favour of d > 1 for the periods before the break, but not afterwards. Thus, our results strongly reject the PPP hypothesis for the South African rand/US dollar rate across data frequencies, since shocks are found to affect the exchange rate forever.
Ethics	"In this article I look at the methodology of one the most unique figures in Russian philosophy-Merab Mamardavili-who was known for his focus on consciousness. According to him, the application of the subject-object dualism to the analysis of consciousness leads to a series of complications. Within the phenomenological framework of intentionality there is an interwining of perspective and object to which this perspective is directed. As soon as we try to apply to consciousness subject-object schemes, then we immediately come across paradoxes. It is impossible to determine consciousness by means of subject-object, not only because it is neither an object nor a subject, but also because consciousness inevitably turns out to be ""prior"" to such distinctions."
Education & Educational Research	Education supervision plays an important role in developing qualified human resources. However, sudden changes in Turkish education policies have affected the supervision system. A reorganization took place in the education supervision system in 2014, whereby provincial education supervisors (PES) and national education supervisors (NES) became unified under the Provincial National Education Directorates (NED). This unification created significant problems, particularly in respect to both status and employee rights. The present research aims to reveal the views of the education supervisors on the unification of these two groups. In this study, a qualitative research method and phenomenological design were used. The study group consists of education supervisors (8 NESs and 7 PESs) working in Ankara Provincial NED. Data collected in 2014-2015 academic term, using a semi structured interview technique, was analyzed by the content analysis method. According to the findings, the participants described the purposes of this unification as: eliminating duplication of duties, creating independent and qualified supervision, centrally consolidating supervisions, opening the supervision to political influences, and improving employee rights. On the other hand, while unification has had some positive effects on the supervisors in terms of in collaboration and knowing each other closely, it has also adversely affected the education system in areas such as lack of supervision, professional exhaustion, financial expectations, loss of status, and biased supervision. As an alternative to unification, the participants recommend unifying under a region, the ministry or a governorship. The current unification, contrary to its intended purposes of education and learning quality, has rather led to problems of status and employee rights, as well as discussions on such problems. As a result of such discussions, a dual system was put into effect that was organized at a central level and a provincial level, similarly to before the unification.

Criminology & Penology	Edgework can be a useful heuristic tool in producing counter-statements about Orthodox Criminology, where the measurable has arguably become more important than the meaningful. This paper focuses on the embodied experiential nexus of culture and crime in which criminology is taught, administered, and investigated. The Burkean framework of Dramatism is used to reveal how collective creative productions by students can provide insight into the political context of the contemporary criminology classroom. Through an analysis of instant ethnographies penned by participants of a flash mob I illustrate how the role of autonomy and responsibility are not resources that students readily draw upon to understand themselves in relation to the production of knowledge and social change. These observations support some of the concerns raised by Cultural Criminologist about the rise of administrative criminology. In the spirit of detournement, I argue that one way to facilitate student engagement with knowledge production differently is to invite them to experience moments of embodied transgressions.
Gerontology	The representation of social groups in advertising has been a major concern in academia. However, research focusing on older people has been scant and mainly conducted in Western countries. In Japan, the country that has been most affected by demographic change, this research area has received little attention. Through a content analysis of a systematic sample of 2,972 television advertisements broadcast on the five major commercial television stations in Japan in 1997 and 2007, this paper tries to fill this research gap, examining changes in the representation of older people in Japanese television advertising. When comparing 2007 to 1997, we found that older people appeared more often, were increasingly alone and in major roles, and were portrayed in more favourable ways, which suggests that their status changed. These changes appear to be related to the fact that older people have become more important within Japanese society. However, some aspects have remained unchanged; older people continue to be under-represented, which does not reflect demographic reality, and are used in advertisements for foods and beverages, confirming findings from previous studies. Our findings indicate that the representation of older people in Japanese television advertising has changed but remains unrealistic.
History Of Social Sciences	A key feature of modern planning history has been the identification of cities admired for their good planning'. In varying degrees, they have stimulated emulation, selective or partial borrowing, or even direct copying of their admired planning features. Model cities at different phases of planning history include Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Moscow, London, Stockholm, Barcelona, Chicago, New York, Portland and Vancouver. In recent years, new models have emerged, such as Singapore or Curitiba. The article considers how such cities became or are becoming models. It examines the methods by which the knowledge and reputation of the model' are promoted and disseminated. The importance of key actors, and visits, conferences and exhibitions focused on planning issues are considered. So too are less specific factors which help draw the gaze of a wider world. The article also considers whether such cities were/are places where new planning approaches have been invented or where they were implemented on a larger scale. Overall the paper discusses a key and strengthening feature in the circulation of contemporary planning knowledge. It does not answer all the surrounding questions in any definitive sense but opens up new debates about planning and the processes behind its historical evolution.
Development Studies	This article examines the content of a web-based repository of published international development impact evaluations created by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) in 2012. In 2015, the authors of this article along with a team of reviewers at 3ie used an updated search and screening protocol to identify new impact evaluation studies published until September 2015. By using systematic search and screening techniques to populate the repository, which contains 4,205 development impact evaluations published between 1981 and September 2015, we can use the data to analyse the trends in impact evaluation research. Though we find early evidence of a plateau in the growth rate of development impact evaluations, the number of studies published between January 2010 and September 2015 account for almost two thirds of the total evidence base. Over half of all studies fall under health and education sectors, though we see in the current decade an emergence of studies in formerly unrepresented sectors. While development impact evaluations are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (60%), studies are increasingly conducted in underrepresented regions such as the Middle East and North Africa.
Communication	Drawing from the stereotype content model, we examine how people respond to likeminded and counter-attitudinal political comments appearing after a news article. We experimentally test how citizens behave when they are able to click on one of three different buttons posted next to others' commentsLike, Recommend, or Respect. In the experiment, political attitudes predicted button clicking, but the button label affected the strength of the relationship. In some instances, people clicked on fewer buttons associated with likeminded comments and more buttons associated with counter-attitudinal comments when the button was labeled with Respect as opposed to Like or Recommend. The pattern of results for the Recommend button differed across two issues. The results suggest that political comments can trigger stereotypical reactions. Although the Like button is well known, news organizations interested in promoting less partisan behaviors should consider using a Respect button rather than the Like or Recommend button in comment sections.
Environmental Studies	We revisit the Prebisch Singer hypothesis of a secular decline in the terms of trade of primary commodities (TTPC) by adopting an approach that differs from previous research. We implement two approaches of time series the mixing distribution methodology and the Markov regime-switching models that have not yet been mobilised for the analysis of TTPC in the long-term. These two approaches allow the identification of a succession of three different dynamic regimes in the TTPC over the 1900-2016 period. The third regime (1986-2005) is characterised by the lowest level of terms of trade of the whole period, and the return to the second regime after 2005 is associated with a level of price significantly higher (57,5% higher). Such an upward shift in primary commodities' prices is unprecedented at the scale of the 20th century and could be an opportunity for developing countries specialised in primary exportations.
History Of Social Sciences	This article owes its inspiration to a series of photos that poetically documents the street lighting conditions in Brazzaville and which was taken by the Congolese photographer Baudouin Mouanda (born 1981). The first section reviews the provision of electricity and street lighting systems in sub-Saharan Africa as an expression of state power and weakness through infrastructural visibility and invisibility. Its aim is to provide a qualitative background and to enhance the situational understanding of the second, site-related section of the article which focuses on Brazzaville, the capital city of the Republic of Congo. Here Mouanda's visual series is interpreted in light of conceptions of the 'shadow' and the 'non-complete', usable in trying to grasp the urban formations and lived realities in the global South.
Family Studies	Family science is at the forefront of understanding the multiple and interconnected risk and protective factors (e.g., poverty vs. wealth, racism and discrimination, privilege) that affect families and the contexts in which they live. In this article, we use the metaphor of spider and web to suggest that family science theorizing is missing an integral piece of the puzzle-the designer of the contexts that have become the field's object of study and intervention (Krieger, 1994). Who or what is this designer? Recognizing that the answer is necessarily complex, we propose a metaphorical spider of insidious influence: White supremacy. Pairing understandings garnered from decades of critical theorizing with a review of the family science literature, we hypothesize about the web of causation and interrogate this culprit. Finally, we offer implications for the consciousness and intentional addition of White supremacy to family science theorizing and methods.
History Of Social Sciences	"Traditionally, American psychology at the turn of the twentieth century has been framed as a competition among a number of ""schools"": structuralism, functionalism, behaviorism, etc. But this is only one way in which the ""structure"" of the discipline can be conceived. Most psychologists did not belong to a particular school, but they still worked within loose intellectual communities, and so their work was part of an implicit psychological ""genre,"" if not a formalized ""school."" In this study, we began the process of discovering the underlying genres of American psychology at the turn of the twentieth century by taking the complete corpus of articles from the journal Psychological Review during the first decade of its publication and conducting a statistical analysis of the vocabularies they employed to see what clusters of articles naturally emerged. Although the traditional functionalist school was among the clusters we found, we also found distinct research traditions around the topics of color vision, spatial vision, philosophy/metatheory, and emotion. In addition, momentary clusters corresponding to important debates (e. g., the variability hypothesis) appeared during certain years, but not others. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Business, Finance	Dynamic hybrid products are innovative life insurance products particularly offered in the German market and intended to meet new consumer needs regarding stability and upside potential. These products are characterised by a periodical rebalancing process between the policy reserves (i.e. the premium reserve stock), a guarantee fund and an equity fund. The policy reserve thereby corresponds to the one also valid for traditional participating life insurance products. Hence, funds of dynamic hybrids that are allocated to the policy reserves in times of adverse capital market environments earn the same policy interest rate determined for the participating life insurance policyholders and, hence, at least a guaranteed interest rate. In this paper, we study the fair valuation and risk situation of an insurer offering both dynamic hybrid and traditional participating life insurance contracts. The results reveal considerable interaction effects between the two contract types within the portfolio that strongly depend on the portfolio composition, thereby emphasising merits as well as risks associated with offering dynamic hybrids.
Urban Studies	"This paper sets forth the hypothesis that the more that a city's economy reflects the creative class and cultural tourism elements that characterize ""new economy""-style postindustrial cities, the more that the police will emphasize heightened order maintenance. Such a thesis is evident in case studies on innovations in urban social control and on cities aspiring to global city status. But the thesis needs empirical test across a large sample of cities that vary on ""new economy"" status, with alternative explanations for variation in order maintenance policing simultaneously taken into account. This paper provides that test for cities above 100,000 in population, controlling for variables representing the racial threat thesis, governing institutions, community policing, and policing demands and constraints. The results provide robust support for the postindustrial policing hypothesis."
Cultural Studies	This article examines the role of the media in the rise of nationalist populism in Finland. The interplay between social media and mainstream media has facilitated the emergence of anti-immigrant agendas into the public debate, which has strengthened nationalist populist politics, despite mainstream journalism following professional ethics of balanced reporting. The article concludes that the traditional journalistic framework of agenda setting is not morally adequate for the new fragmented media environment. It proposes the ethics of hospitality (Derrida, Silverstone) with an emphasis on transnationalism as a moral goal for a multi-ethnic public sphere where everyone has the right to voice concerns and to be heard. Therefore, journalism ethics should address how public debate can be organized in such a way that the principle of hospitality can be achieved. The framework of agenda setting can allow inhospitable discourses to flourish, as the Finnish example shows. Theorisation of hospitality is connected with the need for transnational and cosmopolitan agendas.
Information Science & Library Science	In an attempt to determine and compare the nature of virtual reference services in both academic and public libraries outside the United States, we analyzed data compiled from webform transactions e-mailed to and from libraries via the Question-Point virtual reference service. The study reviewed transactions that were handled during a typical week in April 2006 and in April 2008 by twenty-three libraries in ten countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. We analyzed transactions by language, type of institution (public or academic), question type (access, bibliographic, or subject), answer type, subject, and response time, with attention to how these characteristics had changed in two years. The results of the study provide insight into how students and the general public use virtual reference services in various countries and how service efficiency differs among countries and library types.
Linguistics	When we speak, we do not only produce a chain of words and utterances, but we also perform various body movements that convey information. These movements are usually made with the hands and are what McNeill (1992) terms gestures. Although gesturing is universal, the way we gesture and the meanings we associate with gestures vary cross-culturally. Using a qualitative approach, this paper describes and illustrates the forms and functions of pointing gestures used by Malay speakers. The data discussed is based on 10 video recorded direction-giving interactions. Findings show that pointing among Malay speakers is achieved through the use of various manual pointing gestures and other bodily actions involving gaze, torso and head movements, which communicate distinct functions. This study has indicated that although some gesture forms and functions are shared among Malay speakers and other cultural groups, some direction-giving pointing behaviors are Malay specific.
Industrial Relations & Labor	The present study aimed to add to the extensive variable-centred literature on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model by validating the model using a person-centred approach. A two-step cluster analysis in a sample of Flemish community employees (N = 307) showed that job demands and job resources co-occur in four job profiles: demanding (high demands, low resources), resourceful (low demands, high resources), poor (low demands and low resources) and rich (high demands and high resources) jobs. In line with the JD-R model, employees in demanding jobs evidenced the poorest well-being (high burnout and low work engagement). Resourceful as well as rich jobs were the most optimal job profiles: employees with such profiles reported the least burnout and the most work engagement. The discussion centres on the theoretical lessons learned from the differences among the job profiles, the practical importance of cluster analysis as a diagnostic tool and the presence of job resources.
Rehabilitation	The overarching goal of the Ley Nacional de Discapacidad (LND; National Disability Law [NDL]) enacted by Chile in 2010 is to facilitate positive effects on Quality of Life (QOL) for individuals with disabilities through the promotion of personal relationships, personal development, social inclusion, rights, and self-determination. Of the components linked to QOL in the 2010 law, self-determination may impose the most complex challenge to implement in Chilean society. Self-determination can be viewed as a social value, an individual skill set, or a personal outcome. Self-determination is discussed in relation to Chile's collectivistic society, its history of disability rights, and to Person-Centered Planning, an approach that may enable Chile to fulfill the mandate of its NDL while balancing collectivistic and individualistic values.
Political Science	"The criticism that ordinary voters lack the necessary competence to make policy decisions persists despite the growth, popularity and implementation of direct democratic instruments throughout the democratic world. This article presents a novel measure of voters"" levels of justification as a possible, policy-specific, conceptualization of citizen competence in direct democracy. Using a unique dataset based on thirty-four ballot decisions in Switzerland, the study analyses the levels and correlates of citizen competence. The main findings are, first, that most voters do understand arguments about policies. Secondly, the political context as well as individual resources are important in determining voters"" competence. Finally, with regard to individual resources, motivation is strongly associated with justification levels, while the effect of ability is smaller than expected."
Women'S Studies	This is a preliminary analysis of the Ewha Global Empowerment Program (EGEP), a unique educational program for women activists from Asia and Africa offered by Ewha Womans University. Many feminist scholars teaching women's studies or feminist courses at universities and in adult education programs remark on the many changes feminism has produced in terms of awareness regarding gender discrimination, the numerous social advances for empowering women individually and socially and contributing to the creation of real life changes. The capacity of women's studies to bring about individual and social change is not only because of feminist ideology, but also due to the praxis of feminist pedagogy. Accordingly, research and analysis on feminist pedagogy should reveal the praxis and impact of feminisms, and are very important for the expansion of women's studies and feminist education. In this context, the present study, based on the case of EGEP as a field of 'Asian Feminist Pedagogy,' will look at the concrete makeup of the program and analyze the effects of its praxis on its Asian women activist participants. This study has three parts. The first will briefly review the concept and theory of 'Asian feminisms,' which comprise the epistemological backdrop and theoretical framework of EGEP. The second part explains how the concept of Asian Feminisms is being implemented and practiced as feminist pedagogy. The third part analyzes the experience of the Asian women activists who participated in EGEP to show how it empowers women and produces 'Asian women subjects.'
Rehabilitation	Importance: Evidence supports interventions for social participation for older adults with low vision. Objective: This systematic review examined the evidence for interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to maintain. restore. and improve performance and quality of life in leisure and social participation for older adults with low vision. Data Sources: MEDLINE. PsycINFO. CINAHL, OTseeker. and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles published from January 2010 to March 2017 that described interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for older adults with low vision (mean age 55+). Study Selection and Data Collection: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines were followed and applied for this review. Exclusion criteria included publications outside of the period of the study. participants with mean age <55 yr, and interventions outside the occupational therapy scope of practice. Findings: The search yielded 455 articles. of which 3 Level III studies met the inclusion criteria. Low evidence with high risk of bias was found for interventions supporting social participation. Group therapy, more hours of direct service over a shorter duration. and fitting with low vision devices resulted in improvements in social participation and other outcomes. Conclusion and Relevance: Little evidence exists to support occupational therapy interventions in the areas of leisure and social participation. More research is needed in these areas. What This Article Adds: There continues to be a need for research studies in the areas of leisure and social participation.
Family Studies	This article examines continuity and change in post-separation patterns of parenting across a three-year time span. We analyse longitudinal data from two recent Australian studies: the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey; and the Caring for Children after Parental Separation (CFC) Project. Mother-residence was found to be the most common and the most stable pattern. Though far less common, father-residence also appeared to be reasonably stable. By contrast, shared care was found to be the most fluid of these three parenting configurations.
Transportation	Customer satisfaction is given top priority by all service-oriented industries. The civil aviation industry is no exception. The highly competitive global aviation arena causes various airlines to vie for the top position with lot of importance being given to the customer service. The aim of this study is to analyze the methods and tools used by the United Arab Emirates' (UAE's) federal government and the various local governments in the country to improve the customer satisfaction with regard to the aviation industry in the country. This paper develops a framework to assess customer service in the aviation sector in the UAE and uses the framework to analyze and compare the three main airports in the UAE based on the feedback of passengers. This study used a multi-pronged approach to collect data. In all, 78 travelers were chosen at random and they were administered a structured and a semi-structured questionnaire. Responses to the former were used to perform Chi-square test and establish the differences between the three airports; the latter were used to gain deeper insight and gauge a more in-depth opinion of the respondents. Through the analysis of the data, this study was able to learn more about the public view with regard to the innovations and ideas implemented by the government of the UAE. A new customer service model has been developed to compare the three airports in UAE and gain more insights into opportunities for improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Ethics	The unique problem of lost territory poses one of the most important and complex challenges of compensating for loss and damage due to anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic climate change will cause a significant increase in the sea level for centuries to come. A rising sea level endangers many low-lying coastal areas but also entire states. However, the inundation of an entire state will remain a rare event. Partial loss of territory will be far more pervasive. As measured by the number of states, the area of land, and, in particular, the number of people affected, the phenomenon of partial territorial loss is much more significant. I address this from the perspective of compensatory justice. In particular, I offer (i) background on basic concepts, (ii) an overview and critique of existing accounts, and propose (iii) a novel interpretation of territory as well as (iv) a corresponding criterion of a duty to compensate before (v) I flesh out the overall theory, (vi) take into consideration implications and details of application, and (vii) respond to potential objections.
Sociology	Tokyo's dizzyingly disarrayed built environment almost defies rendering an interpretation of the city's symbolism. To do so, this article puts forth a geography of power approach that imposes order on the urban grid for analyzing Tokyo, both as a symbolic space and as a terrain of struggle. The global ascendance of Tokyo was made possible by the state's developmental economic projects materialized in massive infrastructure and architecture built during two critical conjunctures, when the fate of the city could have turned out differently. Pinpointing critical conjunctures takes seriously historical contingency in writing the histories of particular urban spaces. The article documents inter-scalar political forces fostering developmental urbanization in Japan. Developmental urbanization grew out of geo-politics and the quelling of social turmoil in the aftermath of the Second World War and in the context of increasing globalization during the 1970s-80s. The post-imperial reclamation of Japan's place in the region considers the articulation of Japanese capitalist development in American geo-political networks; the subordination of Japanese social movements and labor; and the tensions inherent in an infrastructural fix to the problem of social conflict.
Substance Abuse	Middle- and high-school substance use is a pressing public health problem in the United States. Despite similar or, in some cases, elevated rates of substance use among rural youth, much of the extant research on adolescent substance use has focused on urban areas. The current study aims to uncover forms of social capital (e.g., ethnic identity), social capital deprivation (e.g., parent-child conflict), and anti-social capital (e.g., delinquent friends) that impact the use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana in a sample of middle- and high-school students from the rural south. It was hypothesized that social capital factors would be associated with decreased substance use while social capital deprivation and anti-social capital factors would be associated with increased substance use. The hypotheses were tested using logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations. The findings indicated that for middle school youth, anti-social capital in the form of aggression and delinquent friends was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of using alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. For high school students, anti-social capital in the form of aggression and delinquent friends and social capital deprivation in the form of neighborhood crime were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of using alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. Violent behavior was also significantly associated with an increased likelihood of using marijuana. Females reported less substance use in both middle and high school; reports of use increased with age. Implications are discussed. Given the salience of social capital deprivation, substance use programs should emphasize the skills necessary to avoid or disengage from antisocial relationships.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This paper analyses how the UK national press has covered local decision-making on options for the integration of health and social care. In England, as part of a major restructuring of health services, the UK government has devolved significant decisions on reorganising services to local areas. This increasing 'localism' in healthcare has been a global trend, albeit an uneven one. The article assesses the insights of Amitai Etzioni and others, as applied to national newspaper coverage of local decisions. It finds Etzioni's analysis to be not fully supported. Following other journalism research on the NHS, we show that contentious points of wider public interest were little reported on, such as international corporate influence and the potential for fragmentation across a national health service.
Management	Previous research has shown that though customer integration during innovation development can enhance companies' innovation performance, it can also harm innovativeness. A possible reason for these contradicting findings is that innovation development is a dynamic process that requires different tasks. Thus, a more fine-grained picture of how customer-oriented companies engage in customer integration throughout the entire innovation development process is necessary. This article contributes to the innovation and marketing literature by providing insights into how companies co-create knowledge about customer needs relevant for innovation development. Using a multiple case study design, this study examines four substantive cases that illustrate the activities logistics service providers undertake to integrate customers during the process of idea generation, development and implementation. The results show that companies focus on both proactive and reactive customer integration during idea generation and implementation but refrain from reactive customer integration during development.
Education & Educational Research	Writing is widely recognized as fundamental to the construction and communication of scientific knowledge. Building on this relationship between writing and knowledge construction, writing-to-learn (WTL) activities have shown to be effective in many science classrooms, but have not been widely implemented at the postsecondary level. To address the lack of implementation, we investigated potential adopters of this pedagogy. Potential adopters, postsecondary faculty, are unique given the key role writing plays in their professional practice as researchers. Because of this unique feature and the fact that an instructor's theoretical orientation toward a construct impacts their instruction of that construct, an investigation of postsecondary faculty's conceptions of writing instruction is necessary to understand the way writing is being used in the postsecondary classroom. To this end, 33 STEM faculty across multiple disciplines and positions were interviewed about writing and its role in their classes. A phenomenographic analysis resulted in four faculty types consisting of unique combinations of concept and practice, organized according to compatibility with WTL. Profiles were built that describe unique conceptions, desired outcomes, and challenges for each type. These profiles provide an understanding of the relationship between faculty's conceptions and instructional practices regarding writing and lay the groundwork for understanding how writing is used in the postsecondary classroom.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	A critical realist analysis is offered of a particular unresolved contention in modern psychiatric knowledge about the diagnosis of personality disorder (PD). With the publication of the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual from the American Psychiatric Association in 2013, this diagnosis stood out as a point of reticence in a document, noted by its critics, for its diagnostic expansionism. Resources from critical realism are used to examine the weakness of the diagnosis and the real enough conduct that the medical codification subsumes. It is concluded that the psychiatric jurisdiction over those with a PD diagnosis now lacks credibility. However, the socio-ethical challenges that lay beneath the diagnosis and beyond its associated medical jurisdiction are not only real but are thrown into sharp relief by the critique offered, raising socio-ethical questions for all citizens.
Sociology	Around the world, there are growing efforts to involve boys and men in the prevention of violence against women: as participants in education programs, as targets of social marketing campaigns, as policy makers and gatekeepers, and as activists and advocates. Efforts to prevent violence against girls and women now increasingly take as given that they must engage men. While there are dangers in doing so, there also is a powerful feminist rationale for such work. This article provides a review of the variety of initiatives, which engage or address men to prevent violence against women. It maps such efforts, locating them within a spectrum of prevention activities. Furthermore, the article identifies or advocates effective strategies in work with men to end violence against women.
Gerontology	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Exercise interventions improve anxiety and mood disturbances in patients with cancer. However, studies are limited in older adults with cancer. We assessed the effects of exercise on anxiety, mood, and social and emotional well-being in older patients with cancer during their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy. DESIGN Exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING Community oncology practices. PARTICIPANTS Older patients (aged 60 years or older) undergoing chemotherapy (N = 252). INTERVENTION Patients were randomized to Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP) or usual care (control) for the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy. EXCAP is a home-based, low- to moderate-intensity progressive walking and resistance training program. MEASUREMENTS Analysis of covariance, with study arm as the factor, baseline value as the covariate, and study arm x baseline interaction, was used to evaluate arm effects on postintervention anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), mood (Profile of Mood States [POMS]), and social and emotional well-being (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General subscales) after 6 weeks. RESULTS Median age was 67 years; 77% had breast cancer. Statistically significant group differences were observed in the STAI score (P = .001), POMS score (P = .022), social well-being (P = .002), and emotional well-being (P = .048). For each outcome, EXCAP patients with worse baseline scores had larger improvements at 6 weeks; these improvements were clinically significant for STAI score and social well-being. CONCLUSIONS Among older cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, a 6-week structured exercise program improved anxiety and mood, especially among those participants with worse baseline symptoms. Additional RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the appropriate exercise prescription for managing anxiety, mood, and well-being in this patient population.

Political Science	"In this paper, we study the relationship between occupational vulnerability and attitudes toward immigration in Western Europe. We measure occupational vulnerability as the risk of unemployment due to routine-biased technological change and offshoring of jobs to other countries. Previous empirical studies in political economy have shown that individuals"" policy preferences echo their economic risks and prospects. Workers in low routine occupations are most worried about their job market prospects, most likely to demand social protection and least likely to support free trade. We find that attitudes toward immigration become considerably more negative as occupational task routineness increases. We do not find a similar association between occupational offshorability and immigration attitudes. Direct exposure to global competition is not associated with increased worries about immigration. However, offshorability seems to be associated with the polarization of attitudes toward immigration between routine and nonroutine workers."
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	We consider estimation of a linear regression model using data where some covariate values are missing but imputations are available to fill in the missing values. This situation generates a tradeoff between bias and precision when estimating the regression parameters of interest. Using only the subsample of complete observations does not cause bias but may imply a substantial loss of precision because the complete cases may be too few. On the other hand, filling in the missing values with imputations may cause bias. We provide the new Stata command gmi, which handles such tradeoff by using either model reduction or Bayesian model averaging techniques in the context of the generalized missing-indicator approach recently proposed by Dardanoni, Modica, and Peracchi (2011, Journal of Econometrics 162: 362-368). If multiple imputations are available, gmi can also be combined with the built-in Stata prefix mi estimate to account for extra variability due to imputation. We illustrate the use of gmi with an empirical application in the health domain, where item nonresponse is substantial.
Environmental Studies	This paper analyses how the current concept of landscape, which overcomes a scenery-based characterisation and a confinement to classical aesthetics and art, relates to the notions of the common good, commons and commons pool resources (CPRs). I consider landscape as a complex process in which human beings (with their history and culture) and their environment are mutually defined. On the basis of this approach to landscape studies, and by considering contemporary documents on landscape (i.e. the European Landscape Convention, the Latin American Initiative for Landscape and the UNESCO Florence Declaration) I analyse the similarity between the notion of landscape and the concepts of common good, the management of commons and the commons pool resources institutions. Through theoretical research supported by practical examples (e.g. community gardens) I argue that landscape can be defined as a common good, can include the commons, and the collective management of lands and common pool resources institutions. The paper relies on an excursus through the theories and legal documents, with a specific regard to the theoretical foundations of these different notions. The analysis carried out in the paper leads, in the end, to the possibility of defining the `right to landscape'. Even if the concept is new in the literature, and a right to landscape is not recognised as a right per se, it is already implicated and studied in many international rights laws. Three approaches to landscape as a right have been distinguished: the right to landscape as a perceived landscape (a collective right), as a right to the environment and a right for addressing human rights. I integrated these approaches by arguing that landscape is a domain in relation to which human rights can be claimed, and that landscape can be considered as a right to which human beings are entitled.
International Relations	In the lead up to the 10th anniversary of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) agreement, pillar II (which refers to international assistance with state consent) was heralded by the United Nations Special Advisor on R2P as the most promising aspect of the Responsibility to Protect. With so little written on pillar II, however, it is difficult to evaluate this judgement. Addressing this lacuna, this article scrutinizes the promise of pillar II to highlight two key strengths. First, the consensual support for pillar II among UN member states reveals that even those that were critical of the R2P in the aftermath of Libya in 2011 still favour the idea of international assistance. At the same time, there remain concerns over the use of force within pillar II as illustrated by events in Cote d'Ivoire in 2011. Second, the utility of pillar II lies in its potential for addressing the threat posed by non-state armed groups. This is particularly important when one considers that in thirteen of the fourteen years since 2000, rebel groups (rather than governments) have been the primary perpetrators of one-sided mass killing against civilians. Accordingly, pillar II can be seen to hold considerable promise for tackling the threat of mass violence by non-state armed groups in the twenty-first century. However, the article also raises concerns over unintentionally legitimizing illegitimate governments through assistance. To illustrate these points it draws on the assistance provided in Mali (2013-15) and Iraq (2014-15).
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	The recommendation for the frequency for routine clinical monitoring of persons with well-controlled HIV infection is based on evidence that relies on observed rather than intended follow-up intervals. We sought to determine if the scheduled follow-up interval is associated with subsequent virologic failure. Participants in this 6-clinic retrospective cohort study had an index clinic visit in 2008 and HIV viral load (VL) <= 400 c/mL. Univariate and multivariate tests evaluated if scheduling the next follow-up appointment at 3, 4, or 6 months predicted VL >400 c/mL at 12 months (VF). Among 2171 participants, 66%, 26%, and 8% were scheduled next follow-up visits at 3, 4, and 6 months, respectively. With missing 12-month VL considered VF, 25%, 25%, and 24% of persons scheduled at 3, 4, and 6 months had VF, respectively (p = 0.95). Excluding persons with missing 12-month VL, 7.1%, 5.7%, and 4.5% had VF, respectively (p = 0.35). Multivariable models yielded nonsignificant odds of VF by scheduled follow-up interval both when missing 12-month VL were considered VF and when persons with missing 12-month VL were excluded. We conclude that clinicians are able to make safe decisions extending follow-up intervals in persons with viral suppression, at least in the short-term.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the best placement of windows in short-term rehabilitation facilities in terms of daylighting and outdoor views by exploring the impact of windows on resident perception of stress, mood, activities, and satisfaction. Background: The physiological and psychological benefits of daylighting have made it an increasingly important topic in multidisciplinary research. Although multiple studies have been written about the impact of daylight on physiological responses, few investigations have been made into the nonvisual effects related to resident mood, satisfaction, and stress level. In addition, researchers typically propose recommendations for quantitative aspects of illuminance, rather than addressing the behavioural outcomes. Methods: A combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to address the research questions. Thirty-four participants, who were living temporarily in the inpatient rehabilitation units of two skilled nursing facilities, were subjects in semistructured interviews and a 7-question 5-scale survey. While residents expressed the need to have direct visual access to the outdoors, they indicated that daylight was of even higher benefit. Additionally, they noted that size and location of windows impacted their stress levels, moods, and activities. More than half of the facility residents reported changing their postures for either better outdoor views or less light disturbance while sleeping. Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the importance of daylighting for residents in rehabilitation units. Architects should acknowledge the role of daylighting and window views in the design of rehabilitation facilities.
Business	We leverage a temporary block of the Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo due to political events to estimate the causal effect of online word-of-mouth content on product demand in the context of TV show viewership. Based on this source of exogenous variation, we estimate an elasticity of TV show ratings (market share in terms of viewership) with respect to the number of relevant comments (comments were disabled during the block) of 0.016. We find that more postshow microblogging activity increases demand, whereas comments posted prior to the show airing do not affect viewership. These patterns are inconsistent with informative or persuasive effects and suggest complementarity between TV consumption and anticipated postshow microblogging activity.
Women'S Studies	This article deals in women instructors (somchot), veteran immigrants from Ethiopia, who are employed as part of the absorption mechanism for immigrants from Ethiopia in Israel. They were instructed to teach domestic functions according to Israeli norms. However, when fulfilling these functions, the instructors also afford cultural interpretations and add their own messages. The article presents three foci in the instructors' work. One focus is on cleanliness and health. In compliance with the state's instructions they impart the Israeli model of domestic cleanliness and personal hygiene to the immigrants. A second focus is a message regarding partnership, which deviates from their role definition and views maintaining the intactness of the marriage among the immigrants as essential for the absorption process. The third focus is the attitude toward the immigrants' ethnic tradition. It is apparent that the women instructors, out of emotional identification, are in favor of the preservation of their culture. Culturally the instructor is Ethiopian on the one hand and Israeli on the other. Israeli society has entrusted her with the role of imparting the Israeli culture. However, she is at the same time an immigrant who lacks power herself. Nonetheless, these women instructors perceive themselves as representatives of the absorbing establishment and strive to resemble the Israeli reference group. The work of these instructors can be viewed as feminist activity of teaching the female immigrants ways in which they can identify tools which they need for coping with the gap between the traditional and the new norms.

Nursing	"School nurses provide health promotion and health services within schools, as healthy children have a greater potential for optimal learning. One of the school nurses"" role is in encouraging healthy eating and increasing the availability of fruits and vegetables in the school. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe school nurses"" perceptions of their role in promoting increased fruit and vegetable consumption in the school setting. One avenue to increased availability of fruits and vegetables in schools is Farm to School programs mandated by the Federal government to improve the health of school children. School nurses are optimally positioned to work with Farm to School programs to promote healthy eating. A secondary aim was to explore school nurses"" knowledge, experiences and/or perceptions of the Farm to School program to promote fruit and vegetable consumption in the school setting. Three themes emerged from the focus groups: If There Were More of Me, I Could Do More; Food Environment in Schools; School Nurses Promote Health. School nurses reported that they addressed health issues more broadly in their roles as educator, collaborator, advocate and modeling healthy behaviors. Most of the participants knew of Farm to School programs, but only two school nurses worked in schools that participated in the program. Consequently, the participants reported having little or no experiences with the Farm to School programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Information Science & Library Science	"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate information retrieval (IR) in the context of authentic work tasks (WTs), as compared to traditional experimental IR study designs. Design/methodology/approach - The participants were 22 professionals working in municipal administration, university research and education, and commercial companies. The data comprise 286 WTs and 420 search tasks (STs). The data were collected in natural situations. It includes transaction logs, video recordings, interviews, observation, and daily questionnaires. Findings - The analysis included the effects of WT type and complexity on the number of STs, queries, search keys and types of queries. The findings suggest that simple STs are enough to support most WTs. Complex WTs (vs more simple ones) and intellectual WTs (vs communication, support and editing WTs) include more STs than other WT categories. Research limitations/implications - Further research should address the problems related to controllability of field studies and enhance the use of realistic WT situations in test-based studies, as well. Originality/value - The study is an attempt to bring traditional IR studies and realistic research settings closer to each other. Using authentic WTs when studying IR is still rare. The representativeness of the WT/ST types used in interactive IR experiments should be carefully addressed: in the work flow, people seldom consciously recognise separate ""STs"". This means that STs may mainly be an academic construct even to the point that studying IR without a decent context does violence to the further understanding of the phenomenon."
Industrial Relations & Labor	During the construction boom that began in 2000, construction employment rose later and with more intensity in New York City than in the Nation as a whole, while the eventual construction bust was later but less severe in the City than nationally; the City's gains and losses were concentrated in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens
Cultural Studies	This article examines how the growth of socio-political songs in Kenya reflects the effect of the evolution of information technology (IT). The unprecedented proliferation of IT - especially mobile telephony, the Internet and frequency modulation (FM) radio - has played havoc with authoritarian control of information, especially by governments. The speed and modes through which information and song are transferred have diversified, making it possible to send, receive and access both quite easily. Using three epochs of leadership in Kenya, we show how the dynamics of the socio-political song have transformed from an authoritarian regime, when the state muzzled freedom of expression, to a more democratic era of IT, where artists can more easily reach their audience. By analysing music with lyrics and secondary data, we show that freedom of speech is as important as the proliferation of IT. Both are necessary conditions for the growth of socio-political song.
Communication	The increasing commercialization of media markets in Denmark and abroad have led to concerns about journalism's role in democracy. In discussions about the influence of budget cuts and increased competition on the way journalists work, the difference between political journalists and other journalists is often disregarded. This paper argues that commercialization has a polarizing effect. It strengthens the political beat at the expense of other beats, as political news is cost-effective and a way for outlets to brand themselves. Representative surveys among parliamentary reporters and other Danish journalists confirm that commercial pressures affect political journalists less than other journalists, even those working in other prestigious beats. This has negative implications from the viewpoint of participatory democracy; while other journalists emphasize a role as promoters of a citizen perspective, parliamentary journalists see it as their main role to demand accountability rather than responsiveness of politicians.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Despite ongoing 'boom' conditions in the Australian mining industry, women remain substantially and unevenly under-represented in the sector, as is the case in other resource-dependent countries. Building on the literature critiquing business-case rationales and strategies as a means to achieve women's equality in the workplace, we examine the business case for employing more women as advanced by the Australian mining industry. Specifically, we apply a discourse analysis to seven substantial, publically-available documents produced by the industry's national and state peak organizations between 2005 and 2013. Our study makes two contributions. First, we map the features of the business case at the sectoral rather than firm or workplace level and examine its public mobilization. Second, we identify the construction and deployment of a normative identity - 'the ideal mining woman' - as a key outcome of this business-case discourse. Crucially, women are therein positioned as individually responsible for gender equality in the workplace.
Communication	This article takes as its departure point the questions Which discourses figure in the news media's coverage of natural disasters?' and What are the possible unintended consequences of this type of crisis communication?' The overall aim is to elucidate the development of risk discourses, struggles over discursive legitimacy, and shifts in argumentation to legitimate or delegitimate certain actors and actions in relation to a widespread and devastating wildfire in the summer of 2014 in Sweden. The chosen media outlets are one national agenda-setting morning newspaper, one national evening tabloid, and one local newspaper. All coverage in these newspapers from the period of the wildfire (1-31 August 2014) were selected and analyzed. By employing a critical discourse analysis of three different newspapers' crisis communication flows during the one-month-long wildfire, we show how crisis communication is in fact embedded in discourses of power related to gender and rurality.
History	The Roman Empire and barbaricum were inextricably linked throughout the Roman Iron Age. By late antiquity, Germanic-speaking trans-Rhenan areas were inundated with imperial influence. Migration was two-way and in various forms, all of which, including large-scale 'folk movement', were normal: part and parcel of the imperial frontier's dynamics. The counter-intuitive conclusion is drawn from this that the relationship between the existence of a formal frontier and significant migration is quite the opposite of the one we have grown used to imagining. The collapse of the frontier took with it the mechanisms for migration. Therefore I have to modify my 2007 epigram that 'the end of the Roman Empire produced the Barbarian Invasions and not vice versa'. The end of the Roman Empire put an end to the barbarian migrations. This conclusion helps us contribute more responsibly to modern debate on migration. It also contributes to a discussion of the formation of Germany. The end of migration changed the political dynamics of the regions between Rhine and Baltic. The latter became more inward-facing and from these, eventually, emerged 'Germany'.
International Relations	Constructivists maintain that a shared identity was crucial for explaining the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the multilateral form that it took. I challenge this view, arguing instead that the alliance was based on moralistic trust, the belief that others will live up to their moral obligations. Moralistic trust facilitates the initiation of cooperation, so that states can begin a virtuous circle of trust, collaboration, and enhanced trust. It is also the foundation of the diffuse reciprocity inherent to multilateralism. In two case studies of the domestic politics in the United States of making a multilateral security commitment to Europe, the first being the League of Nations, I demonstrate that identity was not a prominent consideration and did not lead individuals to embrace multilateralism. This social-psychological account improves upon constructivism and rationalism by offering a way to embed ideational variables in studies of strategic interaction.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This paper investigates how groups of 'citizen scientists' in non-traditional settings and primarily online networks claim to be challenging conventional genomic research processes and norms. Although these groups are highly diverse, they all distinguish their efforts from traditional university-or industry-based genomic research as being 'participant-driven' in one way or another. Participant-driven genomic research (PDGR) groups often work from 'labs' that consist of servers and computing devices as much as wet lab apparatus, relying on information-processing software for data-driven, discovery-based analysis rather than hypothesis-driven experimentation. We interviewed individuals from a variety of efforts across the expanding ecosystem of PDGR, including academic groups, start-ups, activists, hobbyists, and hackers, in order to compare and contrast how they relate their stated objectives, practices, and political and moral stances to institutions of expert scientific knowledge production. Results reveal that these groups, despite their diversity, share commitments to promoting alternative modes of housing, conducting, and funding genomic research and, ultimately, sharing knowledge. In doing so, PDGR discourses challenge existing approaches to research governance as well, especially the regulation, ethics, and oversight of human genomic information management. Interestingly, the reaction of the traditional genomics research community to this revolutionary challenge has not been negative: in fact, the community seems to be embracing the ethos espoused by PDGR, at the highest levels of science policy. As conventional genomic research assimilates the ethos of PDGR, the movement's 'democratizing' views on research governance are likely to become normalized as well, creating new tensions for science policy and research ethics.
Business, Finance	This paper contributes to the empirical evidence on the investment horizon salient to trading based on predicting the error in analysts' earnings forecasts. An econometric framework is proposed that accommodates the stylized fact of extreme values in the forecast error series. We find that between 1998 and 2010, the strategy of taking a long (short) position in stocks with the most pessimistic (optimistic) I/B/E/S forecast has an annual risk-adjusted return of 16.56 per cent before transaction costs. The robust method used to predict this pessimism (optimism) and the one-week investment horizon are the key drivers of the strategy's profitability.
Political Science	The 2013 federal election led to a considerable change in the German party system. Yet Chancellor Merkel secured a third term, once again, as chancellor of a grand coalition. This analysis shows that Angela Merkel was much more popular than her SPD challenger, Peer Steinbruck. Moreover, she was perceived as somewhat more representative of the values and policies of the party she stood for than her competitor. What is more, the candidates' perceived representativeness conditioned the impact of candidate preferences on vote choice in complex ways. As a result, support for Angela Merkel was likely to translate into votes for the CDU/CSU, whereas support for Peer Steinbruck did not easily earn SPD votes. The article thus concludes that, in contrast to her challenger, Angela Merkel was an electoral asset for her party. The CDU/CSU's impressive result in the 2013 federal outcome can thus be interpreted, to some extent, as reflecting its leader's popularity.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose - Police leaders and leadership remain understudied within existing criminal justice scholarship. Using data derived from police supervisors participating in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy program, the purpose of this paper is to examine effective leaders and leadership. Specific consideration is given to the traits and habits of effective and ineffective leaders, the assessment of leadership efficacy, the development of leaders, and the barriers to the expansion of more effective leaders and leadership in contemporary policing. Design/methodology/approach - Surveys were administered to over 1,000 police supervisors. Respondents ranked the traits and habits of effective and ineffective leaders, methods to evaluate leadership efficacy, and barriers to the expansion of more effective leaders and leadership. Though a convenience sample, the supervisors represent a diverse mix of police agencies of various sizes and types from around the world. Findings - Ratings suggest respondents saw effective and ineffective leaders as expressing nearly opposite sets of traits and habits. Efficacy was most strongly linked with integrity, work ethic, communication, and care for personnel; ineffective leaders were characterized as failing to express these traits. Respondents cast leadership development as a process best-achieved through a mixture of training/education, experience, and feedback. Surprisingly, the most highly-rated barriers to the expansion of effective leaders and leadership practices were not fiscal, but cultural, structural, and political. Research limitations/implications - Findings suggest key policy implications for police organizations and the policing profession. Many highly-rated traits and habits may be linked with personality traits; this could complicate the capacity of leadership development initiatives to enhance these behaviors. Results suggest development programs need to do more than simply expose students to a diverse set of theories and perspectives of leadership; mentoring and guided experience were also rated as helpful. Major barriers to the expansion of effective leadership were not issues easily or quickly overcome, complicating the long-term prospects of enhancing the quality of leadership within policing. Originality/value - Given the paucity of systemic and large-scale studies of police leadership, the findings offer important parameters to guide future research efforts. Though some results validate what might be assumed about police leadership, that validation is largely absent from the extant literature. The results provide a starting basis to guide subsequent research assessing the outcomes, evaluation, and development of police leaders.
Demography	Asylum systems in the Western Balkans are one of the many results of the externalization of European Union border controls. Regardless of the hopes that the EU might have for these systems to function as a buffer zone, there is a need to be realistic about the actual effect that these systems can have. There are a number of gaps showing that the countries in the region are neither willing nor able to process the number of asylum applications that could potentially be lodged by all the persons transiting the region today. These gaps include the lack of capacity to identify and register asylum seekers and to process asylum applications, the failure to conduct refugee status determination procedures in line with basic legal standards, the lack of return procedures and the inability to develop all the necessary systems (such as detention and return) in parallel.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper details the responses made by social scientists as well as criminal justice practitioners during 1932 to a study focusing on the status of criminology by the Bureau of Social Hygiene. These responses ultimately led to the publication of the controversial Crime, Law and Social Science (1933), which gave much-needed direction to the development of criminology. Despite the importance of these responses to the creation of criminological thought, only one (by Edwin H. Sutherland) has previously been published. Examining the responses of all of the individual participants in the project gives a clearer picture of controversies and changes which ultimately occurred as the field of criminology gradually became institutionalized as an academic discipline.

Substance Abuse	Background and Objectives: Research has indicated that the buprenorphine-mono product yields maternal outcomes similar to methadone and a less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome. However, maternal and neonatal outcomes following buprenorphine + naloxone exposure during pregnancy have not been documented. Methods: Retrospective chart review identified 10 opioid-dependent pregnant women treated with the buprenorphine + naloxone film product between January, 2010-June, 2011. Seven maternal outcome measures - weight gain, fetal presentation at delivery, Cesarean delivery, analgesia during delivery, urine drug screening results at delivery, number of days of maternal hospital stay, and began breastfeeding following delivery-and eleven neonatal outcome measures-gestational age at delivery, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, head circumference, length, and weight at birth, treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), total amount of morphine sulfate needed to treat NAS, length of hospital stay for NAS treatment, and length of hospital stay-were extracted from medical records. Results: Maternal findings were unremarkable, and comparable with what might be found following treatment with the buprenorphine-mono product. Neonates were full-term with normal birth parameters. Four neonates were treated for NAS, and number of days treated for NAS and number of hospital days were in line with values reported for the buprenorphine-mono product. Conclusions: Findings suggest no obvious significant adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes related to the use of buprenorphine + naloxone for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy. Scientific Significance: These initial findings underscore the need for future research to systematically examine the relative safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine + naloxone for mother, fetus, and child.
Health Policy & Services	The Canada Health Act 1984 (CHA) is considered foundational to Canada's publicly funded health care system (known as Medicare). The CHA provides for the federal transfer of funding to the provinces/territories, in exchange for provincial/territorial adherence to Medicare's key principles of universality; comprehensiveness; portability; accessibility; and, public administration. Medicare is a decentralized health care system, managed independently by Canada's 10 provincial and three territorial governments, allowing for regional adaptations to fit varying degrees of urbanity, remoteness and needs. The Act is silent on its relationship to the Indigenous health care system - what some have described as Canada's 14th health care system. The CHA has not kept pace with Indigenous self-government activities that have since spread across Canada. It has unfortunately crystallized the federal/provincial/territorial/Indigenous jurisdictional fragmentation that perpetuates health inequities and has failed to clarify these jurisdictions' obligations towards Indigenous peoples. As a result of these omissions, access to health services remains a concern for many Indigenous Canadians, resulting in poorer outcomes and premature mortality. In this paper, I argue that Medicare renewal must: make an explicit commitment to Indigenous health equity; clarify jurisdictional obligations; establish effective mechanisms for addressing areas of jurisdictional dispute and/or confusion; and explicitly recognize First Nations and Inuit health care services as integral yet distinct systems, that nevertheless must be welcomed to seamlessly work with provincial health care systems to ensure continuity of care.
Geography	"The racial and cultural politics of land and property are central to urban struggle, but have received relatively little attention in geography. This paper analyzes land struggles in Detroit where over 100,000 parcels of land are classified as vacant. Since 2010, planners and government officials have been developing controversial plans to ruralize Detroit""s vacant neighborhoods as part of a program of fiscal austerity, reigniting old questions of racialized dispossession, sovereignty, and struggles for liberation. This paper analyzes these contentious politics by examining disputes over a white businessman""s proposal to build the world""s largest urban forest in the center of a Black majority city. I focus on how residents, urban farmers, and community activists resisted the project by making counterclaims to vacant land as an urban commons. They argued that the land is inhabited not empty and that it belonged to those who labored upon and suffered for it. Combining community-based ethnography with insights from critical property theory, critical race studies, and postcolonial theory, I argue that land struggles in Detroit are more than distributional conflicts over resources. They are inextricable from debates over notions of race, property, and citizenship that undergird modern liberal democracies and ongoing struggles for decolonization."
Geography	"The subtropical Atlantic Forest is a highly diverse ecosystem in South America and one of the most endangered rain forests in the world. The present study focuses specifically on the Paraguayan part of the tri-national Atlantic Forest. Over the last decades, the Paraguayan Atlantic Forest presented one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and today, only a small share remains. Hence, forest loss in Paraguay""s Atlantic Forest was detected and analysed through remote sensing and GIS methodologies based on Landsat images obtained in 2003 and 2013. The objective of this study was to examine the spatial impact of forest loss in Paraguay""s Atlantic Forest over the past decade with a special focus on biodiversity conservation. Classifications results obtained overall accuracies above 83% and revealed that over 6000 km(2) of forest was cleared during the study period. The forest landscape and its fragmentation level were characterised through a set of landscape metrics, in particular the proximity analysis which support the identification of forest priority areas for nature conservation and potential biological corridors. In summary, the study revealed that deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest area continued, but at a slower pace than that in the previous decade. Protected areas were conserved very effectively; however, forest core areas without any protection status require further attention. Intact forest patches and their connectivity are a crucial prerequisite to biodiversity conservation in a highly fragmented forest area. The combination of different remote sensing and GIS methods provides valuable information for sustainable forest management in the region. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Information Science & Library Science	Trust is the most important characteristic of digital repositories designed to hold and deliver archival documents that have persistent value to stakeholders. In theoretical models of trust in information, the concept of trustworthiness is emerging as both fundamentally important and understudied, particularly in the domain of digital repositories. This article reports on a qualitative study designed to elicit from groups of end users components of trustworthiness and to assess their relative importance. The study draws on interview data from 3 focus groups with experienced users of the Washington State Digital Archives. Utilizing thematic analysis and micro-interlocutor analysis to examine a combination of interview transcripts and video recordings, the study provides a realistic picture of the strength and character of emergent themes that underpin the more general concept of trustworthiness. The study reinforces the centrality of trustworthiness at the individual document level, but calls into question the formulation of trustworthiness as a concept in Kelton, Fleischmann, and Wallace's (2008) Integrated Model of Trust in Information.
Criminology & Penology	Body-worn cameras are a promising new development in policing. They have been linked to positive outcomes such as decreases in use of force and complaints against officers. However, this new technology has produced a number of issues that could thwart a successful body-worn camera program implementation. One issue is the extent to which officers possess positive attitudes toward using body-worn cameras. If officers do not view body-worn cameras positively, they may not use cameras to their full potential. This study examined the relationship between organizational justice and attitudes toward body-worn cameras in 492 police officers across 3 agencies using structural equation modeling. Findings indicated no observable relationship between perceptions of organizational justice and attitudes toward body-worn cameras. The implications for the organizational adoption of innovations in policy are discussed.
Anthropology	Objectives The current study seeks to determine if a sample of foragers, farmers, and pastoralists are distinguishable based on their dental microwear texture signatures. Materials and methods The study included a sample of 719 individuals from 51 archeological sites (450 farmers, 192 foragers, 77 pastoralists). All were over age 12 and sexes were pooled. Using a Sensofar (R) white-light confocal profiler we collected dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) data from a single first or second molar from each individual. We leveled and cleaned data clouds following standard procedures and analyzed the data with Sfrax (R) and Toothfrax (R) software. The DMTA variables were complexity and anisotropy. Statistics included ANOVA with partial eta squared and Hedges's g. We also performed a follow-up K-means cluster analysis. Results We found significant differences between foragers and farmers and pastoralists for complexity and anisotropy, with foragers having greater complexity than either the farmers or the pastoralists. The farmers and pastoralists had greater anisotropy than the foragers. The Old World foragers had significantly higher anisotropy values than New World foragers. Old and New World farmers did not differ. Among the Old World farmers, those dating from the Neolithic through the Late Bronze Age had higher complexity values than those from the Iron Age through the medieval period. The cluster analysis discerned foragers and farmers but also indicated similarity between hard food foragers and hard food farmers. Discussion Our findings reaffirm that DMTA is capable of distinguishing human diets. We found that foragers and farmers, in particular, differ in their microwear signatures across the globe. There are some exceptions, but nothing that would be unexpected given the range of human diets and food preparation techniques. This study indicates that in general DMTA is an efficacious means of paleodietary reconstruction in humans.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: To determine the current state of pain education across physiotherapy programs in Canada. Materials and methods: Educators that were responsible for teaching pain-related content at each of the 14 Canadian physiotherapy programs were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey. The online survey evaluated total time spent on pain education and the integration of content from international guidelines on pain education curricula. Results and conclusions: Complete data were obtained from all Canadian physiotherapy programs. The total median time spent on pain education was 18 h, ranging from 8 to 65 h. Across all programs, only 38.6% of the recommended pain curriculum themes were fully integrated within physiotherapy programs. Most of the curriculum themes were partially addressed (median: 52.6%) and a small minority were not addressed (median: 10.5%). There was an overall trend in which greater time spent on pain education corresponded to a higher proportion of pain curriculum themes that were fully integrated. This is the first national survey of pain education that has included all physiotherapy programs across Canada. These data provide a foundation for understanding the current resources and content dedicated to pain education and are an essential step in benchmarking and potentially improving pain education for physiotherapists.
Gerontology	"The aim of this study was to investigate walking and health among woman age 75 yr or older, in the associations between the highest step up performed without support by an individual and balance, walking, and health among women age 75+. Records of the highest step, balance, walking, and health were made for 307 women age 75-93 yr living in the community. Eighty percent managed to climb steps higher than 20 cm. There was a statistically significant negative relationship between age and stair-climbing capacity. The highest steps registered were significantly and independently associated with a short time on the timed up-and-go test, long functional reach, low body weight, lack of perceived difficulty walking outdoors, low number of ""missteps"" when walking in a figure of 8, longer time in one-leg stance, ability to carry out tandem stance, no walking aids outdoors, and not being afraid of falling. These variables together explained 67% of the variance in the step-height score."
History Of Social Sciences	The history of planning and social housing in post-war Britain has been dominated by the role of the state, local government, professionals (planners, architects, civil servants) and developers. This is hardly surprising, given that the partnerships created around these groups dominated the slum clearance and building process. The tenants have been absent from the 'history' because they were missing from the process. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the concept of participation began to emerge. It grew from broader social and cultural changes brought about through the emergence of welfare, consumerism and an ever greater awareness of 'rights'. The idea of participation was to increase participatory democracy by involving people in the planning process, by recognizing their rights to be involved in decisions which impacted on their lives. The state promoted the idea through legislation, but in practice the concept proved difficult to implement. Local authorities saw participation, at best, as a means of smoothing the planning process through the dissemination of ideas, thus limiting any scope for meaningful participation schemes. This article will look at the tension between the ideal and practice. It will also consider the reaction of many tenants who, frustrated at the attitude and policies forced on them by local government, became galvanized into action, creating tenant groups that would give their communities a voice.
Development Studies	Many methodologies exist for dividing a population into those who are classified as eligible for social transfers and those who are ineligible. Popular targeting mechanisms include means tests, proxy means tests, categorical, geographic, community-based and self-selection. This paper reviews empirical evidence from a range of social protection programmes on the accuracy of these mechanisms, in terms of minimising four targeting errors: inclusion and exclusion, by eligibility and by poverty. This paper also reviews available evidence on the various costs associated with targeting, not only administrative but also private, social, psycho-social, incentive-based and political costs. Comparisons are difficult, but all mechanisms generate targeting errors and costs. Given the inevitability of trade-offs, there is no best' mechanism for targeting social transfers. The key determinant of relative accuracy and cost-effectiveness in each case is how well the targeting mechanism is designed and implemented.
Political Science	Recent years have witnessed a rise of contentious political activity across the world heralding what some perceive as a new major cycle of protest. Much attention has focused on Europe, where the economic crisis generated considerable social unrest deemed comparable to earlier waves of protest. This article seeks to examine the basic constituents of the social forces unleashed by this economic crisis and to assess the main motivations driving this new cycle of protest. It distinguishes between conventional and radical political activity and seeks to identify the main correlates of each. The article uses an original telephone survey designed, piloted, and conducted in Greece (n = 5025) to construct a 12-item conventionalism scale and a 10-item radicalism scale. Using psychometric techniques, it assesses the effects of various independent variables on the two modes of political action. The article finds that, even in this economic crisis-hit setting, economic deprivation has a minimal effect on the two modes of behavior. Ideology, especially on the left of the political spectrum, has the strongest effect on both radical and conventional political action. Despite the major changes in the political context brought about by the economic crisis, political action displays significant continuity with the past.
Communication	Like the indigenous media activists elsewhere, rural migrant individuals in China are now using digital DV camera to produce work to document the lives and work of rural migrants in the Chinese city. In doing so, rural migrant filmmakers provide perspectives which may be alternative to, and critical of, dominant culture. So what kind of political and cultural socialisation is necessary in turning a rural migrant into a cultural activist? What kind of activist imaginary has emerged from this kind of cultural activism? What is the role of NGOs and cultural elites in the development of this cultural phenomenon, and, finally, what challenges and possibility lie ahead for this development? This paper seeks to address these broad questions through two extended case studies of activist initiatives: a rural migrant's journey of becoming an activist filmmaker, and the aspiration and frustrations of a domestic worker film project.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In this paper, we consider a stochastic model in which a business enterprise is subject to constant rate of expenses over time and gains which are random in both time and amount. Inspired by Albrecher & Boxma (2004), it is assumed in general that the size of a given gain has an impact on the time until the next gain. Under such a model, we are interested in various quantities related to the survival of the business after default, which include: (i) the fair price of a perpetual insurance which pays the expenses whenever the available capital reaches zero; (ii) the probability of recovery by the first gain after default if money is borrowed at the time of default; and (iii) the Laplace transforms of the time of recovery and the first duration of negative capital. To this end, a function resembling the so-called Gerber-Shiu function (Gerber & Shiu (1998)) commonly used in insurance analysis is proposed. The function's general structure is studied via the use of defective renewal equations, and its applications to the evaluation of the above-mentioned quantities are illustrated. Exact solutions are derived in the independent case by assuming that either the inter-arrival times or the gains have an arbitrary distribution. A dependent example is also considered and numerical illustrations follow.
Transportation	This research investigated the role of parental psychological and socio-economic factors as well as built environment for the choice of their children's (primary school pupils, aged 7-9 years) travel mode to school in Rasht, Iran. A total of 1078 questionnaires were distributed (return rate of 80 percent) among pupils in nine primary schools in January 2014. A mixed logit (ML) model was employed due to its ability to test heterogeneity among parents and also to determine its possible sources. Results of random coefficient ML modelling showed that several psychological, socio-economic and built environment characteristics were significant factors in parental mode choice. Only walking time perception to school had a significant random normal distribution coefficient and no other psychological and socio-economic variable had a random effect. Further investigation by random coefficient analysis showed that the possible source of household preference heterogeneity could be to own two or more cars. Regarding psychological variables, strong parental worry about their children walking alone to school had a negative impact on allowing them to walk to school. Parents who evaluated poor contextual and design preconditions for walking tended to choose school service more than private car and walking. Parents with stronger environmental personal norms were more willing to allow their children to walk. The findings suggest that infrastructural measures, such as sidewalk facilities, neighborhood security and safety, encourage parents to allow children to walk to school. Information campaigns targeting environmental norms may increase walking among pupils in an Iranian setting.
Rehabilitation	Despite the prominence of sexual health concerns in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population, education regarding sexual functioning and related matters is not well integrated into rehabilitation processes or ongoing care in SCI. Conceptual sexual health care frameworks encompass a range of biopsychosocial factors and recommend utilizing an interdisciplinary approach to meet the diverse needs of individuals with disabilities. Yet, it is rare to have a truly integrated treatment team dedicated to sexual health and functioning in SCI rehabilitative settings. The program described in this article attempts to align itself with proposed recommendations regarding sexual health assessment, intervention, education, and provision of resources for those living with SCI. The aim is to provide individualized and better-coordinated sexual health interventions specific to the cultural, religious, physical, emotional, cognitive, sexual orientation, and gender identity needs of the patients served. Three case reports illustrate how the interdisciplinary sexual health rehabilitation program operated. A review of program challenges and future directions are also discussed.
Women'S Studies	The project of the French Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU) in Morocco in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries-to win social and political equality for Jews through European enlightenment-was intertwined with the French imperial project. Moroccan Jewish women were assigned, as mothers and wives, a special role in the AIU's efforts: to help Jewish boys and men pursue commercial or professional careers in French-dominated society. The AIU schools set out to win Moroccan Jews away from despised Muslim gender and sexual norms by Europeanizing Jews' marriage patterns and family forms, combating prostitution, eliminating women's traditional head coverings, and reining in what the AIU saw as men's promiscuity and homosexual tendencies. Ultimately, the AIU helped further estrange Moroccan Jews from Muslims but failed to secure Moroccan Jews' smooth integration into French secular culture. Moroccan Jews in Israel today, faced with persistent discrimination, largely cling to religiously based, conservative gender norms.
Ethnic Studies	Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.
Sociology	This article interrogates West and Zimmerman's Doing Gender paradigm by examining the Muxes of Juchitan, a little known third gender in El Istmo de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca Mexico. After presenting preliminary findings based on personal interviews with forty-two muxes and forty-eight community members, distinguishing between muxes and gays and describing the wide variation in the muxe lifestyle, the essay concludes that muxes are a third sex/gender category that is actively redoing the prevailing Western gender binary as well as traditional Mexican conceptions of gender and sexuality. They are an indigenous third sex/gender category, which is less about Western conceptions of sexuality, sexual identity, or doing transgender and more about retaining the language, cultural categories, practices, and worldviews of indigenous communities.
Communication	This article examines radio information in Italy. A quantitative content analysis was performed of the news editions of the main national broadcasters that transmit mainly informational content (RTL 102.5, Radio24, RAI Radio1, Radio Capital), as well as a regional broadcaster with a strong focus on information (Radio Popolare) and a national network whose informational spaces are minimal due to target and format (Radio 105). The study sampled one week of broadcasting from these radio stations, for a total of 1008 hours, from 23 to 29 January 2012. Results show how information in Italy is highly focused on internal politics and news stories, pushing news from abroad to the fringes and confirming the image of a nation that is little interested in what occurs outside its borders.
Ethics	"This article presents a principle identifying a form of internally conditional moral obligation concerning reliance. The need for internal conditionality arises from the generality of the concept of reliance, together with the thesis that ""obligated' implies 'can"". The principle's conditions include matters upstream from the reliant action (e.g. its being intentionally caused), downstream (harm), and concomitant with it (e.g. the absence of certain adversarial relationships). An epistemic condition straddles those categories. The principle is defended against objections, including the claims that it breaks the link between obligation and action and that reliance is normatively redundant. The principle may be derived from various moral theories, possibly via intermediate principles about harm, respect for autonomy, and the promotion of cooperation. Contrasts are drawn between moral and legal reliance-related obligations."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Under the influence of regulatory requirements, REITs hve evolved into entities that have distinct financial and organizational characteristics from their C-Corporation counterparts. This study aims to investigate whether hotel REITs are more profitable than hotel C-Corps and how REIT regulations contribute to this difference. The results indicate that despite the differences in tax obligation, operating expense, and dividend policy, hotel REITs and hotel C-Corporations are not significantly different in profitability. However, the analysis suggests that hotel C-Corps have advantage over hotel REITs in improving profitability through divident payout increases. The findings also suggest a possible non-linear relationship between profitability and divident payout, presenting an opportunity to extent Jensen's (1986) agency cost theory. (C) Elsevier Ltd.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Herbal medicine has long been contrasted to modern medicine in terms of a holistic approach to healing, vitalistic theories of health and illness, and an emphasis on the body's innate self-healing capacities. At the same time, since the early twentieth century, the cultivation, preparation and mass production of herbal medicines have become increasingly industrialized, scientificized and commercialized. What is more, phytochemical efforts to identify and isolate particular 'active ingredients' from whole-plant extracts have intensified, often in response to increasing regulatory scrutiny of the safety and quality of herbal medicinal products. In this article, I examine whether describing these developments in terms of a biomedical 'colonization' of herbal medicine, as has been common, allows us to sufficiently account for the mundane collaborative efforts of herbalists, botanists, phytochemists, pharmacologists, toxicologists and clinicians to standardize and develop certain herbal remedies. By focusing on recent efforts to industrialize and scientifically develop a 'Western' (St John's Wort) and a Vietnamese (Heantos) herbal remedy, I suggest that herbal medicine has come to be not so much colonized as normalized, with herbalists, phytochemists and pharmacologists working to develop standardized production procedures, as well as to identify 'plausible' explanations for the efficacy of these remedies.
Business	Legal rules and the economic environment play an important role in the decision to become an entrepreneur. Many studies examine the effect of such institutions at the national or state level. The metropolitan area may be a more appropriate geography to examine, since entrepreneurs often serve a more localized market and there is wide variation in both the environment for and incidence of proprietorship among metropolitan areas. We find that proprietorship increases with home equity, intangible wealth, unemployment, relative earnings of proprietors, and population. It decreases with higher state income tax rates and minimum wages.
History Of Social Sciences	Both the savings and loans (S&L) crisis of the late 1980s and the more recent subprime mortgage crisis left physical residues in the built landscape of American cities. With the crises, communities that had been the sites of speculative growth became sites of vacant properties, foreclosed properties, unimproved subdivisions, and razed structures. This paper considers the legacy of one such episode of urban development preceding the S&L crisis along Interstate 30 Garland, Texas, where criminals took advantage of deregulation and lax local planning policies to hastily construct a condominium glut. The central argument of the paper is that regional policies fostering outward growth coupled with federal policies stimulating extreme boom and bust cycles have created brief periods in which American Sunbelt communities experience growth pressures, which harnessed incorrectly have created the danger of a one strike, you're out' scenario: a single chance to succeed or fail.
Environmental Studies	The relationship between water scarcity and water use efficiency is widely disputed, and despite considerable work on the topic, little attention has been paid to their spatial relationships. Using a host of spatial analyses, a variety of spatial correlations between water scarcity and water use efficiency from 2003 to 2013 in China are examined at local to national scales. The bivariate Global Spatial Autocorrelation indicates significant (p < 0.001) positive spatial correlation between water scarcity and water use efficiency across all regions with bivariate Moran's I > 0. The bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis shows significant (p < 0.05) high water scarcity and high water use efficiency correlations with regional clustering in northern China, centering on Beijing, and low water scarcity and low water use efficiency regional clustering in southern China, centering on Hunan. The coefficients of our Spatial Lag Model show that both water scarcity and water use efficiency have significant inherent spatial dependence (p < 0.01), but no significant causal mechanisms (p > 0.1) between them were found. We discuss the implications of influencing factors including (1) the geographical agglomeration in economics, population and freshwater supplies, (2) physical and virtual water transfer, and (3) technology and water resources management to such strong spatial patterns of water use and efficiency. This study affirms the need to pay attention to water use management and efficiency improvements together in scarce environments and especially within a geographic context.
Education, Special	Internationally there are increasing numbers of young people on the ASD spectrum attending higher education. Early transition planning is essential and students with ASD often require support to articulate their post-school educational goals and actively participate in transition planning meetings. Services within higher education are primarily designed to provide academic supports however, non-academic supports may be an even more crucial factor in enabling successful transitions for young people on the ASD spectrum who often experience heightened anxiety within an unfamiliar environment. Within this paper, the results of a small-scale exploratory study of the transition experiences of six young people on the ASD spectrum to post-secondary education will be shared. There was limited evidence that transition planning had been initiated as a formal process for the six students. Accessing support in higher education proved to be a complex process for some students who required sustained input from parents to ensure that they would utilise the supports available. Encouraging the development of self-determination skills, a key predictor of success in higher education, needs to begin in secondary school. It is anticipated insights from this study can contribute to the development of an embedded infrastructure to support effective transitions for students with ASD to post-secondary education.
Education, Special	Functional communication training (FCT) is one of the most common treatments for challenging behavior and is considered an empirically supported practice for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, no previous systematic review has evaluated the quality of FCT for adults with ASD, and the empirical support for this practice among adults is unknown. The purpose of the current review was to synthesize the extant research, including a quality appraisal of the literature on the use of FCT to treat challenging behavior for adults with ASD. We identified 20 studies that evaluated the efficacy of FCT in reducing challenging behavior for adults with ASD. The quality of each article was evaluated based on the What Works Clearinghouse design and evidence standards. Following the quality and evidence evaluations, eight studies, including eight experiments, were found to have moderate or strong evidence of effectiveness. The current body of literature provides some evidence for the efficacy of FCT in reducing challenging behavior for adults with ASD, but additional research in this area is warranted.
Ethnic Studies	This paper is about linguistic justice issues in the post-colonial context of an Irish-speaking region in the south-west of Ireland, drawing on a study of political mobilization around the Irish-medium education policy of the region's secondary school. I explore how the incipient Irish state was involved in a nationalizing project of developing strategies to constitute the Irish polity into a particular nation bound by an language of 'archaic belonging'. I then examine how this nationalizing project was disrupted by structural shifts in the economic and demographic basis for the Irish-speaking communities on the Irish western seaboard. It is in this historical context that the Irish language emerges as a necessary nodal point around which political identity is formed. Local linguistic struggles are conceived as attempts to impose particular kinds of order on a field of meaning.
Social Issues	In this article, I draw on historical and conceptual arguments to show, first, that disenchantment and the influential view of the relationship between science and religion to which disenchantment gives rise are rooted in the metaphysics of theism. I then introduce the alternative metaphysical position of panentheism and identify Jungian psychology as an important, if implicit, mid-twentieth-century instance of panentheistic thought. Using the example of Jungian psychology, I demonstrate how the viewpoint of panentheism undoes the implications of disenchantment for the relationship between science and religion, promoting greater opportunities for dialogue and reconciliation between science and religion. I note, however, that these closer relations may depend on understanding science and religion differently from how they are understood under disenchantment. While the original tension between science and religion is eased, another tensionbetween panentheistic and disenchanted understandings of science and religionis exposed. I conclude by reflecting on some implications of this discussion for sociology.
Geography	This paper builds on an emergent scholarly interest in the political geography of the contemporary city. If recent struggles over the meaning of urban space testify to the interarticulation of neo-liberal norms with an increasingly revanchist approach to local governance, the main aim of the paper is to acknowledge various attempts to contest these developments. More specifically, it seeks to highlight the role and significance of the German Hausbesetzerbewegung (squatter movement) from the 1960s onwards. Despite a growing body of literature on the role of '1968' as a watershed moment in the evolution of new social movements in West Germany, there remains little empirical work on the role of squatter movements within a broader matrix of protest and resistance. To what extent was the squatter movement in West Germany successful in articulating a creative reworking of the built form and urban space more generally? In what way were these counterclaims to the city performed? And how were these alternative cartographies organised at the level of the everyday? The paper proposes to answer these framing questions with particular reference to Berlin's squatting scene and longstanding struggles since the late 1960s over architectural space, ecological practice and 'insurgent' forms of citizenship.
Gerontology	ObjectivesTo conduct a cost analysis of ambient assisted living technology, which is promising for improving the ability of individuals and care providers to monitor daily activities and gain better awareness through proactive management of health and safety. DesignThree-arm cohort study. SettingHomes of enrollees of a state-based healthcare plan for older adults. ParticipantsEnrollees dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (N=268). InterventionHealth and safety passive remote patient monitoring (PRPM) systems were installed in enrollees' homes (the intervention group) with monitoring and proactive intervention of a case manager when deviation from baseline subject behavior was detected. MeasurementsClaims data were collected over 12months to assess healthcare use and costs in the intervention group and to compare use and costs with those of two control groups: a concurrent group of enrollees who declined the technology and a historical cohort matched on age to the participation group. ResultsAlthough the small sample size precluded cost differences that were statistically significant, the participant group used substantially less custodial care, emergency department (ED) services, inpatient stays, and ED costs than the two control groups. ConclusionIn this pilot study, the PRPM system was associated with apparent healthcare cost savings. Although more cost analyses are warranted, ambient assisted living technologies are a potentially valuable investment for older adult care.
Social Issues	Mutual critique by scientists and religious believers mostly entails the pruning of untenable religious beliefs by scientists and warnings against scientific minimalism on the part of believers. John F. Haught has been prominent in formulating religious apologetics in response to the challenges posed by evolutionary theory. Haught's work also resonates with a parallel criticism of the conventional scientific metaphysics undergirding neo-Darwinian theory. Contemporary systems ecology seems to indicate that nothing short of a complete reversal of the Enlightenment assumptions about nature is capable of repositioning science to deal adequately with the origin and dynamics of living systems. A process-based alternative metaphysics substantially mitigates several ostensible conflicts between science and religion.
Public Administration	This article analyzes, from the organization learning and institutional change perspectives, the crisis created by the suspension of Mexico City's Metro line 12. What are the main learnings that could be derived from a complex and controversial event such as the interruption of line 12? To what extent a crisis like this can bring about useful institutional changes to deal with similar situations? I argue that the learning opportunities and institutional changes of a government that undergoes a severe crisis are scarce, mainly because reliable information regarding facts, causes and responsibilities is frequently absent. The article reviews two rival analytical perspectives that try to explain to what extent the emergence of critical events yield learning and substantial policy changes.
Anthropology	In this paper I propose a novel integration of inductive predictive modelling and ethnoarchaeology. The case study concerns seasonal upland pastoral settlement patterns in the eastern Italian Alps. A sample of modern pastoral sites has been selected, and their relationships with environmental variables have been analyzed in order to create a model to predict the location of archaeological upland pastoral sites. The model has been tested with modern and archaeological control samples. It has proved to be useful for predicting the location of specific site categories. Ethnoarchaeological fieldwork has been carried out in the same alpine sample area, which has enhanced the interpretative potential of the proposed model, suggesting that the spatial of the analyzed sites could well be related to their dairying function. The creation of ethnoarchaeological locational models with a predictive potential may be very important not only in helping to tackle some theoretical and methodological problems in predictive modelling, but also in enhancing the importance of ethnoarchaeology in landscape archaeology projects.

Political Science	"We document a large and consequential bias in how Americans perceive the major political parties: people tend to considerably overestimate the extent to which party supporters belong to party-stereotypical groups. For instance, people think that 32% of Democrats are LGBT (vs. 6% in reality) and 38% of Republicans earn over $250,000 per year (vs. 2% in reality). Experimental data suggest that these misperceptions are genuine and party specific, not artifacts of expressive responding, innumeracy, or ignorance of base rates. These misperceptions are widely shared, though bias in out-party perceptions is larger. Using observational and experimental data, we document the consequences of this perceptual bias. Misperceptions about out-party composition are associated with partisan affect, beliefs about out-party extremity, and allegiance to one""s own party. When provided information about the out-party""s actual composition, partisans come to see its supporters as less extreme and feel less socially distant from them."
Women'S Studies	Formal support providers can play a critical role in sexual assault survivors' well-being (e.g., providing resource referrals). In a university setting, resident assistants (RAs) are key support providers with a unique relationship to survivors based on their dual roles as help-provider and peer. We examined 305 RAs' responses to student sexual assault disclosure scenarios. Employing a critical discourse analysis, we identified four discourses used by RAs in their discussion of resources: controlling, gatekeeping, minimizing, and empowering. Due to power dynamics between RAs and residents, we conclude that empowering discourses would facilitate survivors' access to other resources (e.g., sexual assault center).
Information Science & Library Science	"It has been widely acknowledged recently that the research field of eParticipation suffers from lack of comprehensive theoretical contributions, insufficient depth, and inconsistency in definitions of central concepts. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field researchers find it difficult to consolidate their theoretical groundwork and further theory building in the eParticipation domain. This paper reports a literature study of conceptual publications on the subject of eParticipation/eDemocracy in the time frame of 2007-2009. Its objectives are to track recent theoretical development in the field, to reveal constraints and limitations to researching the area, and to offer some suggestions for further inquiry. The results show that most theories currently used in conceptual eParticipation research originate from the fields of Political Science and Media and Communication Studies. But together with this, contemporary eParticipation authors contribute to strengthening the field with some ""in-house"" models and frameworks as well. Central problems with eParticipation research concern immaturity of the field, topical gaps, and biased assumptions. The review shows that the themes of recent publications can be grouped into three major categories: stakeholders, environment, and applications and tools. It also finds some interconnections between these categories; however, in general the coupling technology-stakeholders-(participatory) environments is weak. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Social Issues	When Darwin's theory of natural selection threatened to put Paley's Designer out of a job, one response was to reemploy God as the author of the evolutionary process itself. This idea requires an account of how God might be understood to act in biological history. I approach this question in two stages: first, by considering God's action as creator of the world as a whole, and second, by exploring the idea of particular divine action in the course of evolution. As creator ex nihilo God acts directly in every event as its sustaining ground. Because God structures the world as a lawful order of natural causes, God also acts indirectly by means of creatures. More controversially, God might act directly within the world to affect the course of events; this action need not take the form of a miraculous intervention, if the natural order includes the right sort of indeterministic chance. In each of these ways God's purposes can shape evolutionary processes.
International Relations	In this short article, the authors analyse the implications of the election of Donald Trump for the future of the liberal rules-based order, with specific emphasis on its implications for the Asian region. Departing from the institutional fetishism that figures prominently in the literature, the authors argue that this liberal order needs to be conceptualised in terms of its social foundations. Particularly important to consider, in terms of understanding these social foundations, is the nature of social relations in the USA. The election of Trump reflects the deep crisis of the US state and the rise of a new authoritarian populism'. The authors trace the roots of this authoritarian populism to patterns of global capitalist transformation, the crisis of the US state and the modes of crisis management that this has generated. They then explore the implications of Trump's authoritarian populism for the region.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	. We use univariate and multivariate singular spectrum analyses to predict the rate of inflation as well as changes in the direction of inflation time series for the USA. We use consumer price indices and realtime chain-weighted gross domestic product price index series in these prediction exercises. Moreover, we compare our out-of-sample, h-step-ahead moving prediction results with other prediction results based on methods such as the activity-based non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment Phillips curve, auto-regressive AR(p) model, the dynamic factors model and random-walk models with the last as a naive forecasting method. We use short-run (quarterly) and long-run (16 years) time windows for predictions and find that multivariate singular spectrum analysis outperforms all other competing prediction methods. Also, we confirm the results of earlier studies that prediction of the rate of inflation in the USA during the period of the Great Moderation' is less challenging compared with the more volatile inflationary period of 19701985.
Area Studies	Being founded in the wake of the First World War, both Turkey and the Soviet Union followed revolutionary modernizing pathways. At the outset, one could trace many similar patterns in their radical modernization paradigms; however, their development models as well as political and social orders were radically distinct, which became more obvious with the passage of time. The paper discusses the external interpretations of Kemalism by observing the Soviet perspectives on the inception and evolution of Kemalism. Paying more attention to diplomatic, geopolitical and economic complexities of the Turkish-Soviet relations, scholars have rarely problematized the Soviet Union perceptions of Turkish ideological transformations. In reality, since the early 1920s, different state institutions, intellectual schools of thought and research in the Soviet Union closely observed the domestic transformations in Turkey by providing valuable insights on the perspective and the implications of the Kemalist transformation. The article also looks at the question of how the incorporation of Soviet perspectives can enrich the historiography and our understanding of Kemalism.
Linguistics	This study compares the effects of processing instruction (PI), structured input (SI), and form-related explicit information (FREI) on a primary target form (i.e., third-person Spanish accusative clitics) and on a secondary form (i.e., third-person Spanish dative clitics). Participants included 151 adult learners enrolled in a beginning-level Spanish course. Findings revealed that SI is as effective on the primary target form as PI immediately after treatment; however, the FREI component of PI may play a positive role at the delayed posttest, as exhibited by the fact that the PI group maintained gains, whereas the SI group, although improved from the pretest, did not. Learners exposed to both PI and SI also demonstrated gains on the secondary target form, which suggests a transfer-of-training effect for both interventions. As such, we discuss the theoretical and methodological ramifications of these findings.
Economics	This article studies the performance of different modelling strategies for 969 and 600 monthly price indexes disaggregated by sectors and geographical areas in Spain, regions and in the Euro Area 12 (EA12) countries. We also provide, by means of spatial bi-dimensional vector equilibrium correction models for all pairs of prices between neighbours, a description of spatial cointegration restrictions that could be useful for understanding price setting within an economy. We study the relevance of the regional disaggregation by using the proposed models to forecast the corresponding headline inflation and testing whether it is more accurate than alternative forecasts based on aggregated models. The results for Spain show that this is the case. Country disaggregation forecasts are also reliable for the EA12, but only because derived headline inflation forecasting is not significantly worse than alternative forecasts. The models in this article can be used for competitive analysis and other macro and regional analysis.
Ethics	Alexandru Dragomir became widely known in Romania as a philosopher 2 years after his death, in 2004. He had no prior publications and only a few of his close acquaintances were even aware of his work as a thinker. The editors of the five volumes of his posthumous papers have from the onset tried to present Dragomir, a former doctoral student of Heidegger, as a phenomenologist, while this interpretation is today well-established. The following paper tries to submit this interpretation to a closer scrutiny, on the one hand, by addressing the history of Dragomir's publication and reception in Romania and abroad, and on the other hand, by analyzing several aspects of his oeuvre which do indeed hold close resemblance to aspects of the phenomenological method, even though they actually have quite different motivations.
Management	This paper provides an overview of the state of art of research on social entrepreneurship and the establishment of this topic in the academic world, It uses scientometric methods in measuring the maturity of social entrepreneurship research. The empirical part reveals the exponentially growing number of papers, the institutionalization of social entrepreneurship in seven dimensions the emergence of thematic clusters, and methodological issues. The paper makes concrete suggestions on how to overcome methodological challenges. Furthermore, we provide a ranking of the 22 most cited academic contributions in social entrepreneurship. Surprisingly, almost half of the most cited papers have not been published in journals but in books, raising doubts about the current (over-)rating of journal publications.
Women'S Studies	This article discusses contemporary feminist online activism by means of case studies on feminist hashtags, which address sexism and sexualized violence, as well as feminist blogs. Feminist empowerment, however, has been met on the Internet by an anti-feminism, which has also found new forms of expression and communication channels online. By using examples, this contribution demonstrates how antifeminist forms of action can be responded with feminist counter narratives and how defensive strategies can thus be used to reclaim publics.
Social Work	The year 2006 marked the 30th anniversary of the publication of Michael Rutter and Nicola Madge's Cycles of Disadvantage (1976). As such, it provides an opportunity to take stock of debates over an alleged cycle of deprivation, both in the 1970s, and more recently. This article seeks to use historical methods in order to outline some areas in which a historical perspective can add significantly to existing knowledge on this topic of enduring interest. In particular, it explores five myths or misconceptions: firstly, that we know the origins of the cycle of deprivation hypothesis, secondly, that we know what happened in the course of the Research Programme, thirdly, that the Department of Health and Social Security supported the research; fourthly, that social scientists were interested in the cycle hypothesis and lastly, that there has been significant progress since 1976.

Education & Educational Research	This article introduces the notion of justice-sensitive education' - derived from the ideals and practices of transitional justice (TJ) in countries emerging from conflict. It describes three mechanisms for this: structural reforms (relating to inequity and division); curriculum change (the treatment of history, human rights and citizenship) and institutional culture (critical thinking and democratic, participatory pedagogy). A case study of Sri Lanka provides fresh illustrations of actual or potential work in these three areas. There appear five challenges to a justice-sensitive education: the wider context of schooling; willingness of educators to confront the past; barriers to introducing the critical thinking required for new norms and values to take root; programming and planning; and difficulties in measuring the impact of TJ measures in education. Yet however imperfect, TJ mechanisms indicate a society that wants to learn from past mistakes and show that some form of justice is possible in the future.
Public Administration	This paper reviews NHS England's recent report on the formula that guides the allocation of tens of billions of pounds to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). It finds deficiencies and errors in the unprincipled construction of the formula and substitutes Sir Francis Galton's logical concept of regression to the mean' for the report's ad hoc conjectures about striking patterns of certain coefficients.
Family Studies	Self-efficacy - the belief in one's capability to cope with life's challenges and achieve goals - is an important service objective in family centered practice with parents of children with disability. Yet, limited attention has been given to parental self-efficacy and overall adjustment of families of children with a disability in the research literature. This study explores maternal general self-efficacy as a cognitive coping resource in these families. We employed longitudinal tracking over a 1-year period to examine maternal general self-efficacy as a predictor of family adjustment in households with children with serious disability. A computer assisted telephone survey gathered psychological, family, and demographic information from 154 mothers in AB, Canada. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that even when controlling for family adjustment at time I, as well as mother's age and parenting stress at time 2, general self-efficacy made an independent contribution to predicting family adjustment at time 2.
Environmental Studies	Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) is an important tool for conservation and achieving sustainable development. 'Significant' impacts are those which disturb or alter the environment to a measurable degree. Significance is a crucial part of EcIA, our understanding of the concept in practice is vital if it is to be effective as a tool. This study employed three methods to assess how the determination of significance has changed through time, what current practice is, and what would lead to future improvements. Three data streams were collected: interviews with expert stakeholders. a review of 30 Environmental Statements and a broad-scale survey of the United Kingdom Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM) members. The approach taken in the determination of significance has become more standardised and subjectivity has become constrained through a transparent framework. This has largely been driven by a set of guidelines produced by IEEM in 2006. The significance of impacts is now more clearly justified and the accuracy with which it is determined has improved. However, there are limitations to accuracy and effectiveness of the determination of significance. These are the quality of baseline survey data, our scientific understanding of ecological processes and the lack of monitoring and feedback of results. These in turn are restricted by the limited resources available in consultancies. The most notable recommendations for future practice are the implementation of monitoring and the publication of feedback, the creation of a central database for baseline survey data and the streamlining of guidance.

Ethnic Studies	"Over the past quarter of a century a pronounced immigrant continental African Muslim presence has manifested itself in New York City. Their roots can be traced back at least two centuries in the Empire State's major city, since at least the landing of the slave schooner Amistad in 1839. African American descendants of Muslim African captives during the Atlantic Slave Trade, like Henry Highland Garnett, lived in upstate New York and made great historical contributions there. Following the Civil War and after the Great Black Migration northward from numerous Southern cities, several Black American groups identifying themselves as Muslims established themselves in New York's Harlem, and other Northern cities with major Black populations. Collectively, they laid the foundation for the major Muslim presence today in what has been called ""the Mecca of Black America.''"
Industrial Relations & Labor	The 2007-09 recession had a more negative impact on employment in retail trade than did previous recessions; job losses accelerated during the second half of the 18-month
Law	Implicit in the company laws of common law jurisdictions is the notion of the corporate veil and the insulation of company shareholders from liability for debts of the company. The veil is not sacrosanct, however, and in appropriate circumstances courts will allow company creditors to pierce the veil and recover debts of the company directly from its shareholders. In contrast, the company legislation of China, supplemented by quasi-legislative rulings by the Supreme People's Court, provides company creditors with an explicit right to pierce the corporate veil and pursue shareholders for satisfaction of company debts. While the rate of corporate veil piercing in China is much higher than that of other countries, as a previous study has found for the years 2006-2010 and which this study shows has continued in the years 2011-2014, it is not entirely clear that the difference is attributable only to the use of statutory remedies in preference to judicial doctrines used elsewhere. The result might also be a consequence of judicial interpretations of the law that go well beyond its literal and intended scope.
Education, Special	"Many teachers state that disruptive behavior in their classroom is one of their main challenges, and it often results in a loss of instructional time. Teachers also have difficulty in providing opportunities for their students to be actively engaged in their own learning. This study used an ABAB reversal design to investigate the effects of preprinted response cards on students"" participation and disruptive behavior in a fourth-grade inclusive elementary classroom during language arts instruction. The findings of this study showed that the use of preprinted response cards resulted in increased participation for all five target students. Limitations of the study, areas for future research to investigate, and implications for practice are discussed."
Anthropology	Heat treatment of silcrete was a major innovation in the southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA). It allowed for the first time to improve materials for tool knapping, and it may have represented an important step in the perception of natural resources as modifiable objects. Recognising heat treatment in silcrete assemblages is therefore a crucial step for archaeologists working on the MSA. Two different methods, gloss analysis and visual estimation of surface roughness, have so far been used to identify heat treatment. Although both methods have advantages in specific situations, only visual heating proxy classifications allow to count heated vs. not-heated artefacts in assemblages. However, no objective independent data on the reliability and reproducibility of visual classifications are available today. This paper presents a new and promising non-destructive way to measure surface roughness and to verify the reliability of visual classifications: the replica tape method. The results show a rather good reliability of visual classifications: only few pieces are misclassified (n = 3), and the results of both replica tape measurements and visual classification agree within a 3% error range. These results also lay out the foundations for future developments of replica tape measurements to make it a stand-alone method for identifying heat treatment within silcrete assemblages.
Substance Abuse	Aims: Knowledge of public opinion towards drug policy is often limited to analyses of individual survey questions. There has been less thought given to the underlying structure of public opinion, and how attitudes towards different facets of drug policy, for example, law enforcement and harm reduction, might align into ideological positions. This paper aims to assess the extent to which distinct ideologies are present among the general public in Australia in relation to drug policy. Method: The study involved a Latent Class Analysis of data taken from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. The analysis categorized individuals into mutually exclusive groups (classes), according to their responses to 15 attitudinal items. Findings: Six classes of individuals were identified, and were labelled as: uninformed, ambivalent, detached prohibitionists, committed prohibitionists, harm reductionists and legalizers. Conclusions: The unique analysis presented in this paper demonstrates the existence of six distinct classes of opinions towards drug policy in an Australian sample. Whilst there were a large proportion of respondents in support of both drug legalization and harm reduction, there were also many who opposed drug legalization, yet supported harm reduction. Any assumption that supporting harm reduction automatically equates with support for legalization, is erroneous.
Demography	Beginning in 2000, in economically advanced countries, a remarkable bifurcation in fertility levels has emerged, with one group in the moderate range of period total fertility rates, about 1.9, and the other at 1.3. The upper branch consists of countries in Northern and Western Europe, Oceania and the United States; the lower branch includes Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe, and East and Southeast Asia. A review of the major theories for low-fertility countries reveals that none of them would have predicted this specific bifurcation. We argue that those countries with fertility levels close to replacement level have institutional arrangements, and related policies, that make it easier, not easy, for women to combine the worker and mother roles. The institutional details are quite different across countries, suggesting that multiple combinations of institutional arrangements and policies can lead to the same country-level fertility outcome. Canada, the only exception to this bifurcation, illustrates the importance of the different institutional structures in Quebec compared to the rest of Canada.
History	"This paper deals with the making of vagrancy in the context of early state welfare policy. Vagrancy is neither understood as an anachronism nor as deviance or marginality. Rather, it raises central questions concerning social policy and the history of labour. Starting from the problems of definition in the context of contemporary transnational debates, I will then focus on the practical implementation of distinctions in Austria from the late nineteenth century to the Anschluss in 1938. Different practices of varying efficacy will be accounted for, starting with the first attempts to formalize unemployment emerging in the late nineteenth century, when, based on a new understanding of unemployment as an effect of the labour market, new forms of supporting and regulating those wayfarers in search of employment were established. Such practices also aimed at outlawing vagrancy, with consistent penalties under the law. In addition, vagrancy will be discussed with respect to changing political regimes. Focusing on the 1920s and 1930s, the paper analyses crime statistics and crime records, and last but not least, the perspective of those who were ""on the tramp''."
Social Work	A large percentage of professionals, including social workers, practise in a country other than where they obtained their professional qualification. Reasons for migration have been well documented and vary by country and population. Common migrating factors for social workers include employment challenges and opportunities related to the aging population, increased government expenditure on health and social care services, and insufficient numbers of new graduates entering the profession. This article draws on research about the experiences of migrant social workers in New Zealand. It highlights this population's perceptions of the status of social work as a profession and their own professional identity. The study utilised a combination of qualitative and quantitative strategies in a three-phased project. The findings provide insights into the nature of the transitional experience for migrant professionals and new vantage points on views of social work as practised in different contexts. We identified perceptions reflecting what we term 'enduring professional dislocation', and argue that maintaining a broad view of social work is the foundation for understanding the profession in a new country. We advocate for strategies to facilitate migrant social workers' adjustment to a new setting, especially where some degree of social and cultural contextualisation in social work practice is required.
Information Science & Library Science	PEDSnet is a clinical data research network (CDRN) that aggregates electronic health record data from multiple children's hospitals to enable large-scale research. Assessing data quality to ensure suitability for conducting research is a key requirement in PEDSnet. This study presents a range of data quality issues identified over a period of 18 months and interprets them to evaluate the research capacity of PEDSnet. Results were generated by a semiautomated data quality assessment workflow. Two investigators reviewed programmatic data quality issues and conducted discussions with the data partners' extract-transform-load analysts to determine the cause for each issue. The results include a longitudinal summary of 2182 data quality issues identified across 9 data submission cycles. The metadata from the most recent cycle includes annotations for 850 issues: most frequent types, including missing data (> 300) and outliers (> 100); most complex domains, including medications (> 160) and lab measurements (> 140); and primary causes, including source data characteristics (83%) and extract-transform-load errors (9%). The longitudinal findings demonstrate the network's evolution from identifying difficulties with aligning the data to a common data model to learning norms in clinical pediatrics and determining research capability. While data quality is recognized as a critical aspect in establishing and utilizing a CDRN, the findings from data quality assessments are largely unpublished. This paper presents a real-world account of studying and interpreting data quality findings in a pediatric CDRN, and the lessons learned could be used by other CDRNs.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Roy Sorensen introduced the concept of an epistemic blindspot in the 1980s. A proposition is an epistemic blindspot for some individual at some time if and only if that proposition is consistent but unknowable by that individual at that time. In the first half of this paper, I extend Sorensen work on blindspots by arguing that there exist blindspots that essentially involve hopes. In the second half, I show how such blindspots can contribute to and impair different pursuits of self-understanding. My arguments throughout this paper draw on Luc Bovens's account of hope.
Education, Special	This study provides results on a methodological quality review of the single-case research literature from 1998 to 2014 on the use of social skills interventions for students with challenging behavior. A systematic review of the social skills literature was conducted with the intent of updating the Mathur et al. study of social skills interventions. Twenty-four studies, published between 1998 and 2014, were identified and coded for methodological quality. Findings indicated half the studies failed to meet single-case design standards. Many studies did not sufficiently report reliability, implementation fidelity, or provide adequate opportunities to demonstrate intervention effect. The three most common behaviors across all studies were noncompliance, negative verbal interactions, and class disruptions. The majority of studies were conducted in early elementary grades. Results are discussed in the context of the need for greater methodological rigor for future single-case research studies in the area of social skills instruction.
Urban Studies	Although researchers have made progress in understanding motivations behind local government collaboration, there is little research that explores the spatial dynamics of such interactions. Does the idea of collaboration travel horizontally, passed from neighbor to neighbor, or is vertical leadership from state, county, or regional actors more important in influencing local governments' decisions to share resources and functions? What factors influence local governments' choices to collaborate with their neighbors versus a regional entity, county, or state government? In this article, we investigate the importance of vertical and horizontal influences when local governments decide to collaborate around land use planning. Using data from a survey of Michigan local government officials, we take a spatial statistical approach to answering this question. We find widespread evidence of collaboration at multiple scales, and observe patterns of both horizontal and vertical influence. We also find that contextual factors help to explain these patterns of collaboration.
Business, Finance	"We report evidence that the UK dividend yield and expected inflation are positively correlated from 1962 to 1997, but negatively correlated subsequently. Using a commonly used VAR (vector auto-regression)-based procedure we find strong evidence that the positive correlation is caused both by inflation illusion and the effect of inflation on required rates of return. We also find some evidence that it is caused by inflation rationally reducing expected real dividend growth. We find that Chen and Zhao's (2009. ""Return Decomposition."" Review of Financial Studies 22 (12): 5213-5249) criticism of the VAR-based procedure has little empirical relevance but that the procedure can be highly sensitive to the choice of data period."
History Of Social Sciences	Diagonal street orientations in urban Europe were cut through the crust of the ancient city by popes, monarchs and governments to create a network of voided lines and points which injected the city with new levels of functionality and legibility for a particular regime. In the Anglo-Colonial New World, the grid was the dominant plan form with diagonals emerging only occasionally, as gestures of projected urban grandeur, geometric whimsy or vigorous boosterism. Despite inauspicious beginnings in Auckland in 1841, diagonal planning became a feature of a number of New Zealand's cities and towns. The research methodology privileges the autonomy of visual language as a critical component of the economy of knowledge(1) and focuses on primary archival graphic material from the Alexander Turnbull Library, and the National Archives in Wellington. The paper surveys the development of diagonal plans across settlements in late nineteenth century New Zealand and, with reference to examples in the USA, identifies the typologies of, and motivations behind, diagonal planning in this context.
Communication	Recent advances in partisan selective exposure research have provided compelling evidence for the distinction between selective approach and selective avoidance. Yet the questions of whether, how, and to what extent discrete emotions systematically shape either of these patterns has not been sufficiently addressed. This study explores the differential roles of fear, anger, and enthusiasm in selective approach to and selective avoidance of partisan news programs, focusing on partisan differences in regard to a person's general approach versus avoidance tendencies to external stimuli as a possible moderating mechanism. A secondary analysis of the 2012 American National Election Studies data suggested that fear and anger both significantly increased proattitudinal news exposure, whereas only anger decreased counterattitudinal news exposure. In addition, Republicans exhibit these patterns to a greater extent than Democrats. Furthermore, enthusiasm significantly predicted exposure to proattitudinal news for both Republicans and Democrats, whereas Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to increase their counterattitudinal news exposure as a function of enthusiasm. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.
Cultural Studies	"Bound in the same codex as Beowulf, the Wonders of the East manuscript features a compendium of fantastical hybrid creatures still loosely classified as ""men."" Previous scholarly conversations about hermaphroditism in the text have either focused on the Wonders' masculinized female races or on illustrations of creatures that appear to feature ambiguous genitalia. I will instead make a case for re-evaluating the Donestre: a creature that has been generally understood to be male, but which shows subtle signs of being intersex. The creature's sexual indeterminacy appears to be linked to its cannibal diet, as it is implied to absorb parts of the bodies and identities of its prey. The Donestre's status as an intersexed assemblage of bodies also presents a spiritual conundrum: what happens to the souls of those it devours? Using the Nowell codex as a case study, I demonstrate how the implications of the Donestre episode in Wonders challenges narratives of bodily death and spiritual ascension advanced in several of its accompanying texts, including Beowulf. When read against Beowulf in particular, the Donestre episode from The Wonders of the East emphasizes the cannibal queerness of Grendel and his dam, so that their monstrous bodies also elicit questions about the disintegration of the self and the nature of the relationship between body and soul(s)."
History	This paper explores Victorian culture's persistent associations between epilepsy and bodily expenditure to locate the place of the epileptic body within the Victorian 'libidinal economy'. It centres on a reading of Wilkie Collins's Poor Miss Finch (1872) as a highly original meditation on the implications of disability and visibility. In this novel, a reclusive silversmith named Oscar Dubourg curbs his post-traumatic seizures with silver nitrate, a remedy that causes a dark-blue discoloration of the skin. Behind the narrative necessity of this device, I locate an epistemological desire to render the condition of epilepsy visibly evident by saturating (and implicitly racializing) Oscar so that the inside shows through. The sporadic visibility of epilepsy confers a radically unstable identity upon its sufferer, one represented by the fluidity and anonymity of the unshaped silver and gold plates that Oscar moulds in his workshop. These plates inspire rumours throughout the community that Oscar is a counterfeiter. Oscar's valuable metals, along with his health, are stolen in one fell swoop; the thieves brutally attack him, precipitating his traumatic epilepsy. The silver does not disappear, then, but is transmuted into Oscar's affliction; these shifting metaphorical values of silver can be productively read in light of Victorian discourses of pathology, not least the widespread concern about malingerers 'counterfeiting' epilepsy. Can an afflicted body 'pass' as healthy? Can healthy bodies perform affliction? These are questions that Oscar's story raises, with the help of a twin brother who exchanges identities with him in order to retain his fiancee's affections. Collins's sensational marriage plot, peopled with a cast of 'problem bodies', pulls the novel into critical conversation with a nexus of nineteenth-century medical and eugenic discourses dedicated to the surveilling of physical difference and the 'policing' of legitimate and illegitimate disabilities.
Business	The purpose of the research is to demonstrate how recognition of complex systems or complexity science enhances recognition and achievement of entrepreneurial opportunities. A further objective is to provide an integrated source of readily available information about a number of research papers that demonstrate the role of complex systems in entrepreneurial activities. Papers reviewed include those by McKelvey, Andriani, Boisot, Dooley, Siggelkow, Chiles, Plowman, Lichtenstein, Carbonara, Crawford, and others. These papers illustrate how complex systems operate, and how this can be used to develop entrepreneurial emergence. The research also seeks to identify an integrated model of emergence to provide a framework for entrepreneurship researchers and provide assistance to entrepreneurs. Lichtenstein's Generative Emergence provides the most comprehensive model found to structure opportunity achievement. While Lichtenstein's comprehensive model has not been tested, vis-a-vis other comprehensive entrepreneurial models, the components of the model have been tested. Overall Lichtenstein's Generative Emergence model is strongly endorsed.
Environmental Studies	Property rights granted by land and water policies are not always identical with the claims-meaning perceived rights-people base their actions on. A high discrepancy between both resembles an ineffective policy implementation and bears the risk of unsustainable decision-making. Furthermore, perceived rights to land and its corresponding resource water can vary significantly. In this paper, we operationalize the property rights concepts and empirically assess, by specifying and quantifying, the difference between property rights and farmers' customary claims to both, land and water resources. With regard to land, actors tend to base their decisions on customary claims, and override property rights. In contrast, regarding water, we find that the full benefits of property rights granted by a policy reform are often not recognized. Whereas in the first case political control and monitoring mechanisms seems to fail, in the latter a lack of information sharing let the farmers not exploit their full investment potential.
Communication	This study assesses mainstream journalism's diversity measures from the perspective of minority audiences. Specifically, it focuses on Latinas/os' perceptions of the San Jose Mercury News, a paper highly regarded for its professional standards and its commitment to cultural diversity. Based on a multi-methodological approach, the study shows Latinas/os' persistent distrust of the Mercury News and how that distrust is grounded in a problem of representation. This problem of representation cannot be equated - as it is commonly done in journalism - with a mismatch between the paper's portrayal of Latinas/os and an objective reality. Latinas/os feel excluded from the Mercury News not because reporters fail to cover the community objectively. Rather, a strict compliance with professional standards of objectivity constrain the newspaper's capacity to represent, and thus to adequately serve, minority audiences. The paper concludes that journalism needs to move away from objectivist notions of representation and of cultural difference.
Economics	The paper analyses the effect of the dynamics of consumption preferences on the dynamics of macro-economic growth. We endogenously derive micro-dynamics of consumption behavior as a result of the increase in the number of income classes. The different degrees of inertia in the adjustment of consumption levels to income changes affect firm selection and the dynamics of market structure, which is ultimately responsible for different regimes of macro-economic growth. We find, first, that higher heterogeneity in consumption preferences amplifies and accelerates market dynamics, leading to a swift shift from a Malthusian to a Kaldorian growth pattern. Second, consumption smoothing mainly affects the timing of such a take-off. Inertia in consumption delays the occurrence of a Kaldorian engine for growth.
History Of Social Sciences	This article describes the planning activity in Portugal in the middle of the twentieth century, notably the work of two exceptional planners, Etienne de Groer and Antao Almeida Garrett. The article moves from a first overview on the national context, to a focus on the two largest cities of Portugal, Lisbon, and Oporto. It was there that these two planners developed their most successful planning proposals. The planning activity of de Groer and Garrett is presented, first taken in isolation and then on a comparative basis. Issues addressed include the urban structure and the organization of the city, the street layout, and the system of zoning. It is argued that de Groer municipal plan for Lisbon and Garrett municipal plan for Oporto were able to leave a profound and lasting impact on these cities, being the most influential planning documents of the twentieth century in Lisbon and in Oporto.
Linguistics	In times of crisis, comparative capitalism analysis has difficulties differentiating crisis symptoms and effects from trends that may be more long-term. In this paper, I propose that by looking at the discursive strategies of central actors within the political economy, we may improve our understanding of capitalist trajectories. Drawing on Regulation Theory and Gramsci, the main empirical argument is that the French accumulation regime and its regulation are changing to a more explicitly export-oriented and financialised capitalism. This is underscored by the political project of capital-friendly austerity corresponding to a shift in the relationship of forces, the establishment of a neoliberal understanding of competitiveness, and the fading-out of purchasing power. The theoretical contribution of the paper is to integrate more closely critical discourse analysis with a critical political economy perspective.
Area Studies	Rabindranath Tagore's visit to China in 1924 was a milestone in the May Fourth Movement's envisioning of modern literature as a vehicle for social transformation. Moving beyond interpretations of the visit as a political failure, this article locates the reception of Tagore's ideal of Eastern spirituality within the larger climate of literary production, specifically in new poetry. Through close reading of poems by Xu Zhimo and Bing Xin, this article argues that Tagore's ideas were fundamental for the development of poetry as an interpersonal medium that both portrays and effects social bonds. This understanding developed as Chinese poets and literary critics engaged with Tagore's critique of Western materialism and his positioning of Asian religious sensibilities in contrast to Western materialism. Tagore's view promoted literature as a medium connecting religion, the individual, and the universe. In this sense, though Tagore's pan-Asianism failed as a viable political project, it carried powerful resonance in the arena of modern Chinese literature.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Analysis of ordered binary and unordered binary data has received considerable attention in social and psychological research. This article introduces a Bayesian approach, which has several nice features in practical applications, for analyzing nonlinear structural equation models with dichotomous data. We demonstrate how to use the software WinBUGS and R2WinBUGS to obtain Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters, estimates of latent variables, and the Deviance Information Criterion for model comparison. An illustrative example with an artificial data set is provided. Finally, simulation studies are conducted, not only to reveal the empirical performance of the Bayesian approach, but also to show that incorrectly treating binary data as ordinal, and vice versa, would produce misleading results.
Transportation	Activity scheduling simulation models represent an emerging and proposing approach to forecasting travel demand. The most significant developmental challenge is the lack of empirical data on how people actually proceed through the scheduling and conflict resolution process. This paper develops a new methodology to collect data about the rescheduling decision process. The data collection involves six stages: preplanned schedule interview, coding of the preplanned schedule, second-by-second Global Positioning System tracking, internet-based prompted recall diary, detection of rescheduling decisions (via comparison of planned versus executed activities), and a final in-depth interview probing the how and why of rescheduling decisions. Each stage of the methodology is described in detail with example results drawn from a pilot study. Key discoveries include: elicitation of multiple preplanned schedule reporting methods (verbal, point-form, calendar); discovery that activity attributes (time, location, involved persons) are planned on significantly different time horizons and include partial elaboration; and provision of new insights into how and why rescheduling decisions are made. A method for automatically tracking rescheduling decisions was also discovered. Overall, the new methodology has potential to contribute to the development of more realistic models of the entire scheduling process, especially rescheduling and conflict resolution sub-models.
Sociology	As an aspect of medieval sodomy, masturbation is often ignored or dismissed by medievalists. Although its status within medieval discourse on sex and gender is multiple and contested, this article demonstrates that it does have a recurrent cluster of associations, and it offers an important perspective on medieval masculinities and male sexuality. Moreover, far from constituting a meaningless, solitary act in medieval literature, on the contrary, masturbation is both overdetermined and always already relational.
Nursing	Purpose: To evaluate whether diagnostic blood loss can lead to anemia and consequent blood transfusion among postoperative patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Design and Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in a university-affiliated tertiary hospital between January and August 2016. CHD patients aged <12 years, undergoing cardiac surgery, with a PICU stay >48 hwere included (n=205). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the effect of diagnostic blood loss on anemia and transfusion. Results: The mean daily phlebotomy volume was 5.40 +/- 1.94 mL/d during the PICU stay (adjusted for body weight, 0.63 +/- 0.36 mL/kg/d). Daily volume/kg was associated with cyanotic CHD, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2 score. In total, 101 (49.3%) patients presented with new or more severe anemia after admission to PICU, which was not associated with phlebotomy volume. Forty-one (20.0%) children received one or more RBC transfusions during their PICU stay. Multivariate analysis indicated that PELOD-2 score >5, new or more severe anemia, and daily volume/kg of phlebotomy >0.63 mL/kg/d were significantly associated with transfusion after 48 h of admission to PICU. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that diagnostic blood loss is not related to postoperative anemia in children with CHD; however, this factor does correlate with blood transfusion, since it somewhat reflects the severity of illness. Practice Implications: Strategies should be applied to reduce diagnostic blood loss, as appropriate. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Law	This article analyses the general characteristics and practical cooperation mechanisms of the European Competition Network (ECN) as well as the initial experiences of policy enforcement through this network in the light of and in response to the European Commission Report on the Functioning of Regulation 1/2003. In general, this analysis is positive regarding the initial experiences of ECN. The article, however, finds significant accountability and due process problems caused in particular by the opacity of network management. Primarily, the article argues that, as an unintended consequence of Modernisation, EU competition policy has become vulnerable to the general systemic problems of multi-level governance.
Public Administration	Designing and implementing performance measurement systems in public contracts is not easy. Little evidence is available on what measures work better in producing managerial benefits. This study evaluates the effect of different performance measurement practices on accountability effectiveness in government contracts. The findings suggest that performance measurement has a positive impact on government's ability to effectively manage contracts. More specifically, measuring costs, client impact, service timeliness, and disruptions, as well as specifying detailed processes for service delivery, are associated with higher perceived accountability effectiveness. At the same time, evaluating quality and client satisfaction, and using informal monitoring techniques have a negative impact on accountability effectiveness. The results of this study provide motivation for contract managers to optimize performance monitoring and reduce transaction costs by relying on measures that are more likely to improve contract implementation.
History Of Social Sciences	The 10th Academic Committee of Planning History & Theory (ACPHT) Conference took place on 26-29 October 2018, in the Guilin University of Technology (Guilin, China). The annual conference was held for the first time in 2009. Themed 'Urban Planning in the Course of Civilization', the 2018 conference probed the continuation and evolution of planning history from different civilizations, defined here as cultural characteristic at a particular place and time. More than 200 delegates attended the conference, bringing together researchers from the fields of planning history, architectural history, city design, public administration, cultural heritage protection, archaeology, art and media, municipal aviation, to socialize and share their work with each other, and to gain insight into interdisciplinary historical research methods. Based on a selection of relevant panels and roundtables, the report explores four prominent themes discussed in the conference: planning history in different historical periods, urban form and heritage, the practical role of planning history, and interdisciplinary approach. The relationship between civilizations development and planning history is illustrated through four topics. It also summarizes the academic consensus, theoretical significance, problems and difficulties, and future-oriented experience of the conference.
Business	"Unabsorbed slack resources are critical for organizational innovativeness and success but research regarding the relationship between unabsorbed slack and firm outcomes has resulted in mixed findings. We build on upper echelons theory to shed light on the mostly overlooked role of decision makers in slack resource deployment. We investigate how the CEO""s expertise influences slack resource deployment in computer software firms"" exploratory and exploitative activities. Using panel data, our findings show that unabsorbed slack is associated with an increased share of exploration and a decreased share of exploitation in firm""s activities. These relationships are weakened in firms led by CEOs with longer firm tenure or wider functional background breadth. In the case of CEOs with technical education, the negative relationship between slack and exploitation becomes positive, while the link between slack and exploration becomes negative. Additionally, our post-hoc analysis reveals a more precise non-linear account of the main effect relationships."
Women'S Studies	The article argues for the usefulness of the capability approach in understanding agency in situations of social change. It develops the notion of agency as a continuum of capabilities. Agency defined in this way comprises of various stages of resistance, action, reception and adaptation and involves different capabilities intrinsic to individual well-being, including mobility. Agency as a continuum of capabilities accounts for the element of chance inherent in situations where habits and routines cannot guide action in meaningful ways. It also grasps the new forms of action needed in situations of social change better than definitions of agency that emphasise deliberation and reflexivity. The article illustrates this re-conceptualisation of agency through a close-reading and follow-up of the lives of three Ukrainian women who recall post-Soviet 'transition', migration to Italy and their trajectories into, and out of, domestic work.

Political Science	"This article challenges a common understanding of the role that political disruption plays in promoting large-scale change. It argues that the most basic political work disruption performs is not to win public sympathy but instead to interrupt privileged people""s motivated ignorance. Drawing on examples from the Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter Movements, it makes the case that successful political disruption involves three steps. First, a group of political actors coordinate to withdraw cooperation from an epistemic power relationship, which enables motivated ignorance. Second, this act of epistemic disruption brings latent conflicts to the surface and forces members of dominant groups to take sides. Third, the resulting change in the political agenda enables subordinated actors to negotiate with the politically powerful. The article explains why disruption can be politically effective, even when it fails to win widespread public sympathy."
Environmental Studies	The environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been a tool for decision makers since the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Since that time, few analyses have been performed to verify the quality of information and content within EIAs. High qualify information within assessments is vital in order for decision makers, stake holders, and the public to understand the potential impact of proposed actions on the ecosystem and wildlife species. Low quality information has been a major cause for litigation and economic loss. Since 1999, wind energy development has seen an exponential growth with unknown levels of impact on wildlife species, in particular bird and bat species. The purpose of this article is to: (1) develop, validate, and apply a quantitative index to review avian/bat assessment quality for wind energy EIAs; and (2) assess the trends and status of avian/bat assessment quality in a sample of wind energy EIAs. This research presents the development and testing of the Avian and Bat Assessment Quality Index (ABAQI), a new approach to quantify information quality of ecological assessments within wind energy development EIAs in relation to avian and bat species based on review areas and factors derived from 23 state wind/wildlife siting guidance documents. The ABAQI was tested through a review of 49 publicly available EIA documents and validated by identifying high variation in avian and bat assessments quality for wind energy developments. Of all the reviewed EIAs. 66% failed to provide high levels of preconstruction avian and bat survey information, compared to recommended factors from state guidelines. This suggests the need for greater consistency from recommended guidelines by state, and mandatory compliance by EIA preparers to avoid possible habitat and species loss, wind energy development shut down, and future lawsuits.

Family Studies	This study investigated married women's feelings of balance between their occupational and family roles. Data from 274 married and full-time employed women were collected and structural equation modeling techniques were used to assess the connection between their work and leisure lives, work-family conflict and work-family facilitation, and role balance. Women's satisfaction with their experiences at work and at home, the time they spent in each sphere, and the social support they received from others in each domain were considered. Women's satisfaction with their workplace and family experiences, most notably, spousal support, were positively related to feelings of role balance. The results of this study suggested that satisfaction with experience in one sphere is stronger and more important than the hours spent doing activities in that sphere when accounting for married women's role balance.
International Relations	In this article, I explore a specific relation between mathematics and security calculations. Recalling the confrontations between the mathematician Alan Turing and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in the 1930s, I am interested in the relationship between intuition and ingenuity. During Wittgenstein's 1930 lectures on the foundations of mathematics, Turing interjects in order to insist upon the capacity of number: one can make predictions'. Wittgenstein replies that mathematics makes no predictions', but instead is a form of grammar: taken by itself we shouldn't know what to do with it; it's useless. But there is all kind of use for it as part of a calculus'. It is just such a formulation of a calculus or grammar - decision trees', event trees', attribute-based algorithms' - that characterizes contemporary security. As for Turing, the logic comprises two faculties, which we may call intuition and ingenuity'. The intuitive realm of imagination and speculation reaches toward a possible solution, while the ingenuity seeks arrangements of propositions. The advent of rules-based' and risk-based' security decisions, then, are always already political because they precisely involve combinatorial possibilities whose arrangement has effects in the world.
Ethnic Studies	Historians and social scientists generally understand nationalism to be the defining feature of fascism. Kunkeler's study challenges that assumption with his examination of Swedish fascist movements through the notion of self-identification. Using fascist periodicals, he traces the development of Swedish fascists' identification with the movementin relation to matters of race, nation and the signifiers of fascism' and National Socialism'from the early 1920s, when an overt attachment to Mussolini's project was evident, through a National Socialist phase showing cautious commitment to Nazi Germany, and ending with a final phase of strategic anonymity. In the face of criticism that fascism was an alien import, Swedish fascists adapted their public profile to accommodate such national sensitivities, developing a racialist ideology that was not confined by national borders and was believed to be more in tune with Swedish political culture at the time. When public opinion turned decisively against international fascism' in the mid-1930s, they were forced to discard the name and image of fascism' altogether and enter a final phase of public anonymity that, in any case, involved no significant ideological metamorphosis.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The nuclear age had a profound impact on politics and international affairs. More fundamentally, it altered the way people saw the planet and their relationship with it. These attitudes changed gradually in the post-war period, with the 1960s a key transitional moment. This article explores these changing attitudes towards the environment within the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). At the beginning of the 1960s CND's concerns about nuclear testing and fallout fit easily into the dominant anthropocentric view of the environment. However, by the end of the decade they espoused a much more holistic, even ecocentric, attitude. This article examines how attitudes towards the environment were changing in the 1960s through a close examination of attitudes within CND, and argues that the modern environmental movement was a product of the nuclear age.
Environmental Studies	Supply of some critical raw materials by European industry is becoming more and more difficult. After the case of natural textile fibres, in particular cotton, and timber, over the last few years the problem of rare earths (REs) availability has also risen. The 97% of the global supply of rare earth metals (REMs) is produced by China, that has recently done copious cuts of its exports, apparently in order to protect its environment. This fact has greatly increased the REs prices, causing tension and uncertainty among the world hi-tech markets. Many of these materials, in fact, have very few effective substitutes and low recycling rates too. In addition, their natural reserves of rare earths are concentrated in a small number of countries (China, Brazil, US, Russia, Democratic Republic of Congo). REMs are a group of 17 elements particularly used in many new electronic and advanced components: such as fuel cells, mobile phones, displays, hi-capacity batteries, permanent magnets for wind power generation, green energy devices, etc. Many analysts foresee much more requests in the next decades.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Although the concept of experiential expertise is relatively new in modern health care services, policy, and research, it has profound implications for improving participation in healthcare. The absence of theoretical and conceptual clarity has led to poor understanding and miscommunication among researchers, health practitioners, and policy makers. The aim of this article is to present a concept analysis of experiential expertise and to explain its defining characteristics, applicability, and significance. A combination of Rodger's evolutionary method combined with Schwartz-Barcott and Kim's hybrid model was selected as a method for the analysis of the experiential expertise concept. This method combines theoretical (24 definitions) with empirical data analysis (17 interviews). Antecedents, attributes, and consequences are determined. A comprehensive definition is provided, and the interrelatedness between experiential expertise and related concepts was mapped. Experiential expertise is a complex process exceeding the boundaries of individual experiences. Its availability cannot be taken for granted. Using experiential expertise in health care can facilitate patient empowerment leading to improved quality of life and health care. The present study offers clarity by proposing a conceptual model that can assist researchers, policy makers, and health care professionals in facilitating implementations in practice.
Cultural Studies	This article examines the idea of middle-class monarchy' emerging in Europe from the internationally publicised marriages of Kate Middleton to Prince William in the United Kingdom and Charlene Wittstock to Prince Albert in Monaco. Through a careful analysis of sexuality, class and race in three major British newspapers, we demonstrate how media discourses surrounding the marriages deploy European monarchies as sites of neoliberal governmentality. Deployed as transmitters of instrumental happiness and conceptualised as an individual choice and project achievable through the control of the body and realisation of one's desires, Kate embodies the white postfeminist vision of a highly educated, post-liberation woman able to combine the roles of consumer, homemaker and dutiful wife. This contrasts to the foreign Charlene, whose apparent domestication in an old-fashioned marriage of convenience was pitied widely. Finally, the article examines the Closer topless photo scandal as an incident that both challenged and re-sedimented the sexed, raced and classed neoliberal obligations of individual happiness and self-control.
Gerontology	ObjectivesTo determine whether immune phenotypes associated with immunosenescence are predictive of frailty and mortality within 1-year in elderly nursing home residents. DesignCross sectional study of frailty; prospective cohort study of mortality. SettingThirty-two nursing homes in four Canadian cities between September 2009 and October 2011. ParticipantsNursing home residents aged 65 and older (N = 1,072, median age 86, 72% female). MeasurementsAfter enrollment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained and analyzed using flow cytometry for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets (naive, memory (central, effector, terminally differentiated, senescent), and regulatory T-cells) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-reactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Multilevel linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between immune phenotypes and frailty; frailty was measured at the time of enrollment using the Frailty Index. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the relationship between immune phenotypes and time to death (within 1 year). ResultsMean Frailty Index was 0.44 0.13. Multilevel regression analysis showed that higher percentages of naive CD4(+) T-cells (P = .001) and effector memory CD8(+) T-cells (P = .02) were associated with a lower mean Frailty Index, whereas a higher percentage of CD8(+) central memory T-cells was associated with a higher mean Frailty Index score (P = .02). One hundred fifty one (14%) members of the cohort died within 1 year. Multivariable analysis showed a significant negative multiplicative interaction between age and percentage of CMV-reactive CD4(+) T-cells (hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.96). No other significant factors were identified. ConclusionImmune phenotypes found to be predictive of frailty and mortality in this study can help further understanding of immunosenescence and may provide a rationale for future intervention studies designed to modulate immunity.
Criminology & Penology	Patron banning in Australia embodies a range of exclusionary measures in response to alcohol-related disorder. Patrons can be banned from licensed venues, entertainment precincts or wider public areas. Banning mechanisms remove and exclude troublesome individuals and are presumed to deter them, and others, from engaging in further problematic behaviour. The use of exclusion reflects key assumptions in relation to alcohol-related disorderly behaviour and effective management of risks to which it may give rise. However, the rationale underpinning much of the banning-related legislative and operational policing developments reflects largely unsubstantiated assertions of need and effect. Despite the steady expansion of banning powers across Australian jurisdictions there is limited oversight of their use. This article examines the expansion of police-imposed banning powers. Their discretionary, on-the-spot and permissible pre-emptive imposition has potential consequences that extend beyond the management of alcohol-related issues. Yet their use and effect has been subject to little scrutiny.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The 4-H youth development organization is a complex public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the nation's Cooperative Extension system and National 4-H Council, a private, nonprofit partner. The current article is focused on a partnership approach to the evaluation of a national 4-H Science initiative that engaged both internal and external evaluators as well as key stakeholders. While external evaluators are valued for their relative lack of bias and independence, internal evaluation has been the predominant strategy used by the Cooperative Extension system. For this evaluation, we adopted a hybrid approach that teamed an external evaluation firm with a team of internal evaluators and key stakeholders. We discuss specific strategies and approaches that we developed to implement this approach in the 4-H youth development organization and offer suggestions for how it might be useful in other complex, multipartner organizations.
Criminology & Penology	Restorative justice has been the subject of much theoretical criminological debate and policy innovation. However, little consideration has been given explicitly to issues of temporality and the challenges they raise. Yet, at its heart, restorative justice provides a rearticulated understanding of the relationship between the past and future; one that seeks to marry otherwise tense and ambiguous dynamics of instrumental and moral reasoning, along with risk-based and punitive logics. This article explores a number of dimensions in which questions of time, timing and time-consciousness are implicated in conceptions and practices of restorative justice. It highlights the social, plural and contested nature of time and temporalizations with relevance to restorative justice. It points to new lines of enquiry and analysis with inferences for the implementation of restorative values and conceptions of justice. It concludes with reflections on the multiple temporalities inferred in shifts of scale in the application of restorative justice.
Nursing	New media simulation stories are short multimedia presentations that combine simulation, digital technology, and story branching to depict a variety of healthcare-related scenarios. The purpose of this study was to explore whether learning outcomes were enhanced if students viewed the results of both correct and incorrect nursing actions demonstrated through new media simulation stories. A convenience sample of 109 undergraduate nursing students in a family-centered maternity course participated in the study. Study findings suggests that students who viewed both correct and incorrect depictions of maternity nursing actions scored better on tests than did those students who viewed only correct nursing actions.
Ethnic Studies	"Using a historical institutionalist framework emphasizing the importance of transformative events, this paper seeks to explain the sudden emergence of self-determination claims in Hong Kong and their transformation into separatist ones in Catalonia. The paper argues that the inflexibility of the state in addressing moderate demands for regional autonomy has played a major role in the emergence and radicalization of these demands. In Hong Kong, the 1997 Handover from British to Chinese sovereignty was originally presented as an opportunity for self-governance under the principle of ""Hong Kong People ruling Hong Kong"" and the ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula. If Hong Kong nationalism was practically unheard of in the early years of the Handover, the unconciliatory attitude of the central government towards moderate demands for the actualization of the autonomy and democratization frameworks vested in Hong Kong's Basic Law has directly contributed to the formation of today's emerging self-determination movement. In Catalonia, the 2010 decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court to annul some articles of the reform to the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia and to interpret others narrowly represented a transformative event that took Catalonia onto the pathway of secessionist politics. The secessionist turn was then further fed by the on-going refusal of the central government to negotiate with the Catalan government, notably on the notion of a popular consultation on the political future of the Autonomous Community."
Nursing	This study investigates factors affecting the fit between nursing tasks and mobile nursing information systems and the relationships between the task-technology fit of mobile nursing information systems and nurse performance from the perspective of task-technology fit. Survey research recruited nursing staffs as subjects from selected case hospital. A total of 310 questionnaires were sent out, and 219 copies were obtained, indicating a valid response rate of 70.6%. Collected data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique. Our study found that dependence tasks have positive effects on information acquisition (gamma = 0.234, P < .05) and information identification (gamma = 0.478, P < .001), and independent tasks have significant effects on information acquisition (gamma = 0.213, P < .05). Therefore, the introduction of mobile nursing information systems in assisting nursing practices can help facilitate both independent and dependent nursing tasks. Our study discovered that the supporting functions of mobile nursing information systems have positive effects on information integration and interpretation (gamma = 0.365, P < .001), as well as information acquisition (gamma = 0.253, P < .05). The service supports of mobile nursing information systems have positive effects on information acquisition (gamma = 0.318, P < .001) and information integration and interpretation (gamma = 0.143, P < .01). Furthermore, information identification (beta = .055, P < .05), information acquisition (beta = .176, P < .001), and information integration and interpretation (beta = .706, P < .001) provided using mobile nursing information systems have positive effects on nursing performance, indicating 83.2% of totally explained variance. As shown, the use of mobile nursing information systems could provide nursing staffs with real-time and accurate information to increase efficiency and effectiveness in patient-care duties, further improving nursing performance.
History	This paper addresses the evolving profile of the class of scribes or munshis who emerged during the phase of consolidation of Mughal rule in northern India, as Mughal power waned in the course of the eighteenth century. It argues that while the social and political base of this class was expanded by opportunities provided by the empire, these munshis in turn sought to develop their own understanding of events both past and present. In the late seventeenth century they began to generate their own templates of history writing together with other forms of belles-lettres. In the first half of the eighteenth century, their power seemed to be on the increase as many made the transition to becoming significant political actors themselves. However, they were unable to consolidate their position in the latter decades of the century, when they emerged instead as critics of the new forms that Mughal power was taking. The essay is based on a reading of texts produced by a number of these authors, largely in Persian.
History	This article explores the ways in which Europeans encountered indigenous knowledge in Asia and the Americas during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and reconstructs the social factors that enabled productive cross-cultural knowledge encounters within a particular temporal and cultural context. By focusing on the tacit nature of medical knowledge and on the structure of the networks that enabled cross-cultural brokerage I develop a framework that explains why knowledge exchange occurred in some situations and not in others. In particular, I argue that a unique marriage institution that emerged in the Dutch-controlled regions of the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the seventeenth-century fostered European access to indigenous botanical knowledge by reshaping the patterns of relationships that linked European, mestiza, and indigenous cultures. Women in Southeast Asia were the important medical practitioners within their local communities. By fostering and formalizing relationships with Asian and mestiza women this marriage institution both created direct ties with local experts while also integrating European men in to a community who relied primarily on local botanical cures for their medical care and who could broker relationships with local practitioners.
Rehabilitation	Introduction: This study presents and evaluates the use of a method using local cues to indicate perspective in tactile diagrams as compared to the current use of visual perspective methods. Methods: Perspective for an object using local cues is represented with standard visual perspective lines but with the thickness of the lines varying as a function of depth away from the viewer. Performance of visually impaired study participants (that is, those who are blind or have low vision), using the new method and the standard visual perspective method, were compared as functions of: onset of vision loss of a participant, perspective method used, repetition, and object and perspective of an object presented. Results: For the main task, the method used-Wald chi(2) (1, 585) = 7.147, p = 0.008-and the method-repetition interaction-Wald chi(2) (1, 585) = 4.272, p = 0.039-had significant effects. Participants performed better with our new method and there was a significant improvement for (only) this method between repetitions. Discussion: The findings demonstrate that our new method improved the performance of users for tasks involving perspective on diagrams over the standard visual perspective method. The data also indicates that with more repetition, improvement could become even greater than observed during this study. Implications for practitioners: Perspective frequently plays a critical role in aiding the understanding of questions in mathematics and science. Adding local cues to a standard perspective diagram shows promise in improving users' ability to interpret objects.
Environmental Studies	Artificial reefs are one of a number of tools that should be considered by scientists and managers when planning coastal zone restoration and/or mitigation projects. In this article, the details of one project from the West Florida Shelf are presented. Two types of artificial reefs were used to mitigate pipeline construction impacts on natural hardbottom ledges in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The project's primary objective was to avoid the paradigm of building artificial reefs as fish attraction devices, and to instead implement a design that would mimic, not augment, natural hardbottom conditions. Fish assemblage parameters (species richness and commercial fish abundances) were compared between the artificial habitats and natural hardbottom reference sites. Results indicate that species richness trends are similar among artificial and natural reefs, while certain commercial fish abundances are significantly higher on the artificial reefs. Recommendations for future restoration/mitigation projects using artificial reefs are discussed.
Ethics	The article ventures a reading of Russian postcommunist politics from the perspective of the messianic turn in continental political philosophy, specifically Giorgio Agamben's conception of the 'end of history'. Taking its point of departure from a retrospective construction in the Russian political discourse of the 1990s as a period of 'timelessness', the paper argues that postcommunism may indeed be viewed as a paradoxical 'time out of time', a rupture in the ordinary temporality that entirely dispenses with the teleological horizon of politics. While the problematic of the 'end of history' has been popularized by Francis Fukuyama's liberal recasting of Kojeve's reading of Hegel, the Russian experience is entirely contrary to this complacent and self-gratifying account of the triumph of liberalism and accords, instead, with Agamben's understanding of the end of history as the deactivation of the teleological dimension of politics as such. The effect of this deactivation is not a catastrophic disintegration of the social order but rather the opening of the possibility of an inoperative political praxis that is oriented towards the affirmation of existence in the pure present. The article proceeds with outlining the implications of this reading of Russian postcommunism for understanding the present conjuncture of Russian politics.
Anthropology	"The upper ankle joint forms a single articular plane between organism and the foot and substrate. Singular warp analysis shows that its shape reflects substrate use. This study explores whether the differences in shape are genetic with a developmental trajectory evident during ontogeny or epigenetic and the result of substrate use by the individual. A total of 418 matched distal tibial and proximal talar landmarked surfaces from adult and subadult specimens from 12 diverse catarrhine taxa were studied. Specimens were grouped by molar eruption (M1, M2, and M3) for comparative analysis. Generalized Procrustes analysis, multivariate regression, relative warp analysis, singular warp analysis, and permutation tests were used. Singular warp analysis for the entire cohort was highly significant in the first singular warp, with the adult taxa sorting by substrate use. All 173 subadults clustered with an adult ""arboreal"" shape profile. Among Hominoidea, adults (M3) sorted by substrate use with Pan paniscus and Hylobatidae assuming an ""arboreal"" shape separate from Pan troglodytes and the remaining taxa with ""terrestrial"" shape. Cercopithecoid adults sorted by substrate use as well, with the M3 specimens of Papio hamadryas and Macaca thibetana demonstrating a ""terrestrial"" shape. Differences in mode of locomotion did not affect the findings in the first singular warp. Results confirmed the convergence of talo-crural shape among superfamilies based on substrate use and divergence in shape within Pan and Macaca, based on substrate use. The shape differences among adults (M3) are consistent with a plastic response to the behavioral stimulus of substrate use. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Business, Finance	We find that China's P/E ratio is comparable to that of the U.S. S&P 1500 index, a broad based index covering large, middle, and small capitalization firms. We provide an explanation as to why China's seemingly low P/E ratio is not surprising in light of the economic growth that it has experienced. Specifically, we show that (i) the P/E ratio is negatively associated with earnings volatility in both the Chinese and U.S. stock markets with an economically significant magnitude; and (ii) historical earnings volatility is considerably higher in China than in the U.S. Higher earnings volatility in China offsets higher growth prospect in setting the P/E ratio, making its PIE ratio much closer to what is observed empirically than otherwise implied by its growth rate.

Business, Finance	In this paper, I discuss how a situated cognition perspective can reveal the socially constructed nature of seemingly psychological heuristics and errors in market actors' judgements and decisions in financial markets. In doing so, I present a complementary approach to the heuristics and biases research in psychology and behavioural finance. More specifically, I draw on the narrative mode of knowing and explanation in real market settings as a framework to understand the content and the process of socially constructed knowledge in financial markets. Here, narratives of market actors and their underlying frames and causal schemas are assumed to function as a judgement heuristic in processing information flows. I then discuss an application of this approach to a sample of brokerage firms and investment advisers serving retail investors in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). My findings focus on a shared frame and the associated causal schema about the ISE and global financial markets. This observed interpretive model underpinned my interlocutors' narrative judgements and forecasts about the ISE's movements and constituted a form of representativeness heuristic and anchoring.
Communication	"Going beyond broad descriptions of kanji as ""adult"" or hiragana as ""childish"", this study investigates how variant applications of these two Japanese scripts can play a role in indexing identity within written dialogue. Looking at differing standards for kanji and hiragana use throughout the dialogue in three Japanese manga (comics), the study examines the contexts where kanji-absent, kanji-light, and locally unmarked orthographic styles are used, modified, or abandoned in each text to identify the specific contexts that motivate each local orthographic style. For two of the manga, supplementary data is provided by an inter-view with the author. The findings show that while all three authors use kanji and hiragana in ways that reflect the scripts' respective links to adults and children, the conventions serve to index features the author treats as defining of particular identities rather than character age. Furthermore, comparison of the orthographic practices across the three manga shows each author putting their own mark on broadly recognized orthographic styles, and in doing so participating in the maintenance, circulation, and development of language ideologies rather than just images of each script.

Ethics	The requirement that moral theories be usable for making decisions runs afoul of the fact that decision makers often lack sufficient information about their options to derive any accurate prescriptions from the standard theories. Many theorists attempt to solve this problem by adopting subjective moral theories-ones that ground obligations on the agent's beliefs about the features of her options, rather than on the options' actual features. I argue that subjective deontological theories (such as Prichard's and Ross's) suffer a fatal flaw, since they cannot appropriately require agents to gather information before acting.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	We derive lower and upper bounds for theValue-at-Risk of a portfolio of losseswhen the marginal distributions are known and independence among (some) subgroups of the marginal components is assumed. We provide several actuarial examples showing that the newly proposed bounds strongly improve those available in the literature that are based on the sole knowledge of the marginal distributions. When the variance of the joint portfolio loss is small enough, further improvements can be obtained.
Demography	BACKGROUND Data on migration trends are crucially lacking in developing countries. The lack of basic information on migration contrasts sharply with the increasing importance of migration in the policy agenda of both sending and receiving countries. OBJECTIVE The general objectives of this paper are: to show how trends in international migration can be reconstructed with three questions in a household survey; to evaluate the precision of the estimates; and to test how sensitive the estimates are to several methodological choices and assumptions. METHODS Migration trends are reconstructed with event history models. The reconstruction uses data collected through migration surveys conducted in cities in three countries (Senegal, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ghana) as part of the MAFE (Migration between Africa and Europe) project. Specifically, two types of data are used: simple data on the first migration of children of household heads, collected through household surveys, and full migration histories of children collected in biographic surveys. First, we evaluate the precision of our estimates using data collected in the household questionnaire. Next, the sensitivity of our results to different methodological choices and assumptions is evaluated. RESULTS Estimates using household data may be affected by large confidence intervals, and migrations trends are influenced by the simplifying assumptions that are made when using these data. Despite these limitations, estimates based on three simple questions provide useful information on migration levels and trends.
Demography	"Schematically one can distinguish two traditions related to ethnic statistics in Europe. In France, Germany and most southern European countries, the dominant statistical categorisations merely distinguish individuals on the basis of their nationality. In contrast, most northern European countries have been producing data on the ethnic and/or foreign origin of their populations. Belgium is caught somewhere in between these two traditions. The French speaking part of Belgium tends to follow the French tradition of refusing ethnic categorisation, while the Flemish try to copy the Dutch model in distinguishing ""allochthones"" and ""autochthones."" This contribution offers an analysis of the construction of ethnic categories as it has been undertaken in the Dutch context and (partially) imported in Belgium."
Social Issues	A commonly explored theme in international civil society organisation (CSO) collaborations is the dominance of Northern CSOs and how this impinges on Southern CSOs' autonomy, but there is little work on the relative importance of different collaborations for Southern CSOs. This study examined complementarity as a new approach to understanding CSO collaboration. Seeking Southern perspectives, we examined the case of CSOs working on disaster risk reduction in India and developed a typology of complementarities in this domain. The article considers the implications for understanding complementarity in broader CSO collaborations. We find that constructing collaborations through the lens of complementarity may facilitate capitalising on diversity among CSOs and help build collaborations that consider the domestic orientation of many Southern CSOs and reshape the roles of Northern CSOs as complementary rather than leading.
Public Administration	Individual performance evaluations provide the link between individual and organizational performance. Employees expect to be rated based on their success in meeting their individual performance objectives regardless of their grade or position in the agency or other nonperformance-related criteria. This study examines performance appraisal ratings from three federal agencies (U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency) to learn whether the evaluation processes are free of a systemic bias based on an individual's position in the hierarchy. The analysis suggests that such a bias does exist and that this bias presents challenges to those who design, implement, and use performance evaluations to support their performance management systems and overall organizational performance. The importance of these exploratory findings goes to the question of fairness and equity in performance management systems, both real and perceived, and the impact of such beliefs on employee satisfaction and performance.
History Of Social Sciences	Javier de Mesones-Cabello was an influential and active planner of the 1960s and 1970s in Spain, who passed away in December, 2016. His professional career as a self-taught urban planner was extensively linked to his academic and institutional activities. These connections supported the establishment of relationships with prestigious professionals working in urban planning practice. In planning the 1969 masterplan for the city of Valladolid, in Spain, de Mesones-Cabello made several intellectual references to the Greek urban planner Doxiadis. This masterplan covers a relatively unknown example of directional city growth in a European context. My findings elucidate the extent to which de Mesones-Cabello was influenced by Doxiadis, and the circumstances in which these ideas have continued to dominate thinking about Valladolid's urban development.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	"The literature on service quality and customer loyalty has long focused on enhancing the work of service providers. This study examined ""the other side of the coin"" in service co-production or value co-creation in service encounters by investigating how service providers might take a proactive approach to building relationships based on mandatory customer participation (MCP). The research evaluated how such antecedents as role clarity, self-efficacy, purchase importance, and servicescape could influence MCP. Path analysis revealed that these four factors significantly influenced different dimensions of MCP; which in turn had a significant impact on customer loyalty. Using these insights, managers could develop a strategic approach to managing customer roles in the service delivery process. This study adds to the body of knowledge on service quality by demonstrating empirically the determinants and structure of MCP and their relationships with customer loyalty in service co-production processes in a hospitality setting.

Health Policy & Services	The World Health Organization recommends that before lymphatic filariasis elimination in an area can be confirmed, an additional survey should be performed at least 5 years after stopping mass drug administration. The current study aimed to determine the status of lymphatic filariasis 5 years after cessation of the mass drug administration in 3 sentinel Egyptian villages in Menoufiya Governorate. The rapid immunochromatographic card test (ICT) and a new commercial antibody detection kit (CELISA (R)) were used. All 1321 primary-school children aged 6-7 years old were ICT negative but 27 children were antibody positive. All households surveyed in one village with the highest antibody prevalence were ICT negative, indicating an absence of lymphatic filariasis. The CELISA antibody kit needs more standardization and development to be useful under field conditions. We conclude that lymphatic filariasis is no longer a public health problem in these villages and other villages with similar epidemiological conditions.
Rehabilitation	"This article describes the recent revision of the Code of Professional Ethics for Rehabilitation Counselors, specifically addressing the Roles and Relationships With Clients ethical standard. A brief historical overview is provided of the terminology and the debate surrounding the outdated dual-relationship ethical rule in rehabilitation counseling. The term exploitation is also delimited. The revised ethical standards are addressed, with attention given to the standard allowing for ""potentially beneficial"" interactions. Implications for rehabilitation counseling practice are outlined."
Education & Educational Research	Problem: As NYU medical students, the authors determined that there was no structured form of service learning in their curriculum. They sought to establish a service program that recognizes students for their dedication to community service in both the NYU and NYC communities. Approach: In 2012, with the support of the Office of Student Affairs (OSA), the authors created the NYU School of Medicine Community Service Program (CSP). The program tracks and verifies students' participation in service projects. It sets a goal for students to complete 100 service hours through at least five unique service initiatives. Two reflective essays at the completion of pre-clinical and core clerkship curricula challenge students to express how their service experiences will inform their future careers in medicine. The authors developed an innovative online portal for students to track their service involvement and allow the committee to easily approve hours. They created the Community Service Committee, made up of two representatives from each class year, to be in charge of regulating the program together with the OSA. Outcomes: The class of 2015 is the first class to participate; thus far, 13 students have met program requirements. In the classes of 2016 and 2017, 20 and 41 students, respectively, are expected to receive the award. Total participation has significantly increased in successive class years. Next steps: The authors seek to gather data on CSP participants' changing perspectives and hope the program can serve as a model for other schools to build service learning into their curricula.
Law	The protection of plants through the patent system and through a sui generis system of plant variety protection causes numerous difficulties and tensions when the protection granted overlaps and intersects. This article explores the particular difficulties that arise in relation to plant research. It considers and contrasts the scope of the research exception as it applies to intellectual property rights (IPR) and the difficulties caused by the divergences in scope.
Cultural Studies	Focusing on the speculative methodologies used to generate models of the financial and meteorological future, this article develops a series of theses on the 'evental' and 'atmospheric' quality of contemporary power. What is at stake in the circulation of capital today, I argue, is not so much the exchange of equivalents as the universal transmutability of fluctutation. Whether we are dealing with the turbulence of world financial markets or that of complex earth systems, the non-dialectical relation can itself be extracted, recombined and liquefied, as it were, in a dimension of its own. In the same way that financial derivatives price the variable relation between and across national currencies, weather derivatives now make it possible to issue contracts on the unknowable contingencies embedded in complex atmospheric relations. This reconfiguration of value requires a thorough rethinking of classical sociological conceptions of debt, promise and political violence.
Law	There is a long-standing debate about the relative merits of lawyers and nonlawyers as adjudicators in international dispute settlement. Some argue that lawyers encourage predictability and coherence in jurisprudence. Others believe that nonlawyers better protect state interests. Both sides of the debate assume that lawyers are more formalist and nonlawyers more instrumentalist. However, this assumption has never been empirically verified. Combining multiple-imputation, matching, and postmatching regression analysis, we find that panel chairs without law degrees and substantial experience make greater efforts than lawyers to signal adherence to formalist rules and competence in the World Trade Organization's jurisprudence. The Appellate Body deems the signal credible, in turn rewarding inexperienced nonlawyers with a decrease in reversal rates. Our findings suggest that nonlawyers display levels of formalism that are similar to (if not greater than) those of lawyers, which calls into question one of the classical reservations against nonlawyers serving in adjudicatory positions.
Ethnic Studies	This paper uses the 2010 Ethnic Minority British Election Study to look at the political attitudes of Muslims in Britain. It tests the relationship between political alienation and political participation on the one hand, and Islamophobia and disapproval of British military involvement in Afghanistan on the other. The principal findings are that perceptions of Islamophobia are linked to greater political alienation, to a greater likelihood of non-electoral participation and to a lower likelihood of voting among Muslims. Likewise, disapproval of the war in Afghanistan is associated with greater political alienation and a greater likelihood of some types of non-electoral participation. There is strong evidence that British Muslims are more likely to interpret discrimination they experience as motivated by their religion and that they perceive more prejudice at the group level. These findings have two theoretical implications. First, they support the theory that non-electoral participation is motivated by dissatisfaction with the party political system. Second, they suggest that perceptions of sociotropic discrimination (for minorities) and a rare salient political issue in which all parties are in opposition to most voters can lead to negative affect towards the political system and stimulate non-electoral participation at the expense of voting.
Linguistics	The present article seeks to fill a gap in the history of English-language teaching in Spain by delving into a key nineteenth-century Catalan institution called the Board of Commerce, forerunner of the current Chamber of Commerce of Barcelona, with specific attention to the origins and early development of the Board of Commerce School of Languages. The microhistory of the School of English (1826-1851) forms the central focus of this study, which constitutes a particular' history of language teaching of the sort recommended by Stern (1983: 83). Topics including typology of students and textbooks used in class are considered, as is the methodology followed by the only teacher of English throughout the 25 years of the School's existence, William Casey (1795-1857). To achieve that, all the original documents on the Board of Commerce School of English, held at the Library of Catalonia (Barcelona), were perused bringing to light some key documents such as the School of English monthly reports and Casey's teaching plan. From a relatively macro-historical' perspective, Casey's English-teaching methodology is assessed in relation to the ideas of leading European foreign language innovators of the time such as Hamilton, Ahn, and Ollendorff. In that regard, the results show that Casey's methodology bears a resemblance to the ones put forward by those innovators, thus indicating Casey's eclecticism as far as English-language teaching is concerned.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	English proficiency is associated with alcohol use in some immigrants groups, but little is known about its association among Arab Americans. Ethnographic work suggests gender, religion, education, and age influence prevalence of alcohol use among Arab Americans. Two years prospective study of recent Iraqi refugees and non-Iraqi Arab immigrants in Michigan using bilingual surveys and interviewers. At Time 1, prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 20.5 % with males, Christians, better educated, older, and those with greater proficiency in English more likely to report ever drank. At Time 2, lifetime prevalence of drinking had increased to 34.0 %. In analysis of male new drinkers, risk factors were Christian, older age and greater proficiency in English. This study confirms drinking among recent immigrant Arab Americans varies by subgroups and suggests English proficiency may contribute to the increase in prevalence over time.
Nursing	"Introduction: Direct patient care across the lifespan has been the standard for nursing clinical experiences over the past several years. Recently, the Ohio Board of Nursing ruled that 100% of pediatric clinical hours could be replaced with simulation. Purpose: Make a recommendation for the number of direct patient care clinical hours in pediatrics that are needed to meet the pediatric nursing competencies. Method: All fifty United States Boards of Nursing prelicensure nursing education requirementswere reviewed to identify the number of required clinical hours and definitions for clinical experience. In addition, the Society of Pediatric Nurses members were surveyed to identify the number of direct pediatric clinical hours needed to achieve the Society of Pediatric Nurses pediatric pre-licensure competencies. Results: Only ten states outline any requirements regarding the required number of clinical hours for prelicensure nursing education and twenty-six states incorporate language that defines clinical experiences. Conclusion: All prelicensure students take the standardized National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), therefore, a consensus among the state boards of nursing outlining the minimum number of clinical hours required to reach nursing competency is needed. Practice Implications: Based on the survey results of the Society of Pediatric Nurses""members and expert opinion of the pediatric authors, a minimum of 61 to 80 clinical hours in direct care of pediatric patients is necessary for nursing students tomeet the Society of Pediatric Nurses"" recommended pediatric nursing content, obtain pediatric nursing competency, and be able to care for pediatric patients and their families.

Cultural Studies	"The Snatch Game episodes of RuPaul""s Drag Race are hugely popular and highly anticipated. A test of their make-up and acting skills, the game requires competitors to impersonate celebrities and answer outrageous questions in-character. The hyperbolic nature of these impersonations, consistent with the culture and affective resonance of drag and camp, invites us to read them as performed caricatures. Caricature, like camp, can be critical and transgressive. It can also depend on gendered, classed, ableist or racialised stereotypes as part of its implied critique of its subject. This article will consider how Snatch Game caricatures manifest this play of subversion and conservatism in relation to the selection of celebrity subjects and the modes of performance applied to the impersonation of them. This article will analyse the relationship between drag, caricature and celebrity as it plays out in The Snatch Game, by considering how the celebrity impersonation draws on and subverts a celebrity""s persona. If camp can be defined as ""queer parody"", drag impersonations may be looked at as queer caricature."
Information Science & Library Science	"Background Experts suggest that formulary alerts at the time of medication order entry are the most effective form of clinical decision support to automate formulary management. Objective Our objectives were to quantify the frequency of inappropriate nonformulary medication (NFM) alert overrides in the inpatient setting and provide insight on how the design of formulary alerts could be improved. Methods Alert overrides of the top 11 (n = 206) most-utilized and highest-costing NFMs, from January 1 to December 31, 2012, were randomly selected for appropriateness evaluation. Using an empirically developed appropriateness algorithm, appropriateness of NFM alert overrides was assessed by 2 pharmacists via chart review. Appropriateness agreement of overrides was assessed with a Cohen's kappa. We also assessed which types of NFMs were most likely to be inappropriately overridden, the override reasons that were disproportionately provided in the inappropriate overrides, and the specific reasons the overrides were considered inappropriate. Results Approximately 17.2% (n = 35.4/206) of NFM alerts were inappropriately overridden. Non-oral NFM alerts were more likely to be inappropriately overridden compared to orals. Alerts overridden with ""blank"" reasons were more likely to be inappropriate. The failure to first try a formulary alternative was the most common reason for alerts being overridden inappropriately. Conclusion Approximately 1 in 5 NFM alert overrides are overridden inappropriately. Future research should evaluate the impact of mandating a valid override reason and adding a list of formulary alternatives to each NFM alert; we speculate these NFM alert features may decrease the frequency of inappropriate overrides."
History Of Social Sciences	The invention of victimization surveys is often presented as a synthesis of the two theoretical attitudes that, supposedly, dominated the 1960s debate over official crime statistics: realism and social constructionism. This paper turns this genesis story on its head. Using original archives, I argue that victimization surveys responded to organizational opportunities in the field of applied research. It was only after the fact that two of their architects seized the debate on crime measurement to broadcast their invention. In so doing they strategically recast the terms of this debate into a binary division between two antithetical social ontologies. This case is used to discuss how social scientists come to reinterpret and misunderstand their history.
Communication	"Filmmaker Jonah J. ""Bud"" Greenspan wrote, directed, and produced 43 films about the Olympics over the last four decades. Drawing on public memory literature and hegemony theory, the manuscript offers a textual analysis of Greenspan's official Olympic films and his representation of Olympism. Overall, the study involved the analysis of seven of Greenspan's official Olympic films, along with more than 50 video and print interviews with the American-born documentarian housed at the George Foster Peabody Archives."
History Of Social Sciences	East London's former docklands have been at the centre of planning and regeneration debates for the past four decades. The setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) has been variously interpreted as '3-D Thatcherism' in action, a symbol of the death of comprehensive planning and the replacement of a corporatist, Keynesian era of urban policy with a more neoliberal approach. Moving away from simplistic and straightforward interpretations of the processes happening at this time, this article uses new archival and interview material to re-examine the setting up of the LDDC and its early years, revealing a more complex and contradictory picture than existing accounts suggest. It focuses on three themes: changing forms of state intervention; the uncertain 'break' in the post-war consensus as evidenced by the changes in approaches to the regeneration of Docklands; and the unintended, disordered process of actual policy change. As such we aim to reveal how shifting visions, modes of governance and practices could compete and co-exist in the midst of seemingly coherent 'eras', as Docklands as a place and as an approach to regeneration was constantly made and re-made - a process that continues to this day.
Anthropology	The ability of sedimentary proxies (especially dung fungal spores) to reflect the past presence and density of large herbivores on a landscape has been receiving increasing scrutiny. Here we examine the Sporormiella spore record from a well-dated, multi-proxy, highly organic sedimentary record from the small lake basin of Marcacocha in the Cuzco region of Peru. The basin, a wetland since ca. AD 1840, existed as a small lake for at least 4000 years prior. Previous work at Marcacocha has shown that changes in herbivore densities reflect the abundances of oribatid mites preserved in the lake sediments. This study tests the assumption that both the Sporormiella and the oribatid mite records responded in broadly the same way to changes in herbivore densities over the past 1200 years. Analysis reveals a very low covariance between concentrations of Sporormiella spores and the two major components of the oribatid mite assemblage: a single aquatic species of Hydrozetes and a less abundant, wider grouping comprising members of the mostly terrestrial superfamily Ceratozetoidea (referred to as the 'ceratozetoids'). Variations in the Hydrozetes assemblage clearly dovetail with known historical events, including the massive decline of indigenous and camelid populations following the collapse of the Inca Empire in the mid sixteenth century. Comparison with other environmental proxies from the Marcacocha sequence, including diatoms and charophyte oospores, suggests that the ceratozetoids appear to reflect increasing terrestrialization. In contrast, although the Sporormiella record indicates the presence of livestock, it fails to register the major historical changes in herbivore presence, though reflects well episodes of lake-level lowering. In small lake settings, therefore, the use of Sporormiella to estimate the density of herbivores in the catchment might be considered a relatively blunt instrument when compared with some other indicators.
Sociology	This study examines inmates' core discussion network prior to their incarceration. The core discussion network consists of the immediate social circle of relatively strong ties. The aims of the study are twofold: (1) to describe inmates' core discussion network prior to their incarceration in terms of network structure, relationship quality and embedded socioeconomic resources; (2) to compare inmates' core discussion network with the core discussion network of the general Dutch population. Data are analyzed from the Prison Project (n = 1909) and the Survey of the Social Networks of the Dutch (n = 394). Compared with the general Dutch population, prior to incarceration, prisoners generally have a core discussion network that is similar to or even better with respect to network structure and relationship quality. However, prisoners' core discussion network members seem to lack socioeconomic resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Management	We apply information processing theory to investigate the evolution of regional management. Based on a longitudinal case study of a European multinational we capture the overall structural development of the firm and within this context, we conduct an in-depth analysis of two regions and their regional management centres. We conceptualise regional management as a system of differentiated centres. The notion that headquarters can be found in a single location is replaced by the view that headquarters' activities are spatially distributed within a system. Over time, this multi-level system adapts to changing information processing requirements.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	In the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in knitting and an accompanying set of leisure practices from stitch n bitch' groups and pub knitting circles to fibre festivals and knit meets. Alongside this renaissance is a growing presence of crafsters' and knitsters' on the web, with blogs and podcasts devoted to the craft and social networking sites connecting a global community of knitters. The leisure experience of knitting now proliferates across multiple media sites and flows through various lifeworlds and circuits of consumption. This technological expression of the craft provides an interesting juxtaposition for exploring meanings and practices of mediated leisure and this article will argue that web 2.0 technologies have given users new ways to think about and engage with their creativity that, in turn, have become an embedded part of their construction and enjoyment of leisure practice. Technology use can be understood as a reciprocal and interconnected aspect of knitting as leisure and the study of techno-cultural change marks a territory where distinctions between leisure and technology are increasingly dissolved. Knitting as a material craft provides a useful example of the way in which virtual networks and environments have reshaped the consumption of leisure in rich and dynamic ways. ???????, ?????????, ????????????, ???????????????????????????, ?????????????, ????????????????????????? ????????????????????, ???????????????????????????????????????????????????, Web 2.0?????????????????????, ???, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????-???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Economics	I use a novel loan-level dataset covering lending by official creditors to developing country governments to construct an instrument for government spending. Loans from official creditors typically finance multiyear public spending projects, with disbursements linked to the stages of project implementation. The identification strategy exploits the long lags between approval and eventual disbursement of these loans to isolate a predetermined component of public spending associated with past loan approval decisions taken before the realization of contemporaneous shocks. In a large sample of 102 developing countries over the period 1970-2010, the one-year spending multiplier is reasonably-precisely estimated to be around 0.4.
Business	"Given recent interest in social media, many brands now create content that they hope consumers will view and share with peers. While some campaigns indeed go ""viral,"" their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors' framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality and the mechanisms underlying these effects."
Women'S Studies	"Media coverage often reports ""good"" news about the criminal justice system's ability to effectively respond to sexual assault, concluding that the past two decades have seen an increase in rape reporting, prosecution, and conviction. The objective of this article is to examine the validity of such conclusions by critically reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of various data sources and comparing the statistics they produce. These statistics include estimates for sexual assault reporting rates and case outcomes in the criminal justice system. We conclude that such pronouncements are not currently supported by statistical evidence, and we outline some directions for future research and reform efforts to make the ""good news"" a reality in the United States."
Public Administration	Privatization has increasingly become a policy option for government agencies struggling to meet rising demands for services but with fewer resources. In the transportation arena, many state departments of transportation (DOTs) have privatized by outsourcing highway functions to the private sector. But the outsourcing of technical and expert services such as those related to the design and construction of highway infrastructure may result in a smaller or less knowledgeable DOT workforce that is unable to perform the necessary contract management to ensure the quality of the work done by contractors. We posit an outsourcing process in which DOTs respond to the combination of increased demand for highway services and growing workforce constraints by contracting out much of the work formerly performed by in-house personnel. This, in turn, can produce perceptions of quality problems regarding the outsourced work and a subsequent expansion of the workforce. We examine the extent to which different highway-related tasks are being outsourced, the effect of workforce and employment factors on outsourcing, the perceptions of highway officials regarding the impact of outsourcing on cost-effectiveness and the service quality of the outsourced work, and subsequent employment levels.
Economics	Collective-action problems pervade all societies as well as ecological systems used by humans. Substantial evidence has accrued during the last several decades that human actors are able to solve some (but definitely not all) collective-action problems on their own without external rules and enforcement imposed from the outside. In this article. I review some of the structural variables that have been found to affect the likelihood of collective action. Then, I address the need to base future work on collective action on a more general theory of human behavior than has been used to model collective action over the last five decades. In the last section, I discuss how structural variables affect the core relationships of reputation, trust, and reciprocity as these affect levels of cooperation.
Information Science & Library Science	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between researchers' social media (SM) behavior and their academic performance. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 362 researchers was recruited from the colleges of management of 52 Chinese universities. A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test. Findings The results indicate that Chinese general social media (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM. Research limitations/implications - The authors examined the researchers' SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior. Practical implications - It is suggested that universities apply academic social media ( ASM) indicators to measure researchers' contributions so that they self- regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms. Originality/value - This study analyzed scholars' GSM usage and academic performance, and the moderating effect of university level on the relationship between need for competence and relatedness and need for autonomy. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the scholarly SM usage literature.
Linguistics	Traditional top-down conceptions of language policy and planning have been questioned by recent perspectives that advocate more localized accounts of language policy concerns in real-life social contexts. Schiffman's (1996) conception of linguistic culture is one of these bottom-up approaches, which focuses on covert language policies. This study investigates some aspects of such covert orientations of speakers of the Mazandarani language towards their local vernacular in the bilingual Mazandarani-Farsi context of northern Iran. It specifically attempts to explore the current linguistic culture atmosphere in terms of assumptions, prejudices, attitudes, and stereotypes with regard to Mazandarani. These aspects of public belief are particularly investigated as referring to language use in 'social situations', 'professional contexts', 'education', and 'media'. A group of 106 participants responded to a questionnaire that was aimed at eliciting their views on these linguistic culture domains as well as their 'attitude' towards Mazandarani. The study indicates that although the participants show very positive emotional attitudes towards their local language, their actual linguistic culture appears to be strongly in favor of the official national language, i.e. Farsi. Some concerns are raised as to the implications of such a loving-but-not-living linguistic culture for a more realistic understanding of language policy and planning.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Trip expenditure, length of stay during the trip, size of the travel party, monthly household income, discovering new places and/or things, and getting away from daily routine, role, obligation, stress and troubles have significant influence on Hong Kong residents' destination choice. Hong Kong residents' destination choice is highly associated with trip characteristic in comparison to socio-demographics and travel motivation factors. Destinations close to Hong Kong can focus on packaging their products with shorter trip lengths and making the packages attractive to travel companions in addition to the travelers. Destinations that are relatively far away from Hong Kong should focus on packaging their products to attract the Hong Kong outbound travelers with longer trip lengths and plan activities that cater to individual needs.
Nursing	While nurses and midwives are in a unique position to identify and help victims of IPV, since they are often their first point of contact in the healthcare system, they need appropriate training. This study sought to examine the presence of IPV-related contents and the depth to which they are addressed in the bachelor's degree in Nursing and in the Midwifery specialisation programme. The study also explored lecturers' motivations for including IPV in their subjects. The methodology employed was qualitative. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 university lecturers who teach IPV contents in the Nursing degree and Midwifery specialisation programme. The study took place in Catalonia (Spain). The research shows that lecturers feel personally committed in the training for prevention and detection of IPV. The main teaching methodology is active, experiential and requires student activity. In all cases, the lecturers call for more time and spaces to be made available to carry out this training. It would be desirable for more time to be dedicated to nurses and midwives' university training in IPV. The topic should be approached with a more cross-disciplinary, systematised focus from all perspectives: health, psychological, social, ethical and legal. It is important that the training of teaching staff in IPV should be fostered and methodised. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Health Policy & Services	This paper examines the future sustainability of the Fijian Ministry of Health's (MoH) information and communication technology (ITC) system for patient management (PAT IS). PAT IS was developed with AusAID funding and, as the owner of the system, AusAID has no commercial competence or interest in further development of the system. Thus, the question that arises is: should Fiji adopt a commercially available patient administration system or retain the existing PAT IS? In-depth consultations with senior executives and line managers of units that were major users of PAT IS were undertaken. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussion approaches were utilised. The consensus or majority views of the users were that the existing PAT IS performed more than adequately. The future sustainability of the system is threatened by the lack of investment in resources (e. g. hardware maintenance and human resources) required to keep the system operating at its optimum. It was found that PATIS provides Fiji with a satisfactory patient administration system. The identified problems with the system are not related to the application per se but rather to an under-investment in resources for its utilisation.
Anthropology	"In spite of a long history of research in craniofacial biology the extent to which developmental cascades between the brain, the cranial base, and the face influences the evolution, development and variation of the skull, is not clear. This paper discusses aspects of these problems in terms a ""systems-model"" of morphological integration and modularity of human craniofacial morphology. This model proposes analysing morphological variation and evolution of the human skull by considering ontogenetic and evolutionary modifications of modules by local (cranial) as well as general (non-cranial) factors, which implies an organismal view on human skull evolution. For example, the size and shape of brain lobes have local effects on skull shape, moulding lateral basicranial morphology. These effects, which are relatively independent from midline cranial base variation, interact with the position and morphology of the mandible and the postero-superior limit of the ethmo-maxillary complex. Another local factor within the face includes changes of the size and shape of nasal cavity. However this cranial module is functionally integrated with a more general body system, such as respiratory apparatus and functionally linked with non-cranial factors such as body energetics, size and allometry. This paper suggests that a joint consideration of local and general factors likely improves the development of holistic hypotheses about human craniofacial evolution."
Ethnic Studies	In response to a changing immigration enforcement landscape, a growing number of studies have sought to understand the impact of immigration policy and practice on a new and growing population. Recent scholarship has uncovered layers of stratification within undocumented populations, while some scholars have argued that illegality is a master status. In this article, we argue that these two ideas are not in tension. That is, certain traits or identities (e.g., race or gender) can be master statuses while also exhibiting layers of stratification. While our understanding of illegality is consistent with the master status framework, we recognize variation within that category. Our point of departure is the recognition that the experiences of undocumented children differ greatly from those of undocumented adults. From this observation, we point to four salient axes of difference and stratification that shape varied and unequal pathways for undocumented youth and young adults: (1) educational access and attainment, (2) place; (3) race and ethnicity, and (4) Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status.
Development Studies	The traditionally inward focus of many higher education institutions in both the United States (US) and South Africa has often failed to address important urban issues beyond the university gates, confining most student and academic activity to the campus. Universities can create social change not just through their primary teaching and research functions, but also through the promotion of integration on and around their campuses. In addition, place-based activities that improve neighbourhoods can help to attract students and staff, as well as new businesses and services. In particular, they can foster the influx of young professionals and families seeking to help build open, safe, vibrant and diverse communities, which may represent a new model for South African socio-economic integration beyond the gated' framework. Accordingly, the University of Pretoria (UP) has sought to lead an urban renewal and social transformation project around its Hatfield campus.
Industrial Relations & Labor	We investigate long-term absenteeism in Norway, on the basis of register data covering 8 years and more than two million absence spells. Key findings are that: (1) a tighter labor market yields lower work resumption rates for persons who are absent, and higher relapse rates for persons who have already resumed work; and (2) the work resumption rates increase when sickness benefits are exhausted, but work resumptions at this stage tend to be short-lived.
Social Issues	This article explains how the most recommended treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, acts and interacts with users' bodies, sleep partners' bodies, and cultural discourses to produce emotions and practices that generate the subjectivity of a disabled or abled person. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with OSA patients, this article illustrates how introducing CPAP devices into patients' lives may disturb their sleep and breathing, diminish their independence, disfigure their appearance, and problematize intimacy with bed partners, thereby disrupting both the fleshy body and the culturally preferred image of a healthy, independent, and attractive individual. In response, many patients reject this treatment. (Dis)ability as a subjective state is shown to emerge from associations in a network composed of heterogeneous entities that have agency. That is, disabled subjectivity emerges when the device prevents individuals from accomplishing what they consider to be the essential and socially significant aspects of sleep and primarily its disembodied and interembodied aspects.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	"In territories of medical uncertainty, clinical encounters are highly contentious. To uncover maintaining mechanisms behind persistent conflicts, we explore the interactional dynamics of clinical encounters fused with medical uncertainty. Based on a thematic qualitative analysis of experiential texts from 385 people living with medically unexplained physical symptoms in Norway, UK, Ireland, USA and Canada, we explore patients' main expectations, how these expectations are met, and how their expectations and experiences are socially constructed and structurally conditioned. Five fundamental expectations are identified: Health professionals ought to (1) acknowledge the lack of medical knowledge, and be frank, open and curious about it; (2) believe patient experiences and accept their condition as ""real""; (3) avoid blaming patients for their ailment; (4) demonstrate compassion, understanding and respect; and (5) share decision-making power with patients. Our participants experience unfulfilled expectations in all five areas. Both experiences and unfulfilled expectations are influenced by structural factors transpiring from the modern Western biomedical paradigm, and from cultural norms and values of its surrounding society. Structural and cultural forces obstruct team-oriented collaboration based on congruent understandings, mutual trust and reciprocated respect. Without such contextualisation, the interactional dynamics between patients and health professionals in clinical consultations cannot be exposed."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Technologies have dramatically transformed tourist experience. However, research has largely focused on traveler attitudes and technology adoption rather than their experience with travel technologies. Taking a cross-country perspective, this study examines the role of technology readiness (TR) as a personality trait in shaping travelers' satisfaction with travel technologies, using airlines as a case study. Results of an online survey of travelers in Australia, China, and the United States revealed the moderating effects of the TR dimensions of optimism and innovativeness as well as country of residence on the relationships between perceived quality of technology-enabled services (TESs), satisfaction with TESs, overall satisfaction, and future behavior. These relationships were stronger among travelers with higher TR and varied across countries. The results suggest that tourism and hospitality service providers should incorporate measures of traveler TR and TESs' performance into their customer-experience monitoring system.
Economics	"This paper evaluates the effects of high-frequency US uncertainty shocks on China""s investment and bank loans through the mixed-frequency vector autoregression model. We find that time-stamped US uncertainty shocks generate partly heterogeneous impacts on China""s investment and bank loans. The responses of bank loans with different maturities and private-owned enterprise investment are consistent with the theoretical results and policy operations except for the pattern of state-owned enterprise investment in the face of uncertainty shocks. By further decomposing the state-owned enterprise investment, we reveal that the injection of government investment to state-owned enterprise biases the time-varying responses of state-owned enterprise investment to US uncertainty shocks. Compared to the single-frequency approach, the mixed frequency approach produces richer economic results and insights."
Business	"Purpose This paper aims to explore consumer behaviour on the popular anonymous social networking site (SNS) Yik Yak. It examines the reasons behind the turn to anonymous social networking and also considers the ways in which anonymity impacts consumers"" self-performances on SNS. Design/methodology/approach The study used a netnographic approach to explore Yik Yak across eight universities in Ireland and the UK. Data are based on observation and participation on the app. Screenshots on smart phones were the central method used to collect data. Data also included 12 in-depth interviews. Findings Young consumers are becoming fatigued by the negative effects of self-presentation on many SNS. By enabling consumers to engage in what they consider to be more authentic modes of being and interaction, Yik Yak provides respite from these pressures. Through the structures of its design, Yik Yak enables consumers to realise self-authentication in anonymised self-performances that engender a sense of virtue and social connection. Practical implications - This research highlights the potential value of anonymous SNS in fostering supportive dialogue, concerning mental health amongst post-millennials. Originality/value - By invoking a performative lens, this paper extends a novel theoretical approach to understandings of identity formation within consumer research. By highlighting anonymity as a dynamic process of socio-material enactments, the study reveals how consumers"" self-performances are brought into effect through the citation of various discursive arrangements, which promulgate distinct understandings of authenticity."
Cultural Studies	African culture has suffered a serious neglect since the attainment of independence in the 1960s by many of the countries of Africa. This appalling situation has been caused mainly by the imposition of the colonial master's foreign language. These cultures have indeed ruptured the autochthonous African traditions thereby making some Africans alien to their cultures. This paper, as a way of introduction, clarifies the relationship between humanities and pure sciences. It examines, as part of humanistic studies, the literary creation of the pre-independence period of Africa as presented by the Negritude movement. While making a case for the renaissance of the fading African cultures through some of the Negritude postulations, it seeks to re-evaluate the Negritude concept and position vis-a-vis other cultures of the world and advocate a fruitful symbiosis where one culture does not inferiorize the other. Some Negritude works, especially the poems of Leopold Sedar Senghor, Birago Diop, David Diop, and Camara Laye are analyzed with a view to advocating a regeneration of African traditions. This paper concludes that while cultural symbiosis needs to be encouraged, African cultural values must be protected from total domination by foreign influences.
Cultural Studies	The authors explore how the multi-media artist Farniyaz Zaker uses words to establish connections between different kinds of materials in her work, and how her work makes words material. Zaker's conception of dress as microcosmic dwelling places' enables the authors to think about veiling practices, Islams and gender not only in relation to the familiar domains of state, piety, subjectivity, consumption, capitalism, public and private (for instance), but also with regard to some less self-evidently relevant contexts. Light, architecture and cinema, as well as walls, windows, curtains, coffins, tents and screens, are among them. It is by way of these multiple refractions that the authors are able to return to those debates that conceive of Islamic veiling in terms of embodied, material practices and to support and develop further reasons for an understanding of that most exceptionally charged piece of material, the veil, as more than a sign of...
Economics	"Today, financial and economic education is a primary issue in academia and among policy makers, and there is great interest towards programmes that are able to boost it. In this paper, we test whether a programme (""treatment"") of financial education on savings, targeted to children aged 8 and 9 is effective and to what extent. We measure the interest rate required by the children before and after the treatment to accept postponing a reward, computing its variation and comparing this with that of a control group. We find evidence that the overall initiative is helpful in decreasing the level of impatience of children and the number of inconsistent choices of boys. Our findings invite to reflect on the gender neutrality of programmes of financial education."
Family Studies	In Australia, there has been considerable interest in recent years in the policy and practical implications of sharing parental care and responsibilities after separation concepts that have culminated in the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006 While there is now good information on the prevalence, demography and dynamics surrounding different patterns of parenting after separation, not a great deal is known about the extent to which patterns change for individual families over time. This article reviews international and Australian studies that shed light on the stability of post-separation parenting arrangements in relation to shared and sole care. The notion of 'stability' is shown to have several dimensions, not all of which are necessarily beneficial to children. The implications of placing a greater focus on how post-separation parenting arrangements evolve over time are discussed in the context of child focused dispute resolution and decision-making.
Gerontology	Objectives To assess the influence of subjective word-finding difficulty on degree of engagement in social leisure activities among individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Design Analysis of data collected from the second cohort of the Multicenter Study of Predictors of Disease Course in Alzheimer's disease. Setting Four study sites in the United States and France. Participants Individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate AD (N=236). Measurements On separate questionnaires, participants were asked to 1) report whether they had trouble finding the right word when speaking (subjective word-finding difficulty) and 2) rate their frequency and enjoyment of social and nonsocial leisure activities. Objective language measures included object naming and verbal fluency. Measures of dependence, depression, cognitive status, age, sex, and education were also included as covariates in regression analyses. Results Fifty-two percent of the sample reported word-finding difficulty, and subjective complaints were correlated with poorer verbal fluency scores. Subjective word-finding difficulty was selectively related to social but not nonsocial activity measures. Endorsers of word-finding difficulty reported less frequency and enjoyment of social leisure activities, controlling for effects of covariates and objective word-finding ability. In contrast, lower engagement in nonsocial activities was associated with older age and higher depression scores but not with word-finding complaints. Caregivers' reports of study participants' activities corroborated these results. Conclusion Individuals with AD who are aware of increasing word-finding failures are less likely to participate in and enjoy socially oriented leisure activities. This finding may have significant implications for clinical and health outcomes in AD. Failure to evaluate subjective language complaints could result in social withdrawal symptoms, threatening the individual's quality of life and increasing caregiver burden. Reduced social interaction may ultimately exacerbate language symptoms over time.
History	Anti-Semitism in the Dutch labour movement has not been studied sufficiently. This is certainly true with regard to Ferdinand Dome la Nieuwenhuis and the early socialist movement in the nineteenth century. However, we have to take anti-Jewish propaganda into account in order to understand why the Jewish proletariat joined the socialist ranks at such a late stage, only after the reformist wing split from Dome la's Social Democratic League (SDB) into the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP) in 1894. This article aims to address this lacuna, and demonstrates that Dome la had been using Anti-Semitic stereotyping against the parliamentary-orientated reformists, because his main rival P.J. Troelstra was dependent on a modest group of Jewish diamond labourers in Amsterdam. Once the conflict was over Anti-Semitism faded into the background again.
Geography	Driving forces facilitate or inhibit land-use / land-cover change. Human driving forces include political, economic, cultural, and social attributes that often change across time and space. Remotely sensed imagery provides regional land-change data for the Northern Piedmont, an ecoregion of the United States that continued to urbanize after 1970 through conversion of agricultural and forest land covers to developed uses. Eight major driving forces facilitated most of the land conversion; other drivers inhibited or slowed change. A synergistic web of drivers may be more important in understanding land change than individual drivers by themselves.
Linguistics	Adjectives exhibit conspicuously different properties from one language to another. They sometimes show properties in common with nouns, sometimes with verbs, and sometimes with neither, and their inventory ranges from many to few or even none. Skepticism with regard to their universality was earlier raised by R. M. W. Dixon, but his later shift in favor of universality has brought the issue back into the foreground. The Northern Iroquoian languages are challenging in this regard, since they have resisted attempts to define even an adjectival subclass of verb roots. After a discussion of adjective function that aims at explaining their varying manifestations across languages, eight possible ways of characterizing an adjective class in one of the Northern Iroquoian languages, Seneca, are examined and each is found problematic. The only Southern Iroquoian language, Cherokee, does exhibit an adjective class that evidently arose subsequent to the north-south split.
Economics	India has some peculiarities: First, the increase of high technology has turn India into an attractive location for investors. However, its human development rate is relatively low, since India occupies the position 126 in the world (UNDP Report 2005). Moreover, there are important gender inequalities, rural poverty and inequalities between North and South regions. Therefore, one of the main Indian challenges are improving human development and reducing inequalities at every level. One of the tools that may be used to reduce poverty are microfinance programs. In this paper we will try to investigate the most important microfinance programs developed and successfully implemented in South India, as well as future perspectives of these organizations that are working since very recently in Southern India.
Communication	This study explores the presence of science programs on the Flemish public broadcaster between 1997 and 2002. Our data show that for nearly all variables 2000 can be marked as a year in which the downward spiral for science on television was reversed. This is attributed to 1) public service philosophy, 2) a strong governmental science policy providing structural government support, and 3) the reflection of a societal discourse that articulates a need for more hard sciences.
Social Work	The Working Alliance Inventory remains a widely studied measure of quality of therapeutic relationships between the practitioner and client. No prior study has examined the psychometrics and validity of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short (WAI-S) in a sample of families, social workers, and trained observers within child protection services. Surveys were completed by 130 families, social workers concerning 274 cases, and observers following 165 home visits during the first wave of data collected from a randomized controlled trial of child protection services. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on three versions of the WAI-S and demonstrated moderate to good model fit. Convergent construct validity was found with other standardized measures. Results support the use of the WAI-S during in child protection services practice and research. Future research into family engagement in child protection social work services should focus on the working relationship.
Area Studies	This article draws oat newspaper commentary, Nyaturu hunger lore, and ethnographic research to describe how central Tanzatiialt villagers accessed food aid from the state during the last African food crisis of 2006. Through leveraging their political support and their participation in national development agendas, rural inhabitants claimed their rights. Yet. it was through these exchanges that the state converted food aid into political power. The article argues that the highly ritualized gift of food aid naturalizes a contemporary political and economic order ill which, counterintuitively, it is rural farmers who go hungry.
History & Philosophy Of Science	This paper investigates the relationship between Helmholtz's formulation of the principle of the conservation of force and the two principles well known in rational mechanics as the principle of vis viva and the principle of the conservation of vis viva. An examination of the relevant literature from Leibniz to Duhamel reveals both Helmholtz's indebtedness to that tradition and his creative refashioning of it as he endeavoured to craft an argument that would both prohibit the construction of a perpetuum mobile and the efficacy of a supposed vital force and demonstrate the necessity of an ontology of mass points subject to attractive and repulsive central forces depending solely on distance.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Collaboration involves direct and open communication and respect for different perspectives. In particular, religious literature has many references to collaboration. This study is a report of knowledge synthesis based on qualitative systematic review by content analysis. The study surveys the concept of collaboration from the Islamic point of view and intends to answer the question, 'Does the Quran deal with the use of collaboration in human activities?' This study was conducted using electronic documents from websites related to Islamic and Quran sciences, such as Howzah.net, Nashriat.ir, Tebyan.net and Google Scholar from 1950 until 2013 by focusing on the keywords, collaboration and Islam, and then retrieving the Islamic document (Quran and Hadith). The language in which the search was conducted was English and Persian. Nearly, 28 articles and 72 books related to this topic were found and after applying the search criteria, only 13 % of the references were found to be applicable. In the Quran, collaboration is equivalent to Taavon, and Muslims are requested to collaborate in their affairs and never collaborate with each other for illegal affairs. Islam asserts that everyone requires social relationship in their life. God has enacted mutual rights for people and meeting these requirements is only possible through collaboration and respecting mutual rights.
Development Studies	The developmental state remains one of the chief points of reference, both analytical and political, for those who reject the current neoliberal global order. In this paper the validity of this approach is examined theoretically and historically. After a preliminary description of the developmental state, the paper investigates in turn the four terms contained in the title-neoliberalism, globality, the state and development-from a historical materialist standpoint. It is then argued that any approach that aims to provide an effective roadmap for a progressive alternative to neoliberalism needs to centre its analysis on the Marxian concept of class.
Substance Abuse	Background: Information on e-cigarettes among youth in the Russian Federation is lacking. Objective: We examined prevalence of and factors associated with youth e-cigarette use in the Russian Federation. Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous survey, conducted among 716 (females 51.5%) high school students in three cities (i.e., Ufa, Sterlitamak, Karagaevo) within the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russian Federation in 2015, assessed e-cigarette use and its correlates (i.e., sex, age, ethnicity, family structure, parents' highest degrees, antisocial behaviors, stress coping strategies, lifetime cigarette, hookah, alcohol, and marijuana use). Results: Lifetime use of e-cigarettes was 28.6% and past-30-day use was 2.2%. Multilevel modeling showed that belonging to Tatar/Bashkir ethnicity relative to Russian ethnicity (OR = 1.60) and lifetime use of cigarettes (OR = 21.64), hookah (OR = 4.21), and alcohol (OR = 1.90) was associated with greater odds of lifetime use of e-cigarettes. Furthermore, use of social support coping strategies (i.e., utilizing parents for support) were associated with lower odds of lifetime use of e-cigarettes (OR = 0.94). Conclusions: Despite high lifetime e-cigarette use, past-30-day use was low. Greater knowledge of the reasons for e-cigarette discontinuation through continued surveillance is needed in the Russian Federation. Social coping strategies involving parents may inform e-cigarette use prevention.
Law	"Despite the fact that Article III judges hold particular seats on particular courts, the federal system rests on judicial interchangeability. Hundreds of judges visit other courts each year and collectively help decide thousands of appeals. Anyone from a retired Supreme Court Justice to a judge from the U.S. Court of International Trade to a district judge from out of circuit may come and hear cases on a given court of appeals. Although much has been written about the structure of the federal courts and the nature of Article III judgeships, little attention has been paid to the phenomenon of sitting by designation how it came to be, how it functions today, and what it reveals about the judiciary more broadly. This Article offers an overdue account of visiting judges. It begins by providing an origin story, showing how the current practice stems from two radically different traditions. The first saw judges as fixed geographically, and allowed for visitors only as a stopgap measure when individual judges fell ill or courts fell into arrears with their cases. The second assumed greater fluidity within the courts, requiring Supreme Court Justices to ride circuit to visit different regions and act as trial and appellate judges for the first half of the Court""s history. These two traditions together provide the critical context for modern-day visiting. The Article then presents a thick descriptive analysis of contemporary practice. Relying on both qualitative and quantitative data, it brings to light the numerous differences in how the courts of appeals use outside judges today. While some courts regularly rely on visitors for workload relief, others bring in visiting judges to instruct them on the inner workings of the circuit, and another eschews having visitors altogether in part because the practice was once thought to be used for political ends. These findings raise vital questions about inter- and intra-circuit consistency, the dissemination of culture and institutional knowledge within the courts, and the substitutability of federal judges. The Article concludes by taking up these questions, reflecting on the implications of visiting judges for the federal courts as a whole."
Management	The aim of this paper is to investigate how the development process of small and medium-sized enterprise ( SME) marketing networks is carried out, in terms of organizational and managerial activities, in successful networks compared to unsuccessful ones. In other words, this study investigates which activities are carried out in successful ( compared to unsuccessful) SME marketing networks and how they are carried out. Although much attention has been focused on this phenomenon by both academics and practitioners, a high percentage of networks still fail. A qualitative approach based on multiple case studies allowed me to provide managers with a series of guidelines regarding the development process of successful SME marketing networks. The present study therefore represents a noteworthy academic contribution to marketing network theory and practice.
Management	Previous studies of Chinese leadership have identified Daoism as the main philosophical tradition that makes Chinese leadership behaviour different from western leadership behaviour in terms of its modesty, harmony and submissiveness to authority. However, less attention has been paid to Chinese managers' own perceptions and representations of traditional thinking in Daoist Wu Wei. In this article, we offer a new, more nuanced understanding of Daoist Wu Wei. We critically explored the link between Wu Wei and self-reflexivity. As a result, this study offers a new understanding of the influence of Daoism on leadership by showing that our participants exhibited three different forms of reflexivity in their ways of believing in Wu Wei, namely: flow, self-protection and an excuse for failing.
Nursing	Background Nurses who care for children must be competent to perform medication dosage calculations because most pediatric doses are weight based and obtained from adult formulations. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to describe and compare nurse performance on a medication dosage calculation assessment tool, considering work unit, years experience, and certification status. Design: A secondary analysis of data from 851 Registered Nurses (RN) was completed. Multiple regression was used to model the effect of work unit, certification, and experience on score. Findings: The mean assessment tool score was 92.4 (47-100). The work unit and the interaction between certification status and experience were significant in relation to score on the calculation assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
History	This article traces the history of the Constance Naden memorial bust, commissioned in 1890 and now held in the Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham. We describe the commissioning, funding and creation process, and analyse its purpose in terms of memorialization, its negotiation of gender, and how it portrays Naden as a poet, philosopher and scientist. The enduring legacies of, and reactions to the bust, are considered in the context of Birmingham's Mason Science College, where Naden studied between 1881 and 1887. We argue that Naden's bust is symptomatic of the University of Birmingham establishing its identity and that the subsequent changes in its location within the institution signify the shifting role of Naden within that legacy. Our reading of this sculptural artefact leads to several broader observations regarding poetic identity, gender, genius and female education, the establishment of universities and consolidation of civic identities via sculpture, and the memorialization of the poet. While a surface reading of the bust obscures the multifaceted nature of Naden's intellectual career, by attending to it more closely, turning the object on its plinth and locating it in its physical contexts over time, a far richer and more accurate view of the object, the person and her place in history becomes apparent.
Economics	We conduct a natural field experiment to test for the effect of framing on prices paid in two customer -selected price mechanisms. In two framing conditions, we sell a soft drink and provide customers with a reference price for this drink. In the pay-what-you-want (PWYW) condition, customers are told that they can pay much as they want. In the inark-off-your-own-price (MOYOP) condition, customers are told that they can reduce the price by as much as they want. We find that prices are significantly lower and that more customers choose a price of zero in the MOYOP compared to the PWYW condition. We conjecture that the explicit request to reduce the price in MOYOP is a strong signal for customers to adjust their perception of the appropriate price downwards. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Ethics	We know that animals are harmed in plant production. Unfortunately, though, we know very little about the scale of the problem. This matters for two reasons. First, we can't decide how many resources to devote to the problem without a better sense of its scope. Second, this information shortage throws a wrench in arguments for veganism, since it's always possible that a diet that contains animal products is complicit in fewer deaths than a diet that avoids them. In this paper, then, we have two aims: first, we want to collect and analyze all the available information about animal death associated with plant agriculture; second, we try to show just how difficult it's to come up with a plausible estimate of how many animals are killed by plant agriculture, and not just because of a lack of empirical information. Additionally, we show that there are significant philosophical questions associated with interpreting the available data-questions such that different answers generate dramatically different estimates of the scope of the problem. Finally, we document current trends in plant agriculture that cause little or no collateral harm to animals, trends which suggest that field animal deaths are a historically contingent problem that in future may be reduced or eliminated altogether.
Urban Studies	Changes in cities affect public squares. They host temporal, virtual and conflicting uses at different times. For these reasons, they must be multifunctional and adaptable to rapid and unpredictable changes to meet the users' needs which change over time. These changes have repercussions on the planning and the development of these spaces. In this context, planners introduce flexibility of use in urban planning as a feature of adapting spaces to changes. Current references cite characters and models of flexible places, as well as flexible uses of these places. However, how can planners improve the potential of the flexibility of use in existing public squares? This article proposes an approach to assess the flexibility of use in public squares. It requires the combination of two relevant qualitative methods used to evaluate the flexibility of use in buildings. We used them because there is still no evaluation method for public squares. The application of this method in the central square of the Grand Poste in Algiers aims to show the degree of flexibility of this place and identify aspects that help planners and architects to propose planning recommendations for more flexibility in using this square.
Public Administration	At present, there are a limited number of researches about the relation between certain economic and non-profit indicators and the evolution of non-profit organisations. Therefore, is it possible that the importance of this question is also reflected in the existence of the possibility to measure the non-profit sector of an individual country and its influence on the evolution of the crisis? Whether the non-profit organisations can be potential actors/partners in helping resolve our social, economic and political tensions, originated by the current economic crisis? England can be a particularly interesting example for our analysis. This is because the English non-profit sector can be considered as a considerably institutionalised system, which is also separate from state. Furthermore, this system plays an important role in national economy as employer and also as public service provider. It is also characterized by a strong contractual culture. In Hungary, the situation is completely different. Therefore, in this situation of economic crisis, the non-profit sectors of the two countries are more comparable and the differences and similarities can be pointed out.
Nursing	This article reports the findings of an evaluation of a training course for care workers who care for people with dementia in the community. Twenty-four care workers participated in the training which took place in London and Surrey, United Kingdom. The training had a significant positive impact on participants' confidence in understanding the experiences and social care needs of people with young onset dementia (YOD) and their families. Participants also perceived that the training would help them improve their working practice by furthering their understanding of practical approaches to supporting and caring for people with dementia in general. Additionally, participants reported many ways in which they perceived being able to specifically support and empower people with YOD. It was concluded that the short training course improved knowledge and confidence for care workers on dementia care, and specifically in understanding how to support people with YOD and their families. Dementia specific training should be considered by service managers as a way of potentially increasing care worker job satisfaction. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
History	Over the course of the German occupation of the British Channel Islands from 1940 to 1945, a number of letters of denunciation were sent by islanders to the German authorities, accusing fellow islanders of violations of occupation law or of anti-German activity of one sort or another. The German occupiers were ambivalent toward the denunciations. While recognizing their usefulness in maintaining order and the respect for German rule, they found both the letters and their writers distasteful. The local British authorities in Jersey and Guernsey also found the letters problematic; the consequences for the individuals targeted in the letters could be dire, and the impact on island society as a whole was significant, both during the occupation and beyond liberation in May 1945. The extent and nature of resistance and collaboration have been contentious issues in the historiography of the occupation of the Channel Islands, and these letters have been cited as evidence that islanders were unduly cooperative with the Nazis. This article examines the surviving letters of denunciation, and by placing them into the wider contexts of Nazi Europe and the historiography of denunciation in totalitarian states, argues that denunciation in the Channel Islands, far from being exceptional, was quite typical of the practice throughout the Nazi empire.
Substance Abuse	"This qualitative study, based on a series of 30 in-depth interviews and 109 economic surveys conducted with active heroin users residing in and around Detroit, Michigan, describes reported patterns of heroin use and income generation activities. In spite of lack of access to regular, legal employment, we found that many participants displayed a dedication to regular daily routine and a sense of risk management or control. These findings are discussed relative to past research on heroin addiction as well as recent research on the changing nature of employment. We argue that this sample fits somewhere in between the controlled or working addict, and the ""junkie"" or ""righteous dope fiend"" of urban lore. We draw a connection between these stable patterns of addiction and income generation and the demands of informal and insecure labor markets. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for further research, interventions, and public policy."
Linguistics	In the context of multilingualism in later medieval Britain, the influx of French terminology into the emerging technical vocabulary of Middle English is likely to have produced synchronous synonyms. For functional reasons, some native terms are expected to be dropped from the language, others to undergo differentiation through semantic shift. A significant proportion of the French borrowings are often seen as having been new technical terms, but earlier historical research on the nature of technical vocabulary in English has not clearly characterized this lexical domain; ways are therefore explored here of identifying technical terminology in this period. Definitions contained in historical dictionaries, principally the Middle English Dictionary, provide the main diagnostic, specificity of meaning. As a case study, borrowings in a technical register are examined using the terms contained in the subdomain Instruments' within the Middle English vocabulary for Building (extracted from the Bilingual Thesaurus of Everyday Life in Medieval England project) supplemented with lexis from the Historical Thesaurus. Utilizing the components of meaning in the Middle English Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary definitions, the lexical items are classified into semantic hierarchies as was done for the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary. In addition to dates of first usage, etymological information about the lexical items is included in the semantic hierarchies, allowing analysis of patterns of replacement by borrowed terms at different levels of the lexicon. It is found that the impact of French on the native lexicon in this dataset is most evident at the superordinate and basic levels of the lexicon, where we find almost equal numbers of native and borrowed terms, while at the hyponymic level native terms are in the vast majority. The study provides an insight into the vocabulary of speakers of the Middle English period with a high level of experience and expertise in technical fields and the findings suggest a resistance to borrowed vocabulary not at the lowest section of the social stratum, but rather by the class of skilled workers.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: Persons with intellectual disabilities have low physical activity levels and high rates of chronic disease. One predictor limitedly explored is the home environment, which could influence the type and amount of physical activity in this population. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore physical activity in the group home setting and determine what key stakeholders want from a physical activity programme. Method: This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design, using semistructured focus groups. Twenty stakeholders (i.e., residents with intellectual disability, support staff and programme coordinators) participated in one of three focus groups, separated by stakeholder status. Results: A number of factors emerged that would assist rehabilitation professionals in understanding physical activity within the group home setting. The following six meta-themes were identified: nature of residents' physical activity, facilitators to physical activity, barriers to physical activity, personal factors, organizational factors and solutions to increase physical activity. Conclusions: Findings suggest that residents with intellectual disabilities have low physical activity and opportunities for participation. Key attributes of the group home setting were identified between barriers and facilitators to activity. Consideration for the development of physical activity programmes should focus on the unique needs of the group home setting as expressed by stakeholders. Implications for rehabilitation Physical activity can improve physical fitness, function, and community participation yet physical activity remains low among adults with intellectual disabilities. Understanding physical activity within the group home setting is essential to develop targeted interventions to increase activity within that environment. Key barriers for physical activity within the group home setting include; operational priorities, limited staff, staff turnover, busy schedules, and staff attitudes towards physical activity.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	This article aims to analyze the development of pharmaceutical services in the context of the primary health care (PHC) in the period 2008-2014, focusing on selection, procurement and financing of medicines. A retrospective study was undertaken, using as data sources administrative documents of Rio de Janeiro Municipality Health Secretariat (SMS-RJ) as well as secondary database. We found a growth of numbers medicines offered for PHC of 57 items in 2008 to 222 in 2014. Actual spending on drugs paid by the city has grown 38% in the period, with a reversal from 2010, of the proportion of PHC related to tertiary care drugs, reaching 2.4 times in 2014, the year that public spending on medicines per capita of PHC was 9% greater than the value agreed between the three federal levels. It can be concluded that there have been important changes in pharmaceutical services in Rio de Janeiro Municipality in the period following the reform of PHC held in this territory, with increasing the conditions for therapeutic coverage and increased drug funding. The growth of per capita public spending on medicines above the agreed value raises the need to strengthen the rationalization of management measures.
Rehabilitation	The purpose of this article is to discuss recent changes in the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification Code of Professional Ethics for Rehabilitation Counselors, effective January 1, 2010, that are most relevant to rehabilitation counselor educators. The authors provide a brief overview of these key changes along with implications for ethical practice in rehabilitation counselor education.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	"Venue-based distribution of marijuana has become the normative model in the United States to obtain marijuana. This study examines one-time purchase behaviors at medical marijuana dispensaries (MMDs) to identify potential venue- and individual-level targets for prevention.We used a two-stage, venue-based sampling approach to randomly select patrons exiting 16 MMDs in Los Angeles, California during the spring of 2013. Patrons (N=595) reported their discrete purchase behaviors during their most recent visit to the sampled MMD. We used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the amount spent on marijuana products, regressed on characteristics of the sampled dispensaries and their patrons. We used hierarchical generalized linear modeling to examine the likelihood of purchasing specific types of marijuana products and total grams of loose-leaf buds purchased. Patrons spent US$41.73 on average, with a range of $0-$330. We observed significant variation in purchase behaviors across MMDs and associations between venues located within high median income census tracts and a higher total amount spent and lower odds of purchasing only loose-leaf buds. The networked distance between a patron""s home and the sampled MMD was positively associated with the total amount spent and total quantity of buds purchased. We also found significant relationships between medical conditions reported for use in three models: total amount spent, purchase of pre-rolled joints, and total grams of buds purchased. Policy makers may want to explore regulating the availability of specialty items that may be attractive to naive users, such as pre-rolled joints or edibles, or high-concentration products that may be sought out by regular, heavy users."
Geography	Despite the imperative that youth voices should contribute to shaping their future world, there is limited evidence of youth agency and participation which articulates their unique experience of community in urban planning decision-making. This study uses the lens of social capital to compare perspectives of community between young people aged 15-17 years and adults in a suburban community on the Sunshine Coast, South East Queensland, Australia. The results, derived from both quantitative and qualitative methods, illustrate the different experiences of community between youth and adults and suggest how urban planners and decision-makers can incorporate youth-friendly responses to address issues of power inequality between youth and adult residents and mechanisms to engage adult residents through collaborative governance approaches.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Overall attendance at bowl games has steadily decreased since. 2010, meaning that, institutions are often left with tickets they cannot sell. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the drivers of spectator attendance at college football bowl games through four competing econometric model's. The full model included 44 explanatory variables, and was examined using:both OLS and interval regression. A competing fixed-effects model is also presented. Finally, practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
Linguistics	In Optimality Theory with Candidate Chains (OT-CC; McCarthy 2007), candidates are multi-step derivations, and precedence constraints, which regulate the order of derivational steps, can inspect entire candidate derivations. This means that OT-CC opens the door to certain kinds of 'global rules' - that is, effects in which the application or non-application of a process is decided with crucial reference to derivational history. This paper investigates what limits may exist on OT-CC's global rule powers, focusing on two forms of opacity which are possible under a theory where all rules apply simultaneously, but not under sequential rule application: mutual counterfeeding and mutual counterbleeding. It is shown that the original version of OT-CC allows none, but that each of them could be made possible with relatively simple revisions to the original theory. Possible examples of these forms of opacity are discussed.
Education & Educational Research	In this article I explore insights gained from participating in an exploratory, small-scale study led by the Enabling Education Network (EENET) in 17 schools in northern Zambia and five schools in Tanzania. Facilitating South-based research, while based in a Northern university, raises complex ethical issues about voice and control which are discussed in the article. The main aim of the study was to explore understandings of inclusive education at school and community level in northern Zambia and Tanzania in the light of government efforts to promote Education for All. Reflective writing, photo elicitation and participatory photography were some of the methods used to generate locally relevant knowledge about marginalisation from the educational process, although the focus here is primarily on the issue of disability as a cause of educational exclusion.
International Relations	The pro-democracy Arab popular uprisings have been spontaneous, but perhaps not all that unpredictable. They have come against the backdrop of a growing gulf between the rulers and the ruled, political repression, social and economic inequalities, demographic changes, unemployment and foreign policy debacles. Although the uprisings began in Tunisia, it is the case of Egypt that illustrates the situation more compellingly and the impact that it has had on the rest of the Arab world. It is not clear at this stage what will be the ultimate outcome. But what can be said with certainty is that the Arab peoples have set out on a long journey in pursuit of genuine self-determination. The journey will be arduous and unsettling for the Arabs and outsiders, but this has to be treated as part of a transition from a dictatorial past to a politically pluralist future.
Education & Educational Research	In this article, I reflect on Nelson Mandela's (Madiba, the clan name of Mandela) education legacy. I argue that Madiba's education legacy is constituted by three interrelated aspects: firstly, an education for non-violence guided by deliberation, compassion and reconciliation; secondly, education as responsibility towards the Other; and thirdly, education that cultivates a 'community of thinking'. Educational philosophy and theory would be richly informed by the compelling education legacy bequeathed us by Nelson Mandela.
Social Issues	"The academic study of philanthropy presupposes a comprehensive definition that guides inquiry into what, exactly, philanthropy is and why it matters. at present, though, no such well-thought-out definition exists. Scholars tend to explore various facets of philanthropy, according to their particular academic interests, but without a comprehensive understanding of its full meaning. This article attempts to correct this lack of synoptic understanding by surveying prominent instances of usage and definitions of philanthropia in the classical Greek era and synthesizing them into a overall framework for understanding its full classical meaning. In so doing, philanthropia is revealed to be a signal word, the meaning of which significantly evolved to reflect historically dominant philosophical and cultural trends in classical Greek society. This article concludes the exploration of this subject begun in an article published in the previous issue of NVSQ, titled ""On the Modern Meaning of Philanthropy."""
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In recent social network studies, exponential random graph (ERG) models have been used comprehensively to model global social network structure as a function of their local features. In this study, we describe the ERG models and demonstrate its use in modelling the changing communication network structure at Enron Corporation during the period of its disintegration. We illustrate the modelling on communication networks, and provide a new way of classifying networks and their performance based on the occurrence of their local features. Among several micro-level structures of ERG models, we find significant variation in the appearance of A2P (Alternating k-two-paths) network structure in the communication network during crisis period and non-crisis period. We also notice that the attribute of hierarchical positions of actors (i.e., high rank versus low rank staff) have impact on the evolution process of networks during crisis. These findings could be used in analyzing communication networks of dynamic project groups and their adaptation process during crisis which could lead to an improved understanding how communications network evolve and adapt during crisis.
Environmental Studies	Environmental change alters ecosystem functioning and may put the provision of services to human at risk. This paper presents a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the corresponding vulnerability for Europe, using a new framework designed to answer multidisciplinary policy relevant questions about the vulnerability of the human-environment system to global change. Scenarios were constructed for a range of possible changes in socio-economic trends, land uses and climate. These scenarios were used as inputs in a range of ecosystem models in order to assess the response of ecosystem function as well as the changes in the services they provide. The framework was used to relate the impacts of changing ecosystem service provision for four sectors in relation to each other, and to combine them with a simple, but generic index for societal adaptive capacity. By allowing analysis of different sectors, regions and development pathways, the vulnerability assessment provides a basis for discussion between stakeholders and policymakers about sustainable management of Europe's natural resources.
Business, Finance	This study examines how a particular set of calculative practices and classification systems helped to guide the emergency responses to the 2009 earthquake in Abruzzo, Italy. Accounting classifications worked in tandem with scientific classifications to define the seismic event as a site for exceptional governance, to demarcate the temporal and spatial boundaries, and to guide the immediate and subsequent healthcare-related humanitarian responses. Accounting classification schemes were borrowed and built by the local health authorities as the federal government made the provision of disaster relief funding contingent on the identification of additional and traceable earthquake-related expenditures. The analysis also shows the maneuvers that occurred around the accounting classifications as public healthcare providers attempted to use the classifications to solve day-to-day health treatment funding problems and the federal government tried to exert control at a distance. The analysis provided both contributes to our understanding of the governance of these exceptional events and brings to the fore the challenges associated with such humanitarian responses.

Substance Abuse	Aims: To explore the ways in which opioid-dependent parents accounted for their use of opioids and benzodiazepines during and after pregnancy. Methods: Longitudinal qualitative interviews [n = 45] with 19 opioid-dependent adults recruited in Scotland, UK, were held during the antenatal and post-natal period. Interviews focused on parenting and parenting support within the context of problem drug use and were analysed using a narrative informed, thematic analysis. Findings: The majority of participants described using benzodiazepines in addition to opioids. Almost all indicated a desire to stop or reduce opioid use, whereas cessation or reduction of benzodiazepines was rarely prioritised. In stark contrast to opioid dependence, benzodiazepine dependence was portrayed as unproblematic, therapeutic and acceptable in the context of family life. Whereas opioid dependence was framed as stigmatising, benzodiazepine use and dependence was normalised. An exception was benzodiazepine use by men which was occasionally associated with aggression and domestic abuse. Conclusions: Drug-dependent parents attach different meanings to opioid and benzodiazepine use and dependence in the context of parenthood. Divergent meanings, and stigma, may impact on stated commitment to stability or recovery from dependent drug-use. Attention should be paid to the way in which policy and practice regarding OST and benzodiazepines reflects this divergence.
Education, Special	Special education researchers conduct studies that can be considered replications. However, they do not often refer to them as replication studies. The purpose of this article is to consider the potential benefits of conceptualizing special education intervention research within a framework of systematic, conceptual replication. Specifically, we advocate for the value and importance of replication research that includes both closely aligned and distal conceptual replications. We acknowledge the challenges associated with conducting replications in applied school-based research and also provide recommendations for how to design, conduct, and report replication studies in special education research with the goal of supporting the identification of effective practices for individuals with disabilities.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: Contractures are common problems for the elderly with far reaching functional and medical consequences. The aim of this systematic literature review was to give an overview of contracture and to identify potential risk factors associated with contractures. Methods: A systematic literature search with two objectives limited to the last 10 years was performed to identify studies dealing with definition of contracture (objective 1 = O1) and with risk factors (objective 2 = O2). Predefined information including age, sample size, study design, setting, condition, joint, definition of contracture, mode of measurement, and whether inter- and/or intra-rater reliability were assessed, as well as risk factors of contracture were extracted. Results: One hundred and sixty one and 25 studies were retrieved. After applying exclusion criteria 47 studies (O1) and 3 studies (O2) remained. Only 9 studies (O1) provided a definition of contracture. In 3 studies (O2) several potential risk factors were identified. Conclusions: In most of the studies it seems that the presence of a contracture is equivalent with the presence of restriction in the range of motion (ROM) of a joint. Very little is known about risk factors for contractures. But it seems that immobility may play a pivotal role in the development of this condition.
Demography	When China's decades-long one-child policy was replaced by a two-child policy, the circumstances under which women intend to have a second child become of great concern. This study examines the determinants of women's second birth intention, as well as how the intention changes over time alongside changes in other life circumstances. Using panel data from the Jiangsu Fertility Intention and Behaviour Study (JFIBS, 2007, 2010), we find that women with more economic and familial/social resources are more likely to want a second child, while women who work in non-agriculture sectors and have higher decision-making power in the family are less inclined to have a second child. We also find that a sizeable increase of family income encourages women to upwardly revise their intention towards a desire for two children. The role of policy change on Chinese women's second birth intention is also discussed.
Business	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore strategies for visualizing the value of service-based offerings in a B2B context. By taking a process perspective on the offering life cycle, this paper also aims at distinguishing which visualization strategies are most appropriate using at which life-cycle stages. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a qualitative, multiple-case study research design involving five manufacturing firms. Findings - Primary findings are that firms need to make use of several different visualization strategies depending on, among other things, the key stakeholders and also where the firm's offering is currently positioned in the service-based offering life cycle. Research limitations/implications - While the empirical data is from only one sector - i.e. manufacturing - managers from other B2B sectors should have an interest in the results and the key aspects identified. Further research could also establish linkages to performance metrics. Originality/value - Visualization strategies have been relatively rarely studied from a B2B perspective, and the process dimension, especially, is novel.
Education, Special	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the I Can Use Effort strategy on the quality of student verbal contributions and IEP participation of third and fourth grade students with high-incidence disabilities. Using a multiple probe across participants design, results indicated a functional relationship between the I Can Use Effort strategy and the quality of students' verbal contributions related to the IEP process and students' learning strengths and preferences. The 5 lesson intervention improved all 4 students' ability to express their learning preferences and contribute information in an IEP meeting. In addition, measures of social validity demonstrated the social significance and appropriateness of the intervention's goals and procedures.
History & Philosophy Of Science	At the present time, there is considerable interest for the physical setting of science, that is, its actual 'place' of practice. Among historians of biology, place has been considered to be a crucial component for the study of ecology. Other historians have noted the 'built' environments (laboratories) for the study of biology along the seashore, even referring to these places in terms more applicable to vacation sites. In this paper, I examine the place of intertidal ecology investigations, both in terms of the physical space and the built space. Part of the examination will investigate the aesthetic aspect of the Pacific Coast, part will evaluate the unique character of the intertidal zone, and part will consider the construction of natural laboratories and built laboratories as characteristic places for biology.
Environmental Studies	"This article examines how the attributes of an urban location contribute to private property developers' use of transfer of development rights (TDR) in Taiwan. We use ""floating TDR"" to describe a deliberate design feature of the Taiwanese program the lack of legal requirement for planning designation of the receiving areas. The result is that planners have little control over where TDR takes place in the city even though TDR density bonus has been widely used in real estate development. A logistic regression model finds that TDR projects gravitate toward locations of certain attributes: growing neighborhoods, neighborhoods with higher household income, parcels with a slower increase in land price, and locations at a further distance from public facilities such as urban parks and mass transit stations. Real estate projects of a greater development volume and a smaller site area are also more likely to use TDR density bonus. This article concludes by reaffirming the important role of planning in the design and use of TDR as a market-enabling tool."
Family Studies	This study aimed to identify the reciprocal effect of coparenting as a predictor of maternal parenting stress, and the influence of maternal parenting stress on coparenting. Coparenting and parenting stress are two essential factors that influence child development. The sample included 412 Korean mothers who completed surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months after giving birth. The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form was used to assess parenting stress across three domains, and the Parenting Alliance Inventory was used to evaluate coparenting. The data analysis was conducted using structural equation modelling. The results demonstrated that the cross-lagged model between total parenting stress and coparenting showed a mixture of significant bidirectional and unidirectional effects depending on the time point. Additionally, the parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child domains had significant bidirectional effects on coparenting, while the parental distress domain had significant unidirectional effects on coparenting. Maternal parenting stress should be understood in the context of the coparenting relationship, as there are unique bidirectional associations between coparenting and each subdomain of parenting stress. We recommend including content in parenting education programmes to help mothers better understand their child's temperament to reduce maternal parenting stress and eventually induce positive behaviours in the child.
Communication	Highly publicized deaths of Black men during police encounters have inspired a renewed civil rights movement originating with a Twitter hashtag, Black Lives Matter. Supporters of the law enforcement community quickly countered with an intervention of their own, using the slogan, Blue Lives Matter. This project compared the discourses of their respective Facebook groups using cultural discourse analysis that considered words, images, and their symbiosis. Based on a foundation of structural Marxism as articulated by Althusser, this project found that the two groups' symbol systems are homologous with larger, ideological tensions in American culture: faith and reason.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The sociology of expectations has examined ways in which future expectations shape how technological options are selected and stabilised. Personal genomic susceptibility testing (PGST) is introduced as an example of a technology where expectations serve a crucial role, thanks to the inherently future-oriented nature of testing for genetic susceptibility to future health conditions. Nonetheless, expectations may increase rather than decrease scientific, regulatory and commercial uncertainties surrounding a technology. Technology promoters may therefore enact particular strategies to prove that technologies are not in need of stringent, technology-specific regulation. With the aid of an extensive historical analysis of company websites, together with semi-structured interviews with company representatives, it is shown how four PGST companies based in the United States have used efforts towards collaborative standardisation as ways of stabilising and legitimating PGST in an often hostile environment. We explore how these strategies make use of expectations, and how they centre on the promotion of new 'regulatory objects' in an effort to influence regulatory agendas. Although processes of standardisation in the PGST industry have stalled, we suggest that they nonetheless represent successful engagement with regulators, insofar as they have succeeded in shaping regulatory agendas and staving off new regulation.
Public Administration	Founded in 1907, the New York Bureau of Municipal Research was central to the emergence of American public administration. But in 1914, its Board sided with Frederick Cleveland against William Allen, deciding to guarantee Rockefeller funding by eliminating Allen's publicity and controversy-generating orientation. Allen quit, then founded the Institute for Public Service. He maintained it for nearly 50 years, producing a steady output of reform suggestions. This article recounts Allen's largely unknown post-1914 career. Increasingly an outsider, his later career presents a glimpse of an alternate history of public administration, distinctly different from the path the field actually chose.
Family Studies	This article focuses on the role of social reproduction tasks (motherhood and childcare) in the reproduction of cultures and the social incorporation of first-generation and second-generation immigrants. It draws upon a very particular case study of Vietnamese immigrant families that hire Czech nannies for their second-generation children. The article presents an analysis of 15 interviews with Vietnamese mothers who delegate(d) childcare and 20 interviews with second-generation Vietnamese children who have had a Czech nanny. It is based on the assumption that the social reproductive sphere includes not only the embodied work of childcare but also the work of reproducing cultures and social incorporation. Many scholars argue that the activities connected with childcare (usually called bridging' activities, including communication with public authorities and schools and participation in the local neighbourhood) that are traditionally performed by women take on a new dimension after migration. They become the means by which immigrant mothers are integrated and develop the social capital and skills that help them adapt to the new country. What happens in an immigrant family when caregiving (including the bridging activities) is delegated to another person? How does the role of the mother - with its limited content - shape the women's position in the new country? The aim of this study is to examine how both mothers and children make sense of the delegation of care and its consequences for the social incorporation of first-generation mothers who delegate care and for second-generation children who are cared for by nannies. Addressing this particular case of migrant mothers who perform a limited form of mothering, the paper illuminates the key role of motherhood in women's post-migratory integration and contributes to the scholarly discussion on the meanings of (migrant) motherhood.
Rehabilitation	Importance: The aging of the population is generating increased demand for occupational therapy practitioners to address the occupational performance of those experiencing low vision. Objective: This Practice Guideline, which is informed by systematic reviews on interventions for older adults with low vision, is meant to serve as a reference for occupational therapy practitioners to guide best practice in service delivery, improve quality of care, enhance consumer satisfaction, and justify occupational therapy services to external stakeholders. Interventions included in this guideline address performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), reading, and leisure and social participation. Method: We examined, synthesized, and integrated the results of three systematic reviews into recommendations for practice, education, and research. Results: Thirty-eight articles were included in the systematic reviews, which served as the basis for clinical recommendations. A case study describes translation and application of the recommendations to clinical practice. Conclusions and Recommendations: Strong evidence supports the role of occupational therapy for older adults with low vision. On the basis of the evidence, we recommend routine use of low vision rehabilitation for ADL and IADL impairments, multicomponent interventions to improve ADL and IADL performance and leisure and social participation, stand-based electronic magnification to enhance reading, and visual skills training to enhance reading for clients with a central field impairment. We recommend using client-centered problem-solving training to enhance ADL and IADL performance, reading, and leisure and social participation. Mainstream technology may be considered for use on a case-by-case basis to enhance reading performance. Finally, adapted tango may be considered for use on a case-by-case basis to enhance ADL and IADL performance and leisure and social participation. What This Article Adds: This Practice Guideline provides a summary of the current evidence supporting occupational therapy intervention for older adults with low vision. It summarizes the emerging literature supporting the use of mainstream technology and provides additional support for the use of multicomponent intervention strategies.
Management	The search for legitimacy is essential for all emerging companies in order to acquire resources. However, in the case of university spin-off, legitimacy must be sought from multiple stakeholders with different expectations. It also must be dealt with in all of its dimensions. The theoretical framework of legitimacy helped us to understand the reasons why the launch of a university spin-off might fail. A longitudinal and in-depth case study provide insights into previously unknown dynamics of the legitimation process and the impact of the search for legitimacy with different stakeholders on a nascent venture. It shows in particular that the socio-political dimension of legitimacy is central in the case of university spin-offs due to their original link with the university.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article presents analyses of how different definitions of disability affect the outcomes of studies of disabled people's living conditions. Three different definitions of disability are compared using six rather common variables: gender, age, living arrangements, education, labour market participation and income. Selected definitions of disability are administrative definitions, a subjective definition and a functional definition. Analyses were conducted using compilations of several databases in Sweden. Recurrent differences between administrative definitions, on the one hand, and functional and subjective definitions, on the other, are found in relation to educational and labour force variables. People defined by an administrative definition are more likely to be younger and single than the people defined by the other two definitions. More research on the impact of disability definitions is needed. However, a first step in resolving this question would be to improve the methodological awareness of disability researchers.
Anthropology	The paper examines Middle Holocene hunter-gatherer adaptive strategies in the Baikal region of Siberia based on diverse data (radiocarbon, mortuary, geochemical, genetic, human osteological, and zooarchaeological) accumulated over the last 10-15 years. The new model emphasizes the cyclical nature of the long-term changes and recognizes similarities between the Early Neolithic and Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age cultures. The overall impression seems to be that change in the region was rapid rather than gradual. A number of interesting correlations between various cultural and environmental variables have been identified. During the Early Neolithic and Late Neolithic-Bronze Age, the spatial distributions of mortuary sites, open landscape, and good fisheries are all correlated and both intervals are coeval with periods of environmental stability. For the Early Neolithic two additional sets of correlated variables have been identified: (1) the uneven distribution of fish resources, uneven distribution of the human population, and cultural heterogeneity; and (2) poorer overall community health, more extensive male travel and heavier workloads, and higher reliance on fishing. For the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age, the sets of correlated variables are somewhat different: (1) more even distribution of terrestrial game resources (herbivores), more even distribution of the human population, and cultural homogeneity; and (2) better overall community health, less travel and lighter workloads, more equitable distribution of labor between males and females, and higher reliance on game hunting. Viewed together, these patterns emphasize the much more dynamic pattern of hunter-gatherer cultural variability, temporally and spatially, compared to what was known before.

Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Individual differences on a framing problem and a reflection problem were examined in light of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The predictions on information processing style, derived from Jungian personality type theory, were tested for the much-discussed framing effect in the Asian Disease Problem and for the reflection effect on which the framing effect presumably depends. As anticipated, the results revealed that business students with higher iNtuition/Extraversion scores and lower Judging score were more likely to be consistently risk-seeking. Conversely, those with higher Sensing/Judging scores were more likely to be consistently risk-averse. Both framing and reflection effects were displayed by those with higher Sensing/Judging scores. However, the second expected result was not supported. Rather, a so-called 'gray hair/clouds' effect (effect name inspired by Medin and Shoben's research in 1988), questioning the validity of risk propensity, was observed and analyzed. The somewhat surprising results and their theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
Sociology	Drawing on recent developments in field theory, this article analyzes the struggle for survival of Sao Paulo's street vendors in the face of a massive eviction campaign. I conceive of street vending as a social field divided into two unequal categories-licensed street vendors and unlicensed street vendors-and show that responses to the campaign varied along group lines. Unlicensed peddlers either abandoned the field or drew on local networks to continue peddling under harsher conditions, whereas licensed street vendors relied on well-established ties to actors in the political field. After these ties proved ineffective, licensed street vendors survived thanks to the intervention of a non-governmental organization (NGO) that activated the judicial field and mobilized the legal capital vested in the licenses. The linkage role performed by this actor with cross-field networks and expertise shows the strategic import of interfield relations, which replicate and reinforce the unequal distribution of assets inside the field.
Economics	For a single equation in a system of linear equations, estimation by instrumental variables is the standard approach. In practice, however, it is often difficult to find valid instruments. This letter outlines a maximum-likelihood method that does not require instrumental variables; it is applied to the estimation of a demand function and an Engel curve.
Women'S Studies	Cases in which women have killed their sleeping or otherwise inattentive abusive partners to escape domestic violence have arisen in both Germany and Australia. In this context, the availability of defenses including provocation and self-defense for abused defendants is controversially debated due to their traditional application and interpretation. It appears that these cases have driven law reform and changed judicial interpretation of defenses to some degree in Australia, whereas the situation in Germany remains stagnant. This article argues that while the situation in Australia is not without criticism, the recent legislative developments aimed at affording abused defendants greater access to defenses could serve as food for legal thought in the German debate.
Social Issues	Over the past decade, an academic debate has developed surrounding qualitative data preservation and sharing in the social sciences, and has been characterised as one between supporters and opponents of this movement. We reframe the debate by suggesting that so-called 'opponents' are not resistant to the principle of data preservation and sharing, but ambivalent about how this principle is being put into practice. Specifically, qualitative researchers are uneasy about the foundational assumptions underpinning current data preservation and sharing policies and practices. Efforts to address these concerns argue that the inclusion of the 'contexts' of data generation, preservation and reuse will adequately resolve the epistemological concerns held by the qualitative research community. However, these 'solutions' reproduce foundational assumptions by treating 'context' as ontologically separate from, rather than constitutive of, data. The future of qualitative data preservation and sharing in the social sciences is dependent on shedding its implicit unitary foundational model of qualitative research, and embracing 'epistemic pluralism' and the diversity of philosophical perspectives representing the qualitative researcher community.
Health Policy & Services	Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite the widespread availability of evidence-based clinical guidelines and validated risk predication equations for prevention and management of CVD, their translation into routine practice is limited. We developed a multifaceted quality improvement intervention for CVD risk management which incorporates electronic decision support, patient risk communication tools, computerised audit and feedback tools, and monthly, peer-ranked performance feedback via a web portal. The intervention was implemented in a cluster randomised controlled trial in 60 primary healthcare services in Australia. Overall, there were improvements in risk factor recording and in prescribing of recommended treatments among under-treated individuals, but it is unclear how this intervention was used in practice and what factors promoted or hindered its use. This information is necessary to optimise intervention impact and maximally implement it in a post-trial context. In this study protocol, we outline our methods to conduct a theory-based, process evaluation of the intervention. Our aims are to understand how, why, and for whom the intervention produced the observed outcomes and to develop effective strategies for translation and dissemination. Methods/Design: We will conduct four discrete but inter-related studies taking a mixed methods approach. Our quantitative studies will examine (1) the longer term effectiveness of the intervention post-trial, (2) patient and health service level correlates with trial outcomes, and (3) the health economic impact of implementing the intervention at scale. The qualitative studies will (1) identify healthcare provider perspectives on implementation barriers and enablers and (2) use video ethnography and patient semi-structured interviews to understand how cardiovascular risk is communicated in the doctor/patient interaction both with and without the use of intervention. We will also assess the costs of implementing the intervention in Australian primary healthcare settings which will inform scale-up considerations. Discussion: This mixed methods evaluation will provide a detailed understanding of the process of implementing a quality improvement intervention and identify the factors that might influence scalability and sustainability.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	In policy evaluations, interest may focus on why a particular treatment works. One tool for understanding why treatments work is causal mediation analysis. In this essay, I focus on the assumptions needed to estimate mediation effects. I show that there is no gold standard method for the identification of causal mediation effects. In particular, mediation effects will always have the character of estimates from observational data since they are generally subject to a specific form of confounding. Additionally, I demonstrate how randomization of the mediator and instrumental variables methods lead to fundamentally different quantities than causal mediation analyses. I also review recent work that discusses how the assumptions of mediation analyses differ when there is treatment noncompliance or when there are multiple mediators. Throughout, I motivate concepts using path diagrams and an example of a classroom intervention designed to increase test scores.
Nursing	Insights from the social sciences, including geography, sociology, and anthropology, have long been incorporated into pre-registration nursing programmes. However, scholars have suggested that their inclusion has been sporadic and lacks clear theoretical rationale. In this paper we argue anew that the social sciences and particularly, human geography could be central to nurse education. Specifically, we recast the concept of 'biogeography' drawn from human geography that emphasises the interplay between life (bio) and place (geo) to propose pedagogy that theoretically justifies and practically enables the inclusion of the social sciences in nurse education. Biogeography can breathe new life into nursing curricula by animating our students through the cultivation of three 'spirits of nursing'. First, a 'spirit of empathy' that can shatter patient-professional dualisms by facilitating person-centred and place sensitive care. Second, a 'spirit of engagement' that situates practice in social structures awakening a desire to effect change by fomenting an acute sense of social justice. Third, a 'spirit of enquiry' that holds in critical tension the theory-practice gap by fostering continual questioning and pursuit of evidence. In so doing, biogeographical pedagogy releases the latent potential of the social sciences to revitalise nurse education, reinvigorate our students, and renew ourselves as nurse educators.

Ethnic Studies	This article reinforces the calls, including those articulated by the editors of this special issue, for scholarship that does not rely on an ethnic lens to study migrant practices, socialities and identities. We offer a concept of migrant emplacement that focuses analytical attention on the relationship between the economic, political and cultural positioning of cities within broader networks of power and the ability of migrants to forge a place for themselves within a specific locality. Using the example of Halle/Saale in eastern Germany but calling for comparative research, the article notes the synergies between urban regeneration and rebranding efforts and the emplacement of migrants in that city through local situated and transnationally connected small businesses. Time is also shown to be a factor: a welcoming ambience and opportunity structure in urban regeneration at one point can be replaced by a reduction in possibilities at a later period.
International Relations	This paper examines the use of short writing assignments in undergraduate international relations courses. It gives instructors ideas about thinking beyond traditional research papers and instead focuses on shorter assignments that demand critical thinking skills. The ability to write concisely is useful for students with future careers in government, business, nonprofits, journalism, electoral politics, or academia. By requiring application of theoretical frameworks (perhaps as policy recommendations in a memo), students can see how policymakers employ international relations theories, thereby simulating the work inside the National Security Council or US State Department. This highlights the connections between theory and policy. Short papers can also better showcase role playing and connect with active learning techniques. Research papers of 10 pages or more may not be as useful as shorter assignments that focus students' attention on analyzing an issue, presenting a case study, or writing a policy brief.
Substance Abuse	Relapse to substance abuse is a global problem and is conceptualized as an integral component of the recovery process. Global statistics on rates of relapse after substance abuse treatment are disturbingly high, averaging about 75% within a 3- to 6-month duration after treatment. This study sought to gain full understanding of the factors that precipitate relapse among substance abusers in Ghana. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 15 relapsed substance abusers who were previously treated for substance abuse, and three mental health professionals at a psychiatric rehabilitation unit in Ghana. Findings showed that seven factors, including positive/negative emotional reinforcements, sense of loss, interpersonal conflicts, peer influence, familial, religio-cultural, and treatment-based issues complot to instigate and maintain the relapse cycle. The findings provide valuable insights into the relapse phenomenon in Ghana. Clinicians should actively engage family members in the relapse prevention process, and provide insight into religio-cultural relapse precipitants.
Environmental Studies	There is consensus that payments for biodiversity services are a promising conservation tool, yet the implementation of applied schemes has been lagging behind. This paper explores some reasons why potential biodiversity buyers may hesitate. It describes the case of an unsuccessful attempt to establish a community conservation concession in the village of Setulang (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) to safeguard a biologically valuable area from predatory logging. Potential biodiversity donors did not engage in this payments-for-environmental-services scheme mainly because of their limited time horizon and uneasiness about the conditionality principle. Other complicating factors included overlapping land claims, and the diagnosis of the externality at hand. We conclude that new investment modalities and attitudes are needed if potential biodiversity buyers are to exploit the advantages of this innovative tool. We also provide some tangible recommendations on factors to consider when designing a compensation scheme for conservation at the community level.
Education, Special	This study investigated the extent to which problem behaviors were factors associated with response to a year-long multicomponent reading intervention for fourth- and fifth-grade students with reading difficulties. Students scoring <= 85 standard score on the Test of Silent Reading Efficiency and Comprehension (n = 108), a reading fluency and comprehension screener measure, were randomized to the researcher-provided treatment condition (n = 55) or the business-as-usual comparison condition (n = 53). Results indicated that problem behaviors were associated with lower reading comprehension outcomes. Findings also suggested that students with higher levels of overall problem behaviors and externalizing behaviors in the treatment condition outperformed similar students in the comparison condition on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test (p < .05). Future research is needed on how to best identify, develop, and adapt effective interventions for students with reading difficulties and problem behaviors within school-wide response to intervention frameworks.
Information Science & Library Science	"This paper reports on the results of an extensive search for information on Eugene Garfield on the World Wide Web. The searches took place in August 2001, using the search terms: ""Eugene Garfield"", ""Garfield Eugene"", ""Gene Garfield"", ""E. Garfield"" and ""Garfield E"". The five major search engines at that time were queried. 9711 different URLs were identified, out of which 4120 were related to Eugene Garfield, the information scientist. About 25% of these pages were characterized using the method of content analysis. The pages were classified into multiple facets: theme, substantiality, page type, publisher, creator, language, domain and site. The findings show that the most frequently mentioned themes (not surprisingly) were the use and theory of citation analysis, the Citation Indexes as products, the Impact Factor and the use of JCR data. Over 50% of the pages were scientific in nature and more than a third of the pages formally cited Garfield's work. The findings based on the 2001 dataset were not published before."
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Objective: This article provides an analysis of issues and empirical evidence related to literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in online health and cancer communication, and recommendations to improve cancer communication for diverse audiences. Methods: We examined English-language online literature and selected books and policy documents related to literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in health and cancer communication. Results: Studies about literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in online cancer communication for diverse audiences are limited, but have increased during the past 15 years. Empirical evidence and theoretical guidance describe the critical importance of these factors, significant unmet needs among low-literate, multicultural and non-English-speaking populations, and strategies to improve communication. Conclusion: Overall, online cancer communication has not met the literacy, cultural, and linguistic needs of diverse populations. The literature offers valuable recommendations about enhancing research, practice, and policy for better cancer communication. Practice implications: Practitioners should understand the strengths and weaknesses of online cancer communication for vulnerable groups, guide patients to better Websites, and supplement that information with oral and tailored communication.

Women'S Studies	This article is based on the findings of a study conducted by Sama-Resource Group for Women and Health to understand the implications of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) on the lives of women in the Indian context: to gauge the responses of the various social movements in the country on issues being raised by ARTs and to examine the state of regulation of ARTs in India. The article concludes that ARTs reinforce traditional patriarchal norms rather than challenge or subvert them. We suggest that the application of these technologies has in fact furthered the subjugation of women by firmly casting them in the role of 'child bearers'. Our review of the national regulatory guidelines identifies the gaps in the regulation of ART clinics and exposes the limited understanding of the authorities with regard to the social and ethical implications of these technologies for individual women and Indian society at large.

Environmental Studies	The need for an integrated oceans policy became a fundamental public policy issue for many coastal States following the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) in November 1994. Australia's Oceans Policy was released in December 1998 and sets the framework for integrated and ecosystem-based planning and management. Australian Oceans Policy resulted in the establishment of a robust biophysical understanding of the bioregions of Australia's oceans jurisdiction, particularly the exclusive economic zone. Australia's Oceans Policy also achieved engagement with sectors that had previously not been involved with oceans governance issues. Despite its achievements, the Australian Oceans Policy was not successful for a number of reasons. First, the Policy failed to achieve the support of the states comprising the federation of Australia, with the consequence that regional marine plans were not integrated with the 3 nautical miles jurisdiction of the states. Second, the Policy was transformed from a multi-ministerial/departmental integrated approach to a sectoral environmental activity with consultation. Third, management measures and performance criteria were not clearly spelled out. In the end, Australia's Oceans Policy became a sectoral solution and not an integrated one as was envisaged.
Geography	Transboundary Protected Areas as instruments of transborder co-operation? The case of the Nature Park Irottko-Geschriebenstein Transboundary Protected Areas (TBPA) represent a potential strategy for sustainable cross-border development. Experts consider them to be versatile tools for cross-border co-operation in the areas of environmental protection and peace building. Against the backdrop of public planning of these protected areascapes, the chapter will analyse the case of a TBPA nature park located alongside the Austro-Hungarian border. frottkii-Geschriebenstein Nature Park will serve as a model for discussing the framework conditions necessary for protected areas to play a role in cross-border co-operation at the interface of different political systems.Which mechanisms need to be considered for TBPA to act as stimuli or even models of regional development based on regional governance? Despite common ideas and statements in support of the cross-border nature park on the part of both Austria and Hungary, numerous barriers to co-operation seem to persist. From an analytical standpoint, trust, legal frameworks and jurisdictions, weak transfer links and bureaucracy, in addition to different manifestations of responsibilities as a civil society constitute those fields of action that are partly superimposed on the matters of content and need to be addressed on a deeper level in cross-border co-operation.
History	The special issue compares the central temporal concepts and chronopolitics of Italian Fascism, National Socialism and the Romanian Legion of the Archangel Michael. In our introduction we begin this venture by scrutinising the fascist alternative to the narrative of progress, its obsession with dynamism and revolution and the cult of speed. These elements are juxtaposed with fascism's anti-historicism and its mythic longing for an eternal order. We show the close nexus between fascism's momentum and its quest to unearth an eternal entity the nation or the Volk. We illustrate how the fascists united revolution and eternity, i.e. the destruction of the past with the restoration of origins, the beginning of a new era with the thousand-year standstill of time.
Education, Special	Richman et al. (J Appl Behav Anal 48:131-152, 2015) completed a meta-analytic analysis of single-case experimental design data on noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) for the treatment of problem behavior exhibited by individuals with developmental disabilities. Results showed that (1) NCR produced very large effect sizes for reduction in problem behavior, (2) NCR implemented with the functional reinforcer resulted in a slightly larger effect size compared to NCR using nonfunctional reinforcers, and (3) schedule thinning for the delivery of reinforcers typically produced temporary and modest increases in levels of problem behavior. The purpose of the current study was to conduct follow-up analyses to determine whether treatment implementation setting, topography, or the function of problem behavior influenced the treatment effect size for problem behavior exhibited by individuals with developmental disabilities. Follow-up analyses showed that NCR effect sizes were very similar across inpatient and outpatient settings and across aggression and property destruction versus self-injurious behaviors. Results showed that NCR effect size for treatment of problem behavior maintained by a form of social reinforcement was slightly greater than problem behavior maintained by automatic reinforcement. Results are discussed in terms of applying NCR in school settings as an initial treatment for problem behaviors that can interfere with academic, adaptive, and vocational skill acquisition for students with developmental disabilities.
Linguistics	This article reports on a co-produced project introducing an innovative, drama-based method for enhancing UK HE students' intercultural learning. We ran two workshops for a mixed cohort of students and demonstrate in our analysis how these decentred language as the chief vehicle of communication, treating language as one of many materials in the communicative assemblage. This facilitated new ways of knowing-through-being for the participants, which enabled them to move across perceived intercultural boundaries and to bring new boundaries into existence in an ongoing process of becoming. We offer this analysis as grounds for a more ethical internationalisation of higher education.
Development Studies	Martha Nussbaum raised profound concerns about aid as being conceived out of the self-directed charity of donors and not the expressed concerns of those being aided. Even when the recipients of aid seek to express their concerns, their capabilities may not recognise their own conditions and desirable remedies. This paper agrees that Nussbaum's questions are profound, but argues that even they do not go far enough.
Nursing	Violence is a growing problem worldwide in the field of health care and within the nursing profession. A study comprising a survey and focus groups with nursing students, and interviews with nurse educators was conducted to examine nursing students' perceptions and experiences of violence at a nursing education institution in the Western Cape, South Africa. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all nursing students. Two hundred and twenty three (n = 223) respondents completed the questionnaire. Focus groups were conducted with purposively sampled student participants and semi-structured interviews with nurse educators. The findings indicated that the nature of the violent incidents experienced by students on campus, especially in the residences, ranged from verbal abuse to violation of students' property and personal space, and could be attributed primarily to substance abuse. Violence among student nurses could negatively affect learning. In a profession in which nurses are exposed to violence in the workplace, it is important that violence in the learning environment is actively prevented and respect of individual rights, tolerance and co-operation are promoted.

Sociology	The purpose of the paper was to use new longitudinal data to investigate the impact of marital status on suicide, and test Durkheim's marital status propositions. Previous research found marital status was associated with suicide, but some studies neglected sex, most of the research was cross-sectional, and divorce and separated statuses were often combined. Data were obtained from the latest release of the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS), consisting of the largest U.S. sample of suicide victims, 2,013 out of 1.5 million persons. Proportional hazards and logistic regression models were fitted to the NLMS data based on follow-up from 1990 to 2011. Results showed that when combined, the divorced and separated were over 88% more likely to suicide than the married (ARR = 1.886, CI = 1.649, 2.156). When split, the divorced had suicide risk that was over 97% higher than that of the married (ARR = 1.973, CI = 1.711, 2.274). Separated individuals experienced suicide risk that was nearly 52% greater than that of the married (ARR = 1.515, CI = 1.130, 2.037). The Mountain and southern census divisions had higher suicide risks than New England. Discussion focused mainly on Durkheim's theory of suicide.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: Sickness insurance and workers? compensation systems decide on peoples? eligibility for benefits, and are commonly based on medical certificates and assessments of work ability. Systems differ in the extent to which they preserve clients? dignity and right to fair assessments. In this article, we define a new concept for studying interactions between individuals and systems: social insurance literacy, which concerns how well people understand the different procedures and regulations in social insurance systems, and how well systems communicate with clients in order to help them understand the system. Methods: The concept was defined through a scoping literature review of related concepts, a conceptual re-analysis in relation to the social insurance field, and a following workshop. Results: Five related concepts were reviewed for definitions and operationalizations: health literacy, financial/economic literacy, legal capability/ability, social security literacy, and insurance literacy. Conclusions: Social insurance literacy is defined as the extent to which individuals can obtain, understand and act on information in a social insurance system, related to the comprehensibility of the information provided by the system. This definition is rooted in theories from sociology, social medicine and public health. In the next step, a measure for the concept will be developed based on this review.
Ethics	"With changes in clinical research practice, the importance of a study-subject""s privacy and the confidentiality of their personal data is growing. However, the body of research is fragmented, and a synthesis of work in this area is lacking. Accordingly, an integrative review was performed, guided by Whittemore and Knafl""s work. Data from PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL searches from January 2012 to February 2017 were analyzed via the constant comparison method. From 16 empirical and theoretical studies, six topical aspects were identified: the evolving nature of health data in clinical research, sharing of health data, the challenges of anonymizing data, collaboration among stakeholders, the complexity of regulation, and ethics-related tension between social benefits and privacy. Study subjects"" privacy is an increasingly important ethics principle for clinical research, and privacy protection is rendered even more challenging by changing research practice."
Management	This study adopts two theoretical perspectives, Social Cognitive Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior, to examine a model of network marketing business participation by Chinese immigrants in Australia. A structural equations modeling analysis showed that the social environment within a network marketing organization positively influences the self-efficacy of Chinese network marketers and their desire to seek opportunities. These factors positively influence the actions undertaken by network marketers, and subsequently, impact positively on their performance outcome.
Business	"Applying Terror Management Theory, this research attempts to investigate how the terror of death perception affects consumers"" sustainability attitudes under the contingent condition of religiosity. This field study was conducted in Malang, Indonesia. The findings disclose that both mortality salience and self-esteem increase materialism. Materialism is found to intensify consumers"" sustainability attitudes of green concern and consumer social responsibility (CnSR). It is also found that religiosity strengthens the effect of mortality salience on materialism and that of materialism on CnSR. Contrarily, religiosity weakens the effects of materialism on green concern. However, there is no statistical support for the moderating effect of religiosity on the linkage between self-esteem and materialism."
Cultural Studies	This introduction to this special section on race considers the case for the thesis advanced by Ash Amin in his article 'The Remainders of Race' that the conjuncture of vernacular and biopolitical racism has resulted in an upsurge in racism. It draws from three responses to that article by Abdou-Maliq Simone, Denise Ferreira da Silva and Ali Rattansi to problematize explanations for racism which appeal to ideas of human sorting instincts and other universalisms. It examines efforts to combat racism through multiculturalism and non-racial policies implemented in different parts of the world. The role of biopolitics and of neoliberalism in inflecting such policies is highlighted. Lessons are drawn for the analysis of racism from Foucault's critique of political economy and the functioning of the discourse of 'race war' in legitimizing the power relations sustaining systematic inequality in society. The implications for a new politics of the commons are then drawn out.
Environmental Studies	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is understand these perceptions and identify main problems associated to climate change in order to design effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to guarantee the sustainability of tourism and natural resources. The Mediterranean basin is a leading international tourist destination and one that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although these effects are largely known, in-depth studies of how they and the associated risks are perceived by key tourism stakeholders have not been performed. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews were held with 31 hotels, campsites and rural lodgings in the Muga River basin in north-east Catalonia, in which both owners and managers were asked about their perceptions of climate change, effects and countermeasures. Findings - Perceptions of climate change and its effects varied according to the type of establishment and location (coast, cities or inland). Significant differences were observed for perceptions of how responsibilities for implementing mitigation and adaptation measures to counter the effects of climate change, including water shortages, should be shared out between the main agents with an interest in guaranteeing the sustainability of tourism, namely, government bodies, tourist establishments and clients. The predominant opinion, however, was that the bulk of the responsibility should lie with government bodies. Practical implications - Only when those responsible for running tourist establishments are aware of the risks of climate change, it will be possible to design and implement effective short-, medium- and long-term strategies aimed at strengthening the resilience of the tourist industry. Originality/value - The originality of this study lies in its novel methodology and approach, which involved analyzing perceptions of climate change, including water shortages and its effects among owners and managers of different types of tourist accommodation establishments in distinct parts of the same area.
Communication	"This article extends the notion of a ""big data divide"" to describe the asymmetric relationship between those who collect, store, and mine large quantities of data, and those whom data collection targets. It argues that this key distinction highlights differential access to ways of thinking about and using data that potentially exacerbate power imbalances in the digital era. Drawing on original survey and interview findings about public attitudes toward collection and use of personal information, it maintains that the inability to anticipate the potential uses of such data is a defining attribute of data-mining processes, and thus of the forms of sorting and targeting that result from them."
Public Administration	This article illuminates and discusses how three contemporary Norwegian White papers and the OECD document Improving School Leadership: Policy and Practice narrate the relationship between school leadership and student learning outcomes. First, the article describes the identified dominant policy narrative connecting pupils' learning outcomes to school leadership, before the narrative techniques used to make this connection are explored in more detail. The analysis shows how a dominant public narrative describes the relationship between school leadership and pupils' learning outcomes as a hierarchical one-way chain of influence, and not as a dialogical and dynamic relationship where the elements are interdependent and influence each other. The one-way, hierarchical chain of influence constructed by the narrative plot meets the need policy has to reduce complexity in order to express governmental goals and distribute responsibility. The linearity and causality embedded in the policy narrative produces an understanding of the relationship between school leadership and learning outcomes that also signals a narrow range of options available to school leaders and teachers. By proposing a limited range of teacher- and leader practices as significant for the fulfilment of the policy goals, the narrative plot also constructs a relatively narrow frame for the professional work of school leaders and teachers.
Education & Educational Research	"The Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) has become one of the most influential forces in global education. The growing influence has been accompanied by growing criticism. For nearly two decades since the first round of PISA was conducted in 2000, the global assessment program has been roundly scrutinized and criticized by education researchers all over the world. But the mounting criticism seems to have had little impact on PISA""s influence as evidenced by its growing power in global education policy and practice. The lack of impact of criticism does not mean the criticism is not valid or PISA has improved. It simply means that the criticism has been largely ignored. The lack of impact is no reason to give up exposing PISA as a flawed business that has great power to misguide education. The expanding influence of the PISA enterprise makes it more even more important to be critical of this juggernaut today. It is also important to consider more effective and more straightforward approaches to present the criticism. The purpose of this article is to present a summary of criticisms that reveal the most fundamental flaws of PISA in non-technical language in one place. Specifically, the article focuses on criticisms of PISA""s three fundamental deficiencies: its underlying view of education, its implementation, and its interpretation and impact on education globally."
Business	Purpose - This study aims to examine the effects of contractual fairness and power sources on the relationship between the buyer and supplier on the innovation performance of the supplier. The mediating role of social capital accumulation between fairness, power and innovation performance was empirically explored. Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses were developed to investigate the relationships between supply chain fairness, power sources, social capital and innovation performance. Using structural equation modeling, the hypotheses were tested on data of 209 responses collected from supplying firms in South Korea. Findings - This study finds that supply chain contractual fairness and referent power use contribute to the innovation performance of the supplier through social capital accumulation between the buyer and supplier. Coercive power, in contrast, impedes the performance improvement of the supplier. Originality/value - This study provides supply chain practitioners, academics and policy-makers with guidance on how to facilitate and enhance innovation capabilities and performance across the supply chain. By applying social capital theory, this study also provides theoretical underpinning of the literature on supply chain fairness, power and innovation.
Public Administration	Transparency is nowadays at the top of the agenda for most governments. The number of countries that have adopted a law on access to administrative documents is on the rise. Access to information laws do not provide a substitute for transparency, but they may signal the willingness of a government to increase openness. So far, most studies have focused on states where such laws exist, especially in Europe and North America, while very little research has been conducted in Africa. This contribution is intended to capitalise on previous research to present the case of Benin. Research questions focus on the development of access to information, barriers to an introduction of a stronger law in that country and the administration's expectations regarding transparency. Data are based on interviews with civil society organisations, an official in charge of access to administrative documents in Benin and several employees of the national administration. Findings show how contextual and institutional differences shape transparency reforms, the importance of the issue of global awareness and access, and how current practices influence the approach towards access to administrative documents in Benin. Points for practitioners The case of Benin shows how openness can be fostered by the media, members of the parliament and civil society organisations. The combined action of these diverse stakeholders, also supported by regional and international partners, can lead to increased administrative transparency. This article highlights the commitment of public sector employees to create a more open administration, although they are still facing central implementation issues, such as undertrained staff, lack of resources or the dissemination and understanding of information among the population.
Information Science & Library Science	This study investigates the trend of global concentration in scientific research and technological innovation around the world. It accepts papers and patents as appropriate data for revealing the development and status of science and technology respectively. The performance of these outputs in production and citation impact is taken into consideration in the analysis. The findings suggest that both papers and patents are geographically concentrated on a small number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and France. China has made great progress in paper production and citation impact, and Taiwan and Korea have experienced a rapid growth in patents over the past years. The degree of concentration dramatically decreases when the data from the United States are excluded, indicating the effects of the U.S.'s participation on the concentration. Patents show a higher degree of concentration than papers. With time-varying aspects taken into consideration, the study indicates that the degree of concentration of papers and patents has gradually decreased over time. The concentration of patents has declined more slowly than that of papers. This decrease of the concentration is mainly due to the reduction of the predominant role of the U.S. in world R&D output.

Political Science	In this article, we examine the relationship between racial resentment and a host of political attitudes, predispositions, and behaviors across 28 years and 7 presidential elections. We find, contrary to the suggestions of recent work of the role of race in the Obama era, that the racialization of seemingly nonracial political issues began many years before the debut of Barack Obama and extends beyond his presidency. More specifically, we find, controlling for other factors, that the relationships between racial resentment and partisan and ideological self-identifications, evaluations of the major party presidential candidates, and attitudes about health insurance and governmental services have strengthened each subsequent year beginning in 1988 through 2016. This trend reflects the growing extent to which racial considerations are brought to bear on individual evaluations of and orientations toward the political world.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objective: To examine the wellbeing of families of male mine-workers living in remote mining towns in Australia. Methods: Through an extensive review of available (but limited) social science literature on mining towns this paper explores and identifies the key social issues and problems of mining towns. Social science and health-related research are used to argue that there are several factors that may negatively affect the relationship and psychological wellbeing of family members. Results: Atypical work schedules of the mining jobs could negatively affect the long-term health of the workers, and could constrain their qualitative participation in domestic roles. Limited availability of resources, services and flexi-time jobs in mining towns marginalise female partners to domestic chores. Higher level of alcohol consumption by workers and their preferred spending of leisure time with workmates symbolise patriarchal culture in mining towns that further marginalises women and could strain marital relationships. These factors could affect the social and emotional health of the children. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary studies are needed to gain realistic understanding of the dynamics of long-term impacts of long work hours/compressed work weeks, socio-cultural, motivational and environmental factors on the wellbeing of the workers and their families living in mining towns. Family counsellors and mental health professionals working in remote mining towns must take into consideration the likely negative impacts of work and community on individuals and families.
Nursing	"Learning about how to develop and lead the implementation of evidence based practice (EBP) in services is an important part of the education of developers and managers for the social and health care sectors. In order to develop this teaching and to support the development of EBP in services, a Teaching Development Effort (TDE) was conducted by establishing academic service partnerships (ASPs) and connecting Master""s students"" assignments with them. The TDE was conducted as a part of a larger project whose main aims were to strengthen, develop and renew transfers of knowledge and competence between higher education institutions and workplaces, and to strive for a more multidisciplinary quality in workplace innovations. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the experiences of working life representatives regarding the development of EBP in ASPs within the social and health care sectors. The data were collected by email interviews. Eight working life representatives"" participated in the study. The informants were asked to describe the usefulness of the plan that had been prepared by the students regarding the implementation of EBP, and to describe the significance of this ASP for the development of working life. A qualitative content analysis method was used when analyzing the data. Virtually all the informants stated that the plan prepared by the students, for the implementation of EBP, was entirely ready to be taken into use in the form they had finished it. The significance of the ASP was described in terms of the ASP assisting in improving the quality of the service. Furthermore, the workplace-based student assignment topics, external views to support the development of EBP, and the theoretical approach used by the students were valuable. The ASP provided opportunities for the practitioners to learn new things, inspiration to look to the future, and assistance in the implementation of time management practices. ASPs have potential to support EBP in services and the use of them is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Education, Special	This article provides an update of a previous analysis of the case law concerning manifestation determinations culminating in the revised pertinent provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004. Specifically, the update consists of a synthesis of the legislative history, Office of Special Education Programs interpretations, and published hearing and review officer and court decisions that provide legal guidance as to the application of the manifestation provisions of IDEA 2004 and its 2006 regulations. The results reveal that thus far (a) the hearing and review officer and court decisions applying the new, causality criteria have continued at a higher but still modest rate (i.e., frequency per year) as the case law under the prior criteria; (b) the conduct in question remained focused primarily on drugs and, in various forms, violence; (c) specific learning disability and other health impairment (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) continued to predominate as the disabilities at issue, but the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder became more frequent than in the prior case law; (d) the only new notable decisional factor was burden of proof; (e) the outcomes of the new case law has, with an unexpected but limited reduction, continued to predominate in favor of determinations that the child's disciplined conduct was not a manifestation of the child's disability; and (f) procedural issues have played a limited role in terms of reversing such district manifestation determinations.
Communication	The affiliation between film and music is the cornerstone of modern entertainment industry synergy. This article examines one of the key chapters in that relationship: the period in the 1950s during which the major studios entered the record business. Ostensibly designed to capitalise on the emerging film soundtrack market, the flurry of mergers, acquisitions and the establishment of new record labels coincided with the rise of rock'n'roll and the explosion of the market for recorded popular music. The studios quickly found that in order to keep their record labels afloat, they needed to establish a foothold in popular music. The processes by which they achieved this transformed the marketing of recorded music, sparking a period of unprecedented commercial success for the record industry in the late 1960s. Simultaneously, from these record subsidiaries Hollywood learned how to market cinema to a youth audience, heralding the arrival of 'New Hollywood'.
Anthropology	This paper considers the faunal remains from recent excavations at the Royal London Hospital. The remains date to the beginning of the 19th century and offer an insight into the life of the hospital's patients and practices of the attached medical school. Many of the animal remains consist of partially dissected skeletons, including the unique finds of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) and Cercopithecus monkey. The hospital diet and developments in comparative anatomy are discussed by integrating the results with documentary research. They show that zooarchaeological study of later post-medieval material can significantly enhance our understanding of the exploitation of animals in this period
Anthropology	International migration is a suitable scenario for the study of the changes and continuities of patriarchal gender relations in the perspective of those who migrate. This article aims to move towards a better understanding of the impact of border crossing for men and women from a relational interpretation of gender. Social inequality systems, at the origin and destination, are related with gender aspects when describing transitions. They change either to more democratic relations or to greater subordination in the society of destiny. The elements that explain those trends are related to micro-level social factors such as the type of couple relationship predominant before migrating, the people's social capital and other macro-level aspects such as the working and legal conditions that immigrants find in the destination environment. Broadly speaking, migration is seen, at the same time, as an opportunity to change on a small scale and a way to give continuity to traditional customs of gender between immigrants. Differences in each case are related to the accumulated impact of migration which links micro-level and structural factors.
Criminology & Penology	Scholars and layman alike have long assumed that the Nazi regime kept the German people in line by employing heavy doses of coercion involving arbitrary justice and lethal repression meted out by dreaded organizations of the Nazi criminal justice system such as the Gestapo and so-called Special Courts. Between the late 1980s and early 2000s, this view was challenged by a number of scholars who gained access to and analysed previously unavailable archival evidence and who became convinced that the Nazis did not rule primarily through coercion; rather, the Nazi regime was popular with most Germans who gave the regime their voluntary consent. Most recently, however, new proponents of the original view of Nazi support based more on coercion than consent have become popular again. This article employs an unprecedented combination of different types of empirical evidence to determine which view best characterizes the support for the Nazi movement during the Third Reich. The main types of evidence employed are quantitative analyses of thousands of archival files generated by policing and court bodies in three Rhineland cities and thousands of written questionnaires involving Jewish and non-Jewish German people who had resided in cities and smaller communities across the Third Reich.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Lying off the coast of Venezuela in a prime 'sun, sea, and sand' location, Curacao is a popular tourist destination with a complex past. Since its colonisation by the Dutch in 1634, it has seen slavery, abolition, a civil rights movement, industrialisation, and severe environmental damage. All the while it has served as an exotic escape for wealthy travellers. In 2010, a high-profile European jazz festival came to the island and drew a large, international crowd. The success of this first Curacao North Sea Jazz Festival (CNSJF) sparked a new commercial strategy by the Curacao Tourist Board to grow the industry and in recent years, more events began to spring up on the island. One of these was Punda Jazz Vibes, which is a free event run by local residents (by contrast, CNSJF tickets cost $195 per night). This paper examines the discourses that surround and connect these events, with special focus on the production and mediation of cultural heritage in the wider tourism infrastructure that supports them. We demonstrate the political nature of heritage production on Curacao and show how the festivals are implicated in a long history of colonial and postcolonial exploitation, thus questioning the social impact of the tourism industry at large.
Sociology	The present study examines the relationship between incarceration and post-prison residential mobility. In spite of recent research examining the residential context following incarceration, we know little about if or how incarceration affects individual patterns of residential mobility. This study starts to fill this gap in knowledge by drawing on nationally representative data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). I find that individuals with a history of incarceration are more likely to move after prison than they are before prison. This relationship holds even after accounting for various time-varying and time-stable sources of spuriousness, including other known correlates of mobility. Additional analyses suggest that this effect is strongest early in the reentry period, and that there exists important racial variation in the relationship between incarceration and mobility. These results imply that, while housing stability is an important feature of successful prisoner reentry, incarceration contributes to larger patterns of residential instability.

Cultural Studies	The point of departure for this article is an astonishment at the recent increase in elderly women in fashion and beauty ads, and the question of what value this kind of photography may attribute to the ageing body and face in a visual culture whose association between youth and beauty forms one of the most influential constructions of ageism in Western culture. To attempt to answer this question, the article discusses the relationship between beauty, time and the ageing face, especially in beauty and fashion ads. The 2015 spring ad campaign for the luxury fashion brand Celine, which featured celebrity writer' Joan Didion, is used as a case study to examine how time and ageing coalesce in the construction of the ageing writer as cool. This article forms part of Media and the Ageing Body' Special Issue.
Health Policy & Services	We describe pharmaceutical regulations in nineteen developed countries from 1992 to 2004 and analyze how different regulations affect pharmaceutical revenues. First, there has been a trend toward increased regulation. Second, most regulations reduce pharmaceutical revenues significantly. Third, since 1994, most countries adopting new regulations already had some regulation in place. We find that incremental regulation of this kind had a smaller impact on costs. However, introducing new regulations in a largely unregulated market, such as the United States, could greatly reduce pharmaceutical revenues. Finally, we show that the cost-reducing effects of price controls increase the longer they remain in place.

History Of Social Sciences	Contemporary interest in Asian meditation raises questions about when Westerners began investigating these practices. A synopsis of Western-originating scientific meditation research is followed by a brief introduction to mesmerism. Next, the unappreciated Ways the mesmerists explored Oriental mind powers is recounted. Flow the mesmerists' cultural positioning, philosophy, and interest in mind-body practices facilitated their inquiries of Oriental medicine and Hindu contemplative practices is explored, followed by a consideration of why these investigations were unique for the era. The Way this Work Subverted Western cultural imperialism is examined. A consideration of the historical continuities and discontinuities between the mesmerists' inquiries and twentieth-century meditation research concludes the article. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Environmental Studies	The effectiveness of a capacity market is analyzed by simulating three conditions that may cause suboptimal investment in the electricity generation: imperfect information and uncertainty; declining demand shocks resulting in load loss; and a growing share of renewable energy sources in the generation portfolio. Implementation of a capacity market can improve supply adequacy and reduce consumer costs. It mainly leads to more investment in low-cost peak generation units. If the administratively determined reserve margin is high enough, the security of supply is not significantly affected by uncertainties or demand shocks. A capacity market is found to be more effective than a strategic reserve for ensuring reliability. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Management	Relatively little attention has been paid to the study of the strategic management of process innovators and their capabilities. This paper contributes to our understanding of process innovation by analyzing responses from 4,208 SMEs which introduced only process innovation, and no product innovation. Our study was set up specifically to allow us to identify and isolate process innovation activities in SMEs. Findings reveal two distinct innovation patterns among process innovators, one characterized primarily by the acquisition of embodied knowledge and external support from suppliers, and a second centered on the development of R&D and high absorptive capacity, accompanied by organizational innovation.
Education, Special	Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) for students with disabilities can be categorized into the following categories: visual, auditory, mobile, and cognitive skills-based CAI. Cognitive-skills based CAI differs from other types of CAI largely in terms of an emphasis on instructional design features. We conducted both systematic review of literatures and meta-analysis of studies using cognitive skills-based CAI to determine the effectiveness of this technology on the learning outcomes of students with disabilities. This study also scrutinized critical instructional design features of CAI used in the synthesized studies. Results indicated (a) a moderate weighted average effect size of 0.35 for group-comparison design studies; (b) relatively large effect sizes, but inconsistent among different indices, in single-subject experimental design studies; and (c) insufficient information available on design features of the CAI used in the primary studies. Limitations, implications, and future research directions were discussed.
Substance Abuse	How do we get drug sellers to talk with us? We approach them from the standpoint that what they know, their experiences and perceptions about drug dealing as work, is a specialized knowledge and that we are asking them to share it with us despite the potential for serious personal risk. In each interview, we try to overcome difference and social distance by identifying what we call nodes of affinity - commonalities or shared experiences. As meanings are negotiated and narratives constructed, power shifts back and forth between interviewer and interviewee, shaping the give-and-take process of knowledge building. We discuss the ways in which social isolation, a defining feature of the social context of drug selling, can affect the interview process. We describe some of the strategies we have derived from the symbolic interactionist and social constructionist traditions to help engender trust and rapport with interviewees. And we describe the reciprocal presentations of self by interviewer and interviewee and the social construction of meanings and narratives in the course of the interviews. We hope this will contribute to the existing literature on the micropolitics or the relations of power that are negotiated within interview processes such that knowledge gets co-constructed.
History	The paper discusses the role of mediator assumed by the Delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yugoslavia in the solving of controversies between Italy and Yugoslavia in relation to Italian prisoners of war and deportees from the region of Venezia Giulia. The research is based mainly on unpublished (archival) sources and previous studies about Italian POWs and deportees in Yugoslavia. The paper presents so far unknown activities of the Delegation in favour of these prisoners, and some (political) context that conditioned and influenced them. Ever since the spring of 1945, the operation of the Delegation was severely compromised by activities (not) performed by the International Committee of the Red Cross to the benefit of Partisan prisoners of war and Yugoslav civilian internees during the Second World War. As a result, the Yugoslav leadership nursed a grievance against the Delegation and met its activities with much reservation. Despite the Delegation carrying out its mission correctly - i.e., inspecting camps, delivering correspondence and aid to prisoners of war and civilians - doubts were cast upon its action by all parties involved. The delegates, in fact, never visited all Italian prisoner-of-war and deportee camps, and were faulted for it by the Delegation in Italy and thereby, indirectly, by the Italian government. Eventually, the lead Committee in Geneva became suspicious, too, which prompted its decision to send one of its principal delegates, Georges Dunand, on a special mission to Yugoslavia with the delegate in Italy, Pierre Colombo, following him to Belgrade soon thereafter. Nevertheless, neither of them reached any considerably different conclusions than those arrived at by the Delegation itself. The latter properly performed its tasks and tried to conduct skilful humanitarian diplomacy as required by the circumstances. It should be noted that the hostility of the Yugoslav leadership to its activities and the political nature of the issue of Italian POWs and deportees in Yugoslavia actually prevented the Delegation from wielding a greater influence on the solution of this problem.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article discusses varieties of capitalism in Latin America and examines whether the ascension to power of governments elected with a broad popular constituency changed the course of labor policies implemented after the 1990s. More specifically, it approaches labor regulation implemented under the governments led by the Workers' Party (PT) in Brazil (2003-2013) and the Chaves government in Venezuela (1999-2013). The main goal of the research is to verify how these governments dealt with the institutional legacies of their neoliberal predecessors. The theory of varieties of capitalism and the concept of path dependency were used in order to understand this issue. It was noticed that the strength of social movements on the streets were determinant in shaping the positions adopted by the government of the PT and Chavez.
Information Science & Library Science	Nowadays opinion mining systems play a strategic role in different areas such as Marketing, Decision Support Systems or Policy Support Since the arrival of the Web 2.0, more and more textual documents containing information that express opinions or comments in different languages are available. Given the proven importance of such documents, the use of effective multilingual opinion mining systems has become of high importance to different fields. This paper presents the experiments carried out with the objective to develop a multilingual sentiment analysis system. We present initial evaluations of methods and resources performed in two international evaluation campaigns for English and for Spanish. After our participation in both competitions, additional experiments were carried out with the aim of improving the performance of both Spanish and English systems by using multilingual machine-translated data. Based on our evaluations, we show that the use of hybrid features and multilingual, machine-translated data (even from other languages) can help to better distinguish relevant features for sentiment classification and thus increase the precision of sentiment analysis systems.

Education, Special	Despite the importance of replication for building an evidence base, there has been no formal examination to date of replication research in special education. In this review, we examined the extent and nature of replication of intervention research in special education using an article progeny approach and a three-pronged definition of replication (direct, conceptual, intervention overlap). In this approach, original articles (i.e., parent studies) were selected via a stratified, random sampling procedure. Next, we examined all articles that referenced the parent articles (i.e., child studies) to determine the extent and nature of the replication of the original studies. Seventy-five percent of the parent studies were replicated by at least one child study. Across all parent studies, there were 39 replication child studies. Although there was a high overall replication rate, there were a limited number of conceptual replications, and no direct replication studies were identified.
Geography	The rapid increase in movement trajectory data causes data storage, transmission, computational processing, and visualization problems. These issues can be alleviated through trajectory simplification, which removes unnecessary details from raw trajectories. Most existing studies that focused on trajectory simplification considered freely moving objects, and they attempted to minimize position errors in their simplified representations in a two-dimensional plane. However, a large number of objects move within the constraint of road networks. In such constrained trajectory simplification, position error should be measured in the network space. Moreover, constrained trajectories contain a wealth of speed-change information that reflects the movement patterns of moving objects. In this study, we designed a data model, proposed error measurements, and developed a two-component method to simplify constrained trajectories. The geometric component in our method extended the classic Douglas-Peucker method using network distance to simplify trajectories with a guaranteed position error bound in network space. The semantic component enhanced the simplified representation by employing a data-enrichment strategy that allows users to control speed loss. Real trajectory data were used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method has a lower position error than existing algorithms do when road network constrained trajectory data are simplified. The method can also preserve original speed in the simplified representation with a relatively low increase in data size. Our study thus provides an approach to simplifying trajectory data that guarantees error bounds in both location and speed.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article analyses the role of the pharmaceutical and medical device industries ('pharma') in the construction of scientific and medical knowledge. Pharma's activities are part of the broader dispositif of institutions, enterprises, regulations and constituencies within which medical-scientific knowledge is generated, but pharma's contributions exhibit a specific character reflecting commercial pressures. As drug development proceeds, research and marketing activities coalesce around 'product canons' that integrate scientific truth-claims and commercial positioning, generating knowledge with implicit commercial functionality. From this platform, pharma stamps consensus-building 'narratives' into medical-scientific discourse, in which 'problems' arise and are 'solved' by drugs. Concurrently, pharma modulates the structure of discourse and the social networks through which discourse proceeds. Implicit within these activities is a meta-science whose goal is to understand and technologize the operation of science to an external end. This mode of knowledge production can be viewed as a normative transformation of Kuhnian normal science, characterized by the attachment (and at times subordination) of paradigmatic tenets to extrinsic goals; exaggerated control of belief, research and consensus formation; and a capacity for infringement of traditional norms of scientific truthfulness. An International Standard of Integrity in Science would strengthen pharma's contributions to medical and scientific knowledge.
Political Science	Research on clientelism often starts from a shared puzzle: How can clientelism be a viable electoral strategy if voters can renege on their commitments to politicians? The standard solution proposed is that politicians resolve this commitment problem with voters through monitoring and enforcement. But there has been startlingly little evidence of individual-level monitoring and enforcement in the recent literature, and many studies now document the use of clientelism even where politicians are aware that the commitment problem remains completely intractable. When read together, recent studies suggest that the focus on resolving the commitment problem is a red herring. Instead, it is increasingly clear that clientelism does not need to be monitored and that the commitment problem does not bind as politicians choose their electoral appeals. New puzzles, motivated by advances in the recent literature, deserve comparatively more attention in future research.
Communication	During the coverage of breaking news and broadcasts on social media, journalists and audiences alike share links, comments, and opinions in response to new developments. On Twitter, such content can gain increased visibility by receiving retweets from other users, through automated functions, or by manually republishing and modifying comments. This article studies tweeted coverage of the doping scandal involving Lance Armstrong in 2012 and 2013. Humorous framing is found to be popular in this discussion, and such comments experience different longevity to breaking news tweets. With these patterns come new opportunities for users to modify and appropriate punch lines in attempts to receive increased attention-and for the serendipitous creation of similar jokes-which raise questions of authorship and attribution.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper is focused on two main topics which influence the contemporary and on-going debate about museums (and, among others, city museums): the existence of a collection and of a building dedicated to housing it. Then it deals with the question of the size of cities selected for the establishment of a city museum (large or small centres). Finally, the use of documentary, iconographical, cartographical sources and multimedia tools for the representation of urban changes over a long period of time is considered from the point of view of the necessity to communicate with a broad range of users (for example, tourists, citizens, new immigrants, children).
Transportation	Recently, there has been a growing interest in externalities in our society, mainly in the context of climate and air quality, which are of importance when policy decisions are made. For the assessment of externalities in transport, often the output of static traffic assignment models is used in combination with so-called effect models. Due to the rapidly increasing possibilities of using dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models for large-scale transportation networks and the application of traffic measures, already several models have been developed to assess the externalities using DTA models more precisely. Different research projects have shown that there is a proven relation between the traffic dynamics and externalities, such as emissions of pollutants and traffic safety. This means that the assessment of external effects can be improved by using temporal information about flow, speed and density, which is the output of DTA models. In this paper, the modelling of traffic safety, emissions and noise in conjunction with DTA models is reviewed based on an extensive literature survey. This review shows that there are still gaps in knowledge in assessing traffic safety, much research is available concerning emissions, and although little research has been conducted concerning the assessment of noise using DTA models, the methods available can be used to assess the effects. Most research so far has focused on the use of microscopic models, while mesoscopic or macroscopic models may have a high potential for improving the assessment of these effects for larger networks.
Transportation	America West Airlines acquired the bankrupt US Airways on September 27, 2005 to form the US Airways Group, improving its competitive position in the US airline industry. This paper analyzes the post-merger performance of the US Airways Group using airline operating metrics and financial ratios for the period 2005 to 2013. While the airline has still a long way to go to improve its leverage and liquidity ratios, its capital structure and ability to pay its obligations have improved since 2005. Moreover, although the airline is still inefficient in utilizing its assets, the efficiency improvements achieved since the merger have resulted in profits and positive returns to investors. Its share prices have also largely outperformed the S&P 500 and the XAL since the merger, an indication that investors are pleased with how the merger is developing over time. In view of the US Airways Group's improving financial and operating performance, the merger is, essentially, a success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper presents an analysis of some of the socio-political stakes riding on the recent implementation of a 'structure plan' (or schema directeur) for the 'Botanique' area in Brussels. The aim is to build a bridge between the discussions about the new modes of governance and the development of participatory or deliberative democracy, on the one hand, and an empirical study of a public policy that borrows from these categories, on the other hand. The innovative practices that characterise the 'structure plan' are often labelled 'participatory'. In this text, we intend to determine to what extent they participate more in a new type of urban governance without truly helping to enhance the people's involvement.
Rehabilitation	Purpose To identify access barriers to physical rehabilitation for traffic accident (TA) victims with severe disability and build a theoretical model to provide guidance towards the improvement of these services. Methods Qualitative research carried out in the city of Natal (Northeast Brazil), with semi-structured interviews with 120 subjects (19key informer health professionals and 101 TA victims) identified in a database made available by the emergency hospital. The interviews were analyzed using Alceste software, version 4.9. Results The main barriers present in the interviews were: (1) related to services: bureaucratic administrative practises, low offer of rehabilitation services, insufficient information on rehabilitation, lack of guidelines that integrate hospital and ambulatory care and (2) related to patients: financial difficulties, functional limitations, geographic distance, little information on health, association with low education levels and disbelief in the system and in rehabilitation. Conclusion The numerous access barriers were presented in a theoretical model with causes related to organizational structure, processes of care, professionals and patients. This model must be tested by health policy-makers and managers to improve the quality of physical rehabilitation and avoid unnecessary prolongation of the suffering and disability experienced by TA survivors.
International Relations	It is often suggested that Western peacebuilding in the occupied Palestinian territory has failed because it has not delivered a viable Palestinian state. But if peacebuilding is reinterpreted as a form of counterinsurgency whose goal is to secure a population, then it has not failed - in fact, on the contrary, it has been quite successful. This article therefore critically evaluates the idea and practice of peacebuilding as counterinsurgency by exploring the symbiosis in the philosophy and methods of COIN and peacebuilding, and charts its implementation in the oPt through the realms of governance, development, and security. It argues that peacebuilding in this context operates as another layer of pacification techniques whose goal is to secure the Palestinian population and ensure acquiescence in the face of violent dispossession.
Industrial Relations & Labor	This article studies the determinants of subjective job insecurity in five European countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany, Spain and The Netherlands), using data from the WageIndicator web survey. The impact of different variables is estimated using logistic regression. The analysis shows that differences in subjective job insecurity of women are explained by their objective situation in the labour market. In contrast, subjective insecurity increases with age; education reduces job insecurity, as do wages, except at very high wage levels; having a temporary - but not - a part-time - contract contributes to insecurity, which points to the different nature of the two types of contract.
Nursing	Traditionally, written examination and clinical practice assessments are the main ways of deeming midwifery students fit and competent for practice. Contemporary academics in an effort to engage the students in the learning process have employed alternative teaching and assessment strategies. Among the alternative strategies are group projects after which members of the group are awarded the same grade, and peer assessment. With the purpose of informing the midwifery curricular, we utilised a qualitative descriptive approach to explore midwifery students' experiences and views on the use of group poster presentation for learning and assessment. The participants consisted of a purposive sample of 14 higher diploma midwifery students who were registered in a third level institution in Ireland. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted following the completion of the poster presentation assessment. Permission to undertake the study was obtained from the college ethics committee. In this paper, we focus on the participants' views of group marking and peer assessment which are among the key elements that emerged in this study. While awarding a group mark was overall accepted, peer assessment proved a more contentious issue. Most of the participants found it challenging marking their friends. Reactions to group marks were very much influenced by the group dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper challenges the historiographical discontinuity established between earlier anthropometric testing and the arrival of psychological testing with Binet and Simon's intelligence test in 1905. After some conceptual clarifications, it deals with word association: a kind of psychological experimentation and testing which became popular over the last two decades of the 19th century. First Galton's exploration are presented, followed by experiments performed at the Leipzig laboratory by Trautscholdt, and then Cattell and Bryant's collective testing. Additionally, I document the use of this method for the study of mental difference through the works of Munsterberg, Bourdon, Jastrow, Nevers and Calkins. The cases I present show how the method gave rise to various measurements and classifications. I conclude that the word association technique triggered reflection on mental uniqueness, gender traits and the influence of education, among other topics. Moreover, it prepared the terrain and anticipated some basic attractions and problems intelligence testing would later encounter.
Management	The challenge is (a) to balance both centralised control to preserve the global commons and (b) to involve people in policy making so that they feel culturally engaged and committed to the policy. Dictatorships and forms of World government from above to support the global commons are no more of an answer than forms of liberal democracy that do not engage people in between national elections. Passive voting does not help people in diverse democracies to engage in thinking through 'if then scenarios' about their social, economic and environmental future.
Public Administration	In the early 1990s, all German Lander (states) introduced direct election of executive mayors, along with the procedures to recall a sitting mayor by local referendum. This paper looks at the context and causes of this major institutional change and its impact on local politics. Although the directly-elected executive mayor has risen to a dominant position, effective institutional and political checks and balances are in place to prevent misuse of power. Finally, the German reforms are compared with other European countries.
Industrial Relations & Labor	The purpose of this article is to illuminate the views and experiences of workplace representatives in Australia in the context of falling union density, and to analyse factors that are most strongly associated with subjective union power at the workplace level, as perceived by delegates. The analysis relies on a large random survey of workplace delegates in eight significant Australian unions. The article describes the situation broadly facing delegates as shown by the survey and analyses a set of factors associated with the power of workers as perceived by delegates. We find that higher levels of reported activism among delegates are strongly associated with greater subjective union power. We also find that self-reported delegate confidence is also strongly associated with perceptions of higher union power, as is delegate's clarity about their roles. The data also show a strong association between perceptions of democracy within the union and union power. Support for delegates from the union office and organizers is also associated with higher levels of union power at the local level. The analysis provides some support for union renewal strategies associated with the 'organizing model' as applied in Australia and some other Anglo-Saxon countries that aim to increase the activism of workplace delegates through education, the provision of support for workplace delegates and more democratic union structures.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The wild bootstrap was originally developed for regression models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Over the past 30 years, it has been extended to models estimated by instrumental variables and maximum likelihood and to ones where the error terms are (perhaps multiway) clustered. Like bootstrap methods in general, the wild bootstrap is especially useful when conventional inference methods are unreliable because large-sample assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be few clusters, few treated clusters, or weak instruments. The package boottest can perform a wide variety of wild bootstrap tests, often at remarkable speed. It can also invert these tests to construct confidence sets. As a postestimation command, boottest works after linear estimation commands, including regress, cnsreg, ivregress, ivreg2, areg, and reghdfe, as well as many estimation commands based on maximum likelihood. Although it is designed to perform the wild cluster bootstrap, boottest can also perform the ordinary (nonclustered) version. Wrappers offer classical Wald, score/Lagrange multiplier, and Anderson-Rubin tests, optionally with (multiway) clustering. We review the main ideas of the wild cluster bootstrap, offer tips for use, explain why it is particularly amenable to computational optimization, state the syntax of boottest, artest, scoretest, and waldtest, and present several empirical examples.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Green hospitality presents a unique servicescape that evokes socially/environmentally desirable behaviors. Multiple instances of greenwashing mandate that consumer trust in green services be built through meaningful experiences for positive consumer hotel relationship. With limited research on trust-enthusing green experiences, this works uses a mixed-method approach and Holbrook's experiential value framework as theoretical underpinning to measure green experiential value (GEV) composed of self-oriented (utilitarian/hedonic) and other-oriented (social/altruistic) values. Only self-oriented values are found as key enablers of trust and in turn, higher green brand equity and re-patronage intentions. A positive moderation effect of pro-environmental customer attitudes signifies the importance of creating positive green experiences for such customers to enhance trust.
Family Studies	This study examines marital construction of family power among male-out-migrant couples in a Chinese village in Guangxi Province. In-depth interviews show that male-out-migrant couples prefer joint decision making. When couples are in disputes, power tends to go to the ones who shoulder greater house-hold-based responsibilities; in this case, they are mainly married women. The couples achieve power-responsibility congruence by following relation-oriented exchange, which emphasizes spouses' obligations to the family and relational harmony, as opposed to equity-oriented exchange, which stresses the importance of comparative resources in one's ability to wield power. Consequently, family power among male-out-migrant couples is group serving and enhances marital harmony. However, married women's greater family power constrains as well as empowers them precisely because of the power-responsibility congruence. The unique power processes generated from relation-oriented exchange observed in this study are attributable to ecological and institutional constraints facing the village couples.
Social Issues	The monetary value of informal eldercare in the family and voluntary sector has drawn much attention as it concerns a resource of welfare governments and nonprofit organizations try to activate via cash benefits. Studies addressing the issue in order to assess the economic impact of non-market activities and the willingness to accept financial rewards have largely ignored differences in the utility function of caregivers. Applying a behavioral-economic approach, we report a profound and formerly unobserved distinction between care in the household and non-household care for a family member or in a voluntary framework: whereas caregivers within the household perceive care as a burden and a positive shadow price arises, in the non-household context-and particularly in the volunteering case-care extends well-being and leads to negative shadow prices. The results show that non-market activities can only be measured in monetary terms to a limited extent and contribute to explaining the boundaries of monetary incentive policies.
Communication	Aggression portrayed realistically is more likely to be imitated than non-realistic aggression. However, despite its ultimate claim to reality, the portrayal of aggression in reality television programs has rarely been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and portrayal of three different types of aggression in popular reality and non-reality programs on UK television. As a whole, there was more relational aggression in reality programs than in non-reality programs. When programs were analyzed separately, some programs contained high levels of relational and verbal aggression, yet no physical aggression. Implications for television ratings are discussed.
Criminology & Penology	"This study explores the association between past-year face-to-face contact with the police and subsequent victimization reporting. It also examines whether this relationship depends on the type of encounter (citizen-initiated contacts, routine vehicle stops, invasive encounters associated with being a suspect), its perceived justness, or victim characteristics. Among victims who did not notify the police, the reasons behind this decision are assessed to understand the mechanisms through which police encounters are related to reporting. This research is the first to use longitudinal data that link the 2002, 2008, and 2011 Police Public Contact Surveys to the 2002-2014 National Crime Victimization Surveys. Multivariate logistic regression is used to examine the effect of prior contact on police notification among victims of personal (N = 1073) and household (N = 11,433) crimes. Prior contact with the police has no main effect on the reporting of personal crimes; however, the negative effects of police-initiated and unjust contact are amplified for the poor and African Americans. The reporting of household crimes varies based on prior police experiences and whether they were viewed as just. Personal crime victims with invasive contact are more likely than other contact groups to attribute non-reporting to fear of reprisal. Using national data tells a complex story about how race/ethnicity, poverty, and recent experiences with the police interact to shape victims"" behavior. The intricacies of these findings suggest that efforts to increase reporting may need to be multifaceted and address victims"" concerns about safety and justness."
Law	Patents are generally considered to be the most territorial of all the various forms of intellectual property. Even patent law, however, has confronted issues involving the application of a U.S. patent to extraterritorial activity. The Supreme Court has expressed an interest in both issues the extraterritorial application of U.S. law and patent law. At times, these interests have intersected. Notwithstanding the Court's recent elaborations on extraterritoriality, the approach by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been, at best, inconsistent. At times the court has afforded extraterritorial protection, even in the face of strong territorial language in the patent statute itself. At other times, however, it has approached the issue of extraterritoriality more restrictively, even when the statute itself expressly contemplates the regulation of activities outside of the United States. This dynamic has been addressed by myself and other scholars. More recently, however, the Federal Circuit has addressed the issue of patent damages for extraterritorial activities. These scenarios have arisen because there necessarily has been an act of domestic patent infringement. The damages theory advocated by the patent holder, however, has attempted to ensnare overseas sales, either under a lost-profits or reasonable-royalty theory. Additionally, the Federal Circuit has begun to address the appropriate scope of damages for infringement under section 271(f) of the Patent Act, a provision that defines infringement as the exportation of all the components of an invention, or a single component with no substantial noninfringing use, where it is to be assembled abroad. Necessarily, this provision contemplates the regulation of foreign markets through the domestic hook of acts of exportation. The Federal Circuit, nevertheless, rejected the patentee's requested remedy in this case. This Article turns to the issue of the extraterritorial reach of patent damages. It analyzes the Federal Circuit's recent pronouncements using the two-step method articulated by the Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community. This analysis suggests that damages for infringement under various aspects of the Patent Act can be treated differently with respect to extraterritoriality. This Article goes on to suggest that the Federal Circuit's approach lacks nuance to account for the particular economic and legal circumstances that differentiate the different infringement provisions at stake. It draws on earlier work where I advocated for a conflicts-based approach to extraterritorial application of U.S. patents, and extends that work to these scenarios, offering a more balanced approach to assessing whether damages are appropriate in these circumstances. Finally, this Article explores whether the various damages theories involved in these cases, regardless of the territorial limits, suggest it is time to revisit the foreseeability/proximate cause aspect of Rite-Hite. The theories of damages seem quite far removed from the actual acts of infringement, even if they occurred within the United States. Some scholars have begun work on this enterprise, and these cases suggest such consideration is ripe.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Research has exposed how colonial power relations operate in and through various domains of tourism. As byproducts of Western academia, tourism research and education are significant sites where the structures, systems, and narratives of Settler colonialism can become further entrenched and legitimized. What research methodologies can challenge the colonial complexion of tourism research and enable tourism students and scholars to confront how their identities and responsibilities are tethered to (Settler) colonization? We argue that collective memory work (CMW), a participatory and participant-focused methodology, can contribute to these disruptive aims by examining individual experience as embedded and imbued with social meaning. Our ultimate objective is to situate, articulate, and reflect on the use of CMW as an unsettling methodology in tourism research and education contexts. Since 2016, we have used CMW to engage Settler Canadian graduate students in a process of critically analyzing individual memories and collective experiences of tourism and Indigenous-Settler relationships. After establishing theoretical and political contexts of Settler colonialism, we present an overview of CMW's feminist and transformative underpinnings and explain how these are being adapted into the methods of our ongoing research with students. Preliminary insights from this research illuminate CMW as a consciousness-raising pedagogical methodology that, in focusing in on Settler memory narratives, helps make space for decolonization in tourism and tourism research.
Law	"Despite increasingly sophisticated antidiscrimination laws, discrimination and inequality have proved remarkably resilient. This prompts questions about the limits of law's ability to achieve social change. One way forward is to fashion new legal tools, which impose duties to promote or achieve equality, rather than focusing on individual rights against specific perpetrators. In the past decade in Britain, such fourth generation equality laws have been developed in a distinctive format, requiring the decision-maker to ""have due regard"" to equality, rather than taking action to achieve such objectives. This standard has triggered a spate of judicial review cases, particularly in response to austerity measures imposing deep budgetary cuts on disadvantaged groups. This Paper's aims are two-fold. The first is to examine the judicial approach to the due regard standard in the light of recent regulatory theory. Do courts consider the due regard standard as a signal for deference, or can it be understood as an example of ""reflexive law,"" facilitating deliberative decision-making rather than imposing external standards likely to meet with resistance from the regulated body? The Paper concludes that courts have struggled to deal with the regulatory challenges presented by the ""due regard"" standard, wavering between appropriate and inappropriate intervention. The second aim is an analysis of whether a deliberative standard is appropriate in the equality context. The record of judicial review cases demonstrates that such a standard risks legitimating or simply reconfiguring existing inequalities."
Social Issues	"Car guards form an integral part of South Africa's urban landscape. The phenomenon has its roots in the dual realities of unemployment and crime in the country, in particular vehicle-related offences. Car guarding commenced in Durban in the early 1990s when unemployed persons started looking after the vehicles of drivers in exchange for a donation, and the practice soon burgeoned across the country. Drivers are, however, not obliged to pay car guards for the services they provide since the practice of tipping often depends on internalised attitudes towards tipping and to reward good quality service. A distinction is made between formal and informal car guards, where the latter provide car guard services on public streets, mostly in inner city areas, and the former offer their services at the parking areas of shopping centres outside the central business district. Car guards are required to have undergone the necessary training and registration with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority of South Africa and some local authorities have introduced bylaws to regulate the car guarding industry. Furthermore, media reports suggest that formal car guards have to pay a daily fee to the managers/owners of shopping centres simply to offer their services to drivers. These matters prompted research into the car guard phenomenon in Pretoria and an article was published about the implications of the survey for private security policy and practice. The current contribution entails a closer analysis of the data with the aim of differentiating the experiences of immigrants from those of South Africans who work as car guards in the capital city. In the absence of a sampling framework, 144 car guards were interviewed using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Ninety were immigrants and 54 were local citizens. Owing to the sampling strategy used, and because the data did not show a normal distribution, significant differences between the two groups were identified by means of the Mann-Whitney U test for which effect sizes were calculated. Immigrants who worked as car guards were significantly younger, had higher levels of education, were more likely to be the breadwinners of their families and they had fewer children compared to their South African counterparts. They were also more likely to have been unemployed in the past and they were less likely to blame the political environment for their situation. They received compensation for their services less frequently and were significantly more often subjected to verbal abuse by clients. Interestingly, immigrants who work as car guards were less likely to consider their work as important in preventing crime and they presented significantly lower levels of knowledge of labour laws and municipal bylaws regarding the car guard industry. Despite these significant differences, immigrants who work as car guards were equally subjected to financial exploitation by having to pay a daily fee for the parking areas where they worked. The exploitation even extended to some car guards having to pay for the identifying clothing they wore every day. Roughly a third of the car guards' monthly income was paid to the owners or managers of shopping centres, and sometimes car guards could not secure sufficient funds to pay for the daily fee to ""rent"" parking bays. Most of the car guards reported that they were merely surviving from day to day, and the industry was providing extremely limited prospects of promotion. In fact, many car guards did not have a written contract securing their employment, thus exacerbating their vulnerability and potential for exploitation in the informal economy. In addition, the undocumented status of immigrants who worked as car guards made it difficult for them to complete the necessary training and to register officially with the regulatory authority. While having left their countries of origin owing to political and economic turmoil, illegal immigrants who end up working as car guards might well unknowingly be fleeing to exploitation in South Africa."
Linguistics	The present study joins the long-running debate about the semantic-pragmatic distinction of the three domains of epistemic modality, evidentiality, and factuality. In particular, this work aims at providing both a theoretical and operational framework to investigate what type of speech act is at stake when a speaker/writer alternatively decides to mark a proposition as an epistemic modal, an evidential, or a factual construction. In fact, three basic types of illocutionary force will be shown to determine the modal marking of a constative speech act: evaluational (EvF(p)), presentative (PrF(p)), and assertive (AsF(p)) force. This classification is based on a set of tests that can effectively address either grammaticalized constructions or pragmatic strategies, independent from the specificity of the item under enquiry. This approach is first used to disentangle the controversial meaning of MUST-type predicates and then further theorized as a speech-act based framework of epistemic disambiguation.
Management	In this paper, we seek to extend existing understandings of how sensegiving is associated with conflict and power games. We look specifically at sensegiving by managers that promotes strategies and actions geared toward preserving their positions against change. Formulating a conceptual framework about sensegiving and power games in organizations may help to address a meaningful gap in the sensemaking/sensegiving literature. Although organizational members are continuously engaged in sensegiving for advocating certain strategies of action, a neglected issue is that members, and in particular managers, may look at sensegiving as a strategy to guard against change. In multinational companies (MNCs), for instance, boundary conditions - cultural and geographical differences - may draw attention to the nature of control and conflict between headquarters and subsidiaries and subsequently militate against substantial change. This assertion underlies our primary research question: Why and through what types of power games do managers of MNCs give sense to issues and events that help to maintain organizational inertia and legitimate behaviors and actions that curtail organizational change?
Transportation	Crane sequencing in container terminals determines the order of ship discharging and loading jobs that quay cranes (QCs) perform, so that the duration of a vessel's stay is minimized. The ship's load profile, berthing time, number of available bays, and QCs are considered. More important, clearance and yard congestion constraints need to be included, which, respectively, ensure that a minimum distance between adjacent QCs is observed and yard storage blocks are not overly accessed at any point in time. In sequencing for a single ship, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed, and a heuristic approach based on the model is developed that produces good solutions. The model is then reformulated as a generalized set covering problem and solved exactly by branch and price (B&P). For multiship sequencing, the yard congestion constraints are relaxed in the spirit of Lagrangian relaxation, so that the problem decomposes by vessel into smaller subproblems solved by B&P. An efficient primal heuristic is also designed. Computational experiments reveal that large-scale problems can be solved in a reasonable computational time.
Communication	This paper examines the growing cultural trend of Chinese online fiction. Using Gans's twin concepts of taste culture and taste public, it looks at online fiction as a product of two taste cultures evident on the Chinese Web. The paper then explores the growing appeal of online fiction for consumers and producers (or readers and authors) in relation to two key issues: are there important differences between online fiction and print fiction? Is the participatory nature of online fiction leading to a reinvigoration of literary creativity in the Chinese-speaking world? The relationship between the consumer and the producer of Chinese online fiction can also be explored in terms of an attention economy, and the evolving market for this type of fiction provides an excellent example of how such an economy functions. The attention economy encourages competition for the attention of readers and consequently ensures that the values of the taste public consuming this fiction strongly dictate its content and its continued improvement as a form of literary production.
Education, Special	This study focused on literacy-related barriers to understanding the rights of students with disabilities and their parents within the special education system. SMOG readability scores were determined for procedural safeguards documents issued by all state departments of education. The average reading grade level was 16; 6% scored in the high school range, 55% scored in the college range, and 39% scored in the graduate or professional range. Comparisons of national literacy data and national data on the educational attainment of parents of students with disabilities suggest that there is a disproportionate burden of limited literacy among these parents compared to the general population. The significance of results is discussed with respect to relevant regulatory requirements, case law, and evidence from the legal and health literacy fields.
International Relations	How does the new government of President Benigno S. Aquino III perceive national security challenges, and how will the government respond to them? This paper examines several primary documents and gives an account of the security environment prevailing in the Philippines. It also gives an overview of the national security policy framework that the Aquino administration uses in responding to security challenges. This paper also contributes to existing theoretical debates on the nexus between human security and national security through its analysis of the development of human security and national security thought in the Philippines. It points out that empirical evidence shows that national security is not state-centric, but rather human-centric in conception, and that this approach has been institutionalized over time. The main findings are: 1) The Philippines is beset by various global, regional, and domestic challenges; 2) these challenges are traditional and non-traditional in nature and thus taken up comprehensively by the Philippines; and 3) the Philippines uses a human security approach to its national security concerns. This approach has been accepted by the armed and defense services as the means by which they will also implement their mandates. Such an approach is only a fulfillment of the Philippines' own constitutional provision which identifies the people as the source of sovereignty. The human security approach, however, needs to be further institutionalized through implementation and effective policy frameworks.
Social Work	About 700,000 cases of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect are substantiated each year, making childhood maltreatment a common form of trauma in the histories of adults. We summarize the literature on the consequences of child maltreatment across the lifespan, agreeing with those researchers who see maltreatment as a public health problem. We examine low-income women's perceptions of the impacts of childhood abuse on their adult experiences through 19 life narratives collected during 2008. Using a theoretical lens of Hobfoll's Conservation of Resources, we discuss themes of loss and developmental stress in women's experiences of childhood maltreatment. We conclude with implications for professionals and case managers working with low-income women, suggesting that assessment for childhood maltreatment is an important aspect of supporting low-income women and their families on the road to self sufficiency.
Demography	The determinants and consequences of the naturalization of immigrants is a hot topic in the political debate in Europe. This article compares the effect of naturalization on the income attainment of immigrants in two Scandinavian countries, Denmark and Sweden, using longitudinal register data from 1986 and onward. Sweden is characterized by low obstacles to naturalization, and existing studies provide inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of naturalization on labor market outcomes. Denmark is instead characterized by higher barriers to naturalization, as well as a virtual inexistence of previous studies on the topic. Results, obtained through individual fixed-effect regression analysis, suggest similar effects in both countries. A consistent naturalization premium is detected for immigrants of Asian and African descent, but not for any other immigrant group. The similarity across contexts arguably questions the use of more stringent naturalization laws to promote the economic integration of immigrants.
Anthropology	Zooarchaeologists have long recognized that the number of identified specimens (NISP) is dependent on the degree to which bones are fragmented, but attempts are rarely made to control for the effects of fragmentation on NISP. This paper provides insight into those effects by presenting both a formal model of the relationship between NISP and fragmentation and experimental data on that relationship. The experimental data have practical implications regarding the effectiveness of potential measures of bone fragmentation, suggesting that specimen size-which can be determined easily through digital image analysis-is more useful than other variables that have been or might be used as fragmentation measures.
Education, Special	This study investigated the effects of cognitive strategy instruction on the mathematical problem solving of three adolescents with spina bifida. Conditions of the multiple-baseline across-individuals design included baseline, two levels of treatment, posttesting, and maintenance. Treatment 1 focused on one-step math problems, and Treatment 2 focused on two-step problems. All students substantially improved as measured by performance on criterion tests of math problem solving. Discussion centers on the need for intervention studies with students with spina bifida that specifically address their unique characteristics and the adaptations and accommodations that benefit these students.
Law	The high levels of poverty, inequality and socio-economic marginalisation that bedevilled Kenya for generations led to a struggle for a new constitutional dispensation, which culminated in the promulgation of a new, egalitarian and transformative constitution in August 2010. This constitution entrenched justiciable socio-economic rights within an elaborate Bill of Rights. Though an important step in the process of the egalitarian transformation of the country, the challenge remains to transform these precepts into practice with their scrupulous implementation through legislative, policy and programmatic frameworks, as well as judicial decision-making. This article argues that, in order to achieve the intended egalitarian transformation, Kenya must adopt a strong interpretive approach, with sufficient foundational standards for the translation of these rights into tangible realities for Kenyans. Kenya must therefore explicitly adopt a minimum core approach for the realisation of these rights to transform them into practical realities for the poor, vulnerable and marginalised Kenyans.
Anthropology	In the pre-colonial period, and in most parts of Southern Africa throughout the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century, marriage, the family and the homestead were embedded in economic, political and religious institutions. The household was the hub of social life, and its layout symbolically expressed the relationships between men, women, cattle and the ancestors. Economically, bridewealth paid in cattle linked the pastoral economy of men and the garden economy of women. Politically, marriages established, sustained and restructured allegiances. The paper concludes with some reflections on the transformations that this traditional structure has undergone in the course of the twentieth century.
Management	Effectuation provides an explanation of the behaviour of entrepreneurial firms in transforming environments. This article empirically investigates the influence of effectuation on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance, while considering environmental uncertainty as a moderating influence. A survey is administered to a sample of high-technology firms and hypotheses are tested using correlational and regression analysis. A positive relationship between effectuation and the firm's level of EO is established, where this effectuation moderates the relationship between EO and firm performance. However, the interaction effect between effectuation and environmental dynamism and hostility proves to be non-significant. By applying an empirical lens this study increases the relevance and generalisability of effectuation theory by expanding it from mostly a descriptive nature to a theory that accounts for moderators in the EO-performance relationship.
Information Science & Library Science	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how students construct narratives of themselves as information seekers in a school context where their descriptions of their information activities are assessed and graded. Design/methodology/approach - Blog posts on credibility judgements written by 28 students at a Swedish upper secondary school were analysed through a bottom-up coding process based in the sociocultural concept of narratives of selves. Findings - Two tensions in the students' accounts are identified. The first tension is that between the description of the individual, independent student and the description of the good group member. The second tension is between describing oneself as an independent information seeker and at the same time as someone who seeks information in ways that are sanctioned within the school setting. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on a specific social practice and on situated activities, but also illustrates some aspects of information activities that pertain to educational contexts in general. It explores how social norms related to credibility judgements are expressed and negotiated in discursive interaction. Practical implications - The study highlights that when information activities become objects of assessment, careful consideration of what aspects are meant to be assessed is necessary. Originality/value - The study is based on the idea of information activities as socially and discursively shaped, and it illustrates some of the consequences when information activities become objects of teaching, learning, and grading.
Environmental Studies	"Within many practical, professional and political fields, resilience has become a normative, barely questioned orientation principle, yet it has not been the subject of explicit reflection. The following considerations aim to contribute to closing this gap without assuming a dichotomy between the functional and the normative levels. Resilience is understood as a process whose focus is the response to upheaval and problems. The ability to respond, then, is the starting point from which the normative aspects of resilience can be more clearly brought out and connected to conceptual differences (simple and reflective resilience; specific and general resilience) within resilience discourse. This is grounded in Bernhard Waldenfels' idea of responsive ethics. Our concept seeks to provide greater understanding of the term ""responsible resilience"" and bring up the normativity of resilience in a reflective, non-dichotomous way."
Transportation	This study advances understanding of the role of residential location in joint household travel and activities for non-work purposes in an Asian city context. This has been done by investigating the relationship between job accessibility, and the undertaking and duration of joint travel and activities of multi-person households in Hong Kong. Particular attention was given to the difference between new town and urban-area commuters who experienced marked different levels of job accessibility as a result of their residential locations. Drawing on the 2011 household travel survey, a suite of multivariable analysis was carried out. The findings highlight that: (1) longer working hours were associated with a lower probability of joint household travel and activities for new town and urban-area commuters alike; (2) longer commute and working hours significantly reduced the time window for joint household activities; (3) and job accessibility played a more important role in affecting the opportunities for discretionary joint household activities among new town commuters than urban-area commuters. The implications of these findings can be used to inform policymaking to increase the opportunities and time window for joint household travel and activities among new town commuters. Potential avenues for future research are also identified.
Industrial Relations & Labor	"The union voting intention literature shows that many nonunion employees who indicate that they think unions are instrumental in increasing wages, benefits, and working conditions would vote against forming a union. Although American workers have often been characterized as pragmatic with regard to their support for unions, the ""disconnect"" between union beliefs and union voting intentions just described suggests that more subtle forces are at work. In this paper, it is shown empirically that union instrumentality is a limited predictor of union voting intentions for a recent national cross-section of workers. Rather, more general feelings toward unions and employers are primary. These accounted for a large portion of the variance in union voting intentions, with general feelings towards unions by far the most critical predictor. A concluding section discusses whether the results may reflect changes in union power and changes in employee views of unions. Areas for future research are discussed."
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Citizen engagement is a key component of democracy, especially in local governments. It is seen as a way to generate input and support, and to find creative solutions to problems and challenges governments face. Currently, Western democracies are witnessing a challenge in which citizens have less trust in their government. This explorative study examines if citizen engagement is a valuable strategy based on citizen panels of three Dutch municipalities. Four different direct forms of citizen engagement are studied: (1) attending a council meeting, (2) an information meeting, (3) conversation with an official, and (4) other forms of citizen engagement (e.g. social media or letter). The regression results indicate that the different forms of direct citizen engagement seem not to contribute to the amount of trust citizen panel members have in their own municipality. Attending a council meeting, a conversation with an official and other forms of engagement seem to have no or a negative effect on trust. In addition, the number of times that citizens engage seems not to or even negatively contributes to the amount of trust that they have in their municipality.

Business	This position paper developed the argument that creating innovative and forward-thinking conceptual approaches to consumer education is a proactive process, the trademark of consumer activism. Assuming that (re) conceptualizing consumer education is a form of consumer activism, this article identified the conceptual contributions and intellectual innovations of 24 consumer education initiatives in North America (19622012). Using an historical analysis method, this study profiled consumer educators who tried to stay ahead of the curve by creating leading-edge approaches to socializing people into their consumer role. In effect, they were expressing their personal and intellectual convictions about the potential and possibilities of consumer education as a means to promote change to protect and empower people in their consumer-citizen role.
Social Issues	Towards a sensational populism in the community press? This article examines recent changes made to the front-page of the 104 year old Potchefstroom Herald (the Herald) as these represented a significant break from the conservative typography and news agendas of the past. The Herald has seemingly shifted towards a tabloid style or sensational journalism (which includes strong typography and an emphasis on the dramatic and emotional). In order to contextualise the Herald's changes and ascertain whether the said more sensational style has become a general trend amongst South Africa's community newspapers, a umber of leading community newspapers are also briefly examined. This is done against the backdrop of the success achieved by daily and Sunday tabloids, for example the Daily Sun and Son. The question is posed whether the once conservative community press is headed in the same direction. A qualitative analysis is made of the size and prominence of headings and photographs, the news agenda and other front-page style elements of the Herald and other community newspapers, such as the populist Vaal Weekly, Vaalweekblad and Western Sun; the semi-populist Polokwane Observer and Northern Review; the more traditional papers with some populist elements, such as the Lowvelder, Tygerburger, Eikestadnuus, Paarl Post and Worcester Standard; and the more traditional Sandton Chronicle and Roodepoort Record. Based on this analysis, it is concluded that the 2010 Herald was quite unique with regard to its tabloid-style, stacked headlines punting stories of crime, accidents and the bizarre. As the sensational populist style of the Herald's front-page was not continued on the inside pages, the newspaper had a dualistic character The newspaper could, therefore, not be described as a true tabloid. However, it is argued that the Herald made a fundamental shift away from a more sober approach to community journalism. (Subsequently, the Herald has reverted back to a more eclectic approach, which utilises all the recent styles.) While the Herald has gradually shifted to a sensational populism, its circulation figures grew markedly - from just above 7 000 in 2007 to 9 000 in 2010. However, the editor denies that the editorial changes were due to managerial pressure. He also emphasises that the newspaper was sensitive to readers' preferences. Although the study shows that a number of other community newspapers had become populist to some extent, most newspapers did not follow the Herald's combination of typography and populist news agenda in 2010. It was notable, though, that many of the leading community newspapers incorporated populist elements on their front-pages. It is argued that while commercial and other pressures are real, community newspapers should carefully distinguish between blatant sensationalism on the one hand and lively populism on the other Should they ignore this distinction, they run the risk of losing their traditional readers. Furthermore, questions could be raised regarding the tabloidisation of the community press, as it could put the newspapers' trustworthiness at risk.
Health Policy & Services	Background: Since 2003, Afghanistan's largely unregulated for-profit private health sector has grown at a rapid pace. In 2008, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) launched a long-term stewardship initiative to oversee and regulate private providers and align the sector with national health goals. Aim: We examine the progress the MoPH has made towards more effective stewardship, consider the challenges and assess the early impacts on for-profit performance. Methods: We reviewed publicly available documents, publications and the grey literature to analyse the development, adoption and implementation of strategies, policies and regulations. We carried out a series of key informant/participant interviews, organizational capacity assessments and analyses of hospital standards checklists. Using a literature review of health systems strengthening, we proposed an Afghan-specific definition of six key stewardship functions to assess progress towards MoPH stewardship objectives. Results: The MoPH and its partners have achieved positive results in strengthening its private sector stewardship functions especially in generating actionable intelligence and establishing strategic policy directions, administrative structures and a legal and regulatory framework. Progress has also been made on improving accountability and transparency, building partnerships and applying minimum required standards to private hospitals. Procedural and operational issues still need resolution and the MoPH is establishing mechanisms for resolving them. Conclusions: The MoPH stewardship initiative is notable for its achievements to date under challenging circumstances. Its success is due to the focus on developing a solid policy framework and building institutions and systems aimed at ensuring higher quality private services, and a rational long-term and sustainable role for the private sector. Although the MoPH stewardship initiative is still at an early stage, the evidence suggests that enhanced stewardship functions in the MoPH are leading to a more efficient and effective for-profit private sector. These successful early efforts offer high-leverage potential to rapidly scale up going forward.
Environmental Studies	The growth in community involvement in public domain decisions for rural spaces in England over the past 20 years has increased the overall costs of such decision-making. These transaction's costs can be grouped into four types pertaining to organisations, institutions, belief systems and knowledge and information (K&I). Within the last of these, costs can arise because of a lack of K&I, the costs of procuring K&I and K&I overload. In an empirical survey in Gloucestershire county in the south west region of England K&I transaction's costs were found to be increasing, particularly in relation to procurement and overload. The number of planning and policy documents as a subset of K&I had increased considerably in the case study area such that for the rural district of the Cotswolds 60 plans pertained simultaneously in 2007. Despite this, many of those involved in decision-making about rural spaces felt the costs involved in assimilating the information that they contained were worth paying if it allowed them to be better informed.

History Of Social Sciences	Several scholars, including Pierre-Yves Saunier and Renaud Payre, have studied how the members of the various networks of the 'urban internationale' attempted to overcome professional and political cleavages throughout the twentieth century. In contrast, only a few scholars have scrutinized the ways in which international professional institutions sought to prevail over interlingual difficulties. Although various institutions restricted communication to English, French, and German, many members had only a limited command of foreign languages; additionally, amateur interpreters further impeded multilingual conversation. Resulting language difficulties worsened professional and political conflicts within the urban internationale. Charting the attempts of the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning (IFHTP) to establish an international notation of town plans and an interlingual glossary for urban planning, this essay studies attempts of the urban internationale to facilitate communication across borders during the interwar era. Through the example of the IFHTP, this article studies how planners within this international network organized transborder expert cooperation. It focuses on the debates surrounding the creation of a notation system and a glossary, designed to facilitate communication between planners from Western industrial societies while largely excluding connections to the Colonies and other parts of the world.
Economics	It is well-known that price- and quantity-based regulation approaches provide different investment incentives. But usually, only the effect on the level of investment is studied. In this paper, we show that under uncertainty, they also lead to the adoption of different technologies due to the disparate risks that a regulated firm is exposed to. Different regulatory instruments induce different technologies and this effect cannot be compensated by varying the design of the instruments. Furthermore, price-based instruments lead to the adoption of a socially suboptimal technology, so that the inclusion of technology choice provides a bias in favor of a quantity-based regulation compared with Weitzman's (Weitzman, M.L., 1974. Prices vs. quantities. Review of Economic Studies 41; 477-491) criterion. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Information Science & Library Science	In this study we examined who tweeted academic articles that had at least one Finnish author or co-author affiliation and that had high altmetric counts on Twitter. In this investigation of national level altmetrics we chose the most tweeted scientific articles from four broad areas of science (Agricultural, Engineering and Technological Sciences; Medical and Health Sciences; Natural Sciences; Social Sciences and Humanities). By utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, we studied the data using research techniques such as keyword categorization, co-word analysis and content analysis of user profile descriptions. Our results show that contrary to a random sample of Twitter users, users who tweet academic articles describe themselves more factually and by emphasizing their occupational expertise rather than personal interests. The more field-specific the articles were, the more research-related descriptions dominated in Twitter profile descriptions. We also found that scientific articles were tweeted to promote ideological views especially in instances where the article represented a topic that divides general opinion.
Transportation	This study investigates the disparities in access to various types of opportunities in ethnic neighborhoods, as compared to wealthy white neighborhoods (the reference). Focusing on the heterogeneity within ethnic neighborhoods, I distinguish between different types of neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic makeup and median household income. The Los Angeles region provides an interesting empirical setting because of its racial diversity and its auto-centric spatial structure. The results show that the various types of ethnic neighborhoods differ not only in spatial patterns within the region but also in terms of relative access to opportunities. Nevertheless, I find that all types of the low-income ethnic neighborhoods have higher levels of access to jobs and non-work opportunities, except for access to parks/open spaces, than do the reference neighborhoods. This holds true regardless of accessibility measures and travel modes. However, the relative access to opportunities for middle-to-high-income ethnic neighborhoods varies by accessibility measure. Considering that each accessibility measure has its own set of meanings and planning implications, diverse measures should be taken into account for policy interventions. The present study also adds further evidence of modal disparities, which are much greater than spatial disparities, in access to opportunities.
Substance Abuse	AIMS - To examine what happens to patients who have been involuntarily discharged from medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with methadone or buprenorphine in Malmo, Sweden. MATERIAL AND METHOD - A total of 35 people, with a long history of heroin addiction, were interviewed, including ten women. Most interviewees were recruited among visitors with discharge experiences at the local needle exchange programme. The article focuses on these informants' experiences and interpretations of being discharged. RESULTS - Discharge had little legitimacy and was perceived as unfair. Several of the interviewees went back to heroin abuse while others tried to create their own maintenance programmes by buying methadone or buprenorphine on the black market. Many resorted to crime or prostitution to make ends meet. CONCLUSIONS - According to National Board of Health and Welfare regulations, discharge and a three-month exclusion from all MAT is an appropriate response to violation of rules. Exclusion nevertheless led to harsh consequences. The interviewees' living conditions were consistently impaired, as were their physical and mental health and contacts with family members, since they soon returned to a lifestyle and drug abuse similar to that before treatment.
Management	Although the literature on product recalls is informative, our understanding of these events is still in its infancy. To promote and guide future research in this nascent area, we engaged in a two-step process that included a systematic review and categorization of product recall-related literature and interviews with executives from along the entire supply chain. By oscillating between findings in the literature and themes that emerged during our interactions with executives, we discovered several research opportunities that have yet to be systematically examined by scholars. We also highlight four underutilized theories in supply chain management researchupper echelons theory, punctuated equilibrium theory, enactment theory, and justice theorythat could help guide future research in this area. For managers, this study reveals insights related to four key aspects of product recalls: (1) recall precursors (factors that may lead to recalls); (2) the recall process; (3) the impact of recalls; and (4) mitigation approaches (mechanisms firms can employ to reduce the impact of recalls). For scholars, our study identifies several emergent research opportunities and theoretical lenses in the same four areas and thus serves as a road map for future product recall research.
Gerontology	Objectives To explore the combined effects of aging and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cognitive decay. Design Cross-sectional, single-cohort study. Setting Institute of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy. Participants One hundred fifty-three asymptomatic HIV-positive (HIV+) outpatients (20% aged >= 60) and an age- and education-matched control population of 39 HIV-negative individuals. Measurements A neuropsychological investigation was conducted to compare four groups of participants classified on the basis of HIV serostatus and age (< 60 vs >= 60). The effects of age and HIV infection on neuropsychological performance were analyzed using a two-by-two factorial analysis of variance. Demographic and clinical variables associated with neuropsychological performance were identified using linear regression analysis in the HIV+ population. Results HIV infection and aging had significant negative effects on cognitive performance, but no significant interaction was observed between these two factors. Although older HIV+ participants had worse cognitive performance, they showed no distinct cognitive pattern from younger HIV+ participants. Moreover, younger HIV+ participants' performance on memory tasks was qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with that of older HIV- participants, despite the dramatic age difference. Conclusion Aging and HIV might be additive factors in the expression of cognitive decline. As the HIV+ population ages, routine neuropsychological examinations could help clinicians better understand and manage the expression of cognitive impairment. J Am Geriatr Soc 60: 2048-2055, 2012.
Sociology	A wide-held assumption is that increased religiousness is associated with stronger perceptions of a conflict between religion and science. This article examines this assumption using four distinct questions asked on the third wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). Results indicate a variety of viewpoints for constructing the relationship between science and religion, rather than a simple conflict-compatibility continuum. Further, findings suggest that increased religiousness among emerging adults is associated with a stronger agreement in science and religion's compatibility, rather than conflict. Incorporating New Age or non-Western spiritual tradition and a strict adherence to fundamentalist Christian doctrine are associated with complex configurations of beliefs on the relationship between religion and science. Collectively, the findings among emerging adults contradict traditional assumptions about how religious experiences influence beliefs, suggesting that such social factors may influence beliefs and attitudes uniquely at different points in the lifecourse or across generations. More broadly, the findings speak to the ongoing debate about the extent to which differing social experiences may produce consistent or discordant sets of beliefs and values, and in turn how particular configurations may impact strategies of action across a range of life domains.
International Relations	Secrecy, especially state secrecy, has taken on increasing interest for scholars of international relations and security studies. However, even with interest in secrecy on the rise, there has been little explicit attention paid to exposure. The breaking of secrecy has generally been relegated to the role of a mere 'switch', whose internal workings and variations are of little consequence. This article argues that exposure is a significant process in its own right, and introduces a new conceptualization of exposure as a socially and politically constructed process, one that must be 'thickly described' if we are to understand how it occurs and has effects. I differentiate the process of exposure into two distinct aspects, reserving the concept of exposure to refer to releases of information, while introducing the concept of revelation to refer to a collective recognition that something has been exposed. The first part of the article explores existing understandings of secrecy and exposure to demonstrate why a new framework is needed, while the second part applies this framework to a case study of the exposure of the use of torture in the post-9/11 US 'war on terror'.
Demography	BACKGROUND Despite evidence that divorce has become more prevalent among weaker socioeconomic groups, knowledge about the stratification aspects of divorce in Israel is lacking. Moreover, although scholarly debate recognizes the importance of stratificational positions with respect to divorce, less attention has been given to the interactions between them. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to examine the relationship between social inequality and divorce, focusing on how household income, education, employment stability, relative earnings, and the intersection between them affect the risk of divorce in Israel. METHOD The data is derived from combined census files for 1995-2008, annual administrative employment records from the National Insurance Institute and the Tax Authority, and data from the Civil Registry of Divorce. We used a series of discrete-time event-history analysis models for marital dissolution. RESULTS Couples in lower socioeconomic positions had a higher risk of divorce in Israel. Higher education in general, and homogamy in terms of higher education (both spouses have degrees) in particular, decreased the risk of divorce. The wife's relative earnings had a differential effect on the likelihood of divorce, depending on household income: a wife who outearned her husband increased the log odds of divorce more in the upper tertiles than in the lower tertile. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that divorce indeed has a stratified pattern and that weaker socioeconomic groups experience the highest levels of divorce. Gender inequality within couples intersects with the household's economic and educational resources.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In this article, we describe the command xtpurt, which implements the heteroskedasticity-robust panel unit-root tests suggested in Herwartz and Siedenburg (2008, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 53: 137-150), Demetrescu and Hanck (2012a, Economics Letters 117: 10-13), and, recently, Herwartz, Maxand, and Walle (2017, Center for European, Governance and Economic Development Research Discussion Papers 314). While the former two tests are robust to time-varying volatility when the data contain only an intercept, the latter test is unique because it is asymptotically pivotal for trending heteroskedastic panels. Moreover, xtpurt incorporates lag-order selection, prewhitening, and detrending procedures to account for serial correlation and trending data.
Ethics	Environmentally focussed scepticism of democracy is often founded on distrust in the public to choose outcomes consistent with green imperatives. The spectre of the Anthropocene, with large scale and complex environmental impacts, increases the stakes. It not only renders the task of governance more difficult in a technical sense, relating to the ability to deliver outcomes; it also renders more problematic the task of mobilising citizen support for appropriate action that serves their best long-term interests. The call to suspend certain democratic processes to deal with the environmental crisis is intuitively appealing, but doomed to failure. While eco-authoritarianism is a blunt instrument that assumes too much on the part of eco-elites, liberal paternalism is sophisticated and empirically robust, yet assumes too little on the part of citizens as well as being parasitic on the same kind of manipulatory political processes that have contributed to poor environmental outcomes in the first place. If the response to the Anthropocene is to reflect the nature of the challenge, then I argue that governance should involve the active support of citizens who are attuned to both the urgency and complexity of the task. Such an environmental citizen is possible when we take into account the democratic context in which judgements are made and deliberative capacities formed. But this can only be achieved if democracies develop as a whole in a more deliberative direction. In the short term, where environmental concern is easily crowded-out in political debate, deliberation helps to make salient less tangible and complex dimensions associated with the issue. Over the longer term, the effect is to transform the polity as a whole, improving deliberative capacity. The possibilities for achieving these benefits of deliberation in practice, such as enhancing existing deliberative systems, are considered.
Linguistics	This paper considers the reflexivity of language and its value to linguistic analysis. The focus is on the metalinguistic concept of 'repetition' and on how repetition is implemented as an integral part of the communication process by participants engaged in written online communication. The conditions that govern repetition in episodes of communication are explored, and analytically relevant aspects for the processes of situated sign-making are identified. With an example from a longitudinal (retrospective) study of a Danish online forum it is shown how the continuity of such processes may be analysed, based on the digital traces of reflexive episodes left by participants over a period of 5 years (2009-2014). Everyday metalinguistic practices are not generally placed high on the linguistic research agenda, and linguists tend to be more concerned about the fact that linguistics itself ultimately depends on the reflexivity of language. However, it is argued that the reflexivity of language does not logically invalidate linguistics. On the contrary, it holds the solution to situated linguistic analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethnic Studies	The predicament faced by Muslims today, either in the United Kingdom specifically or in the West more generally, is often compared with the predicament faced by Jews at some point in the past. Muslims, it is suggested, are the new Jews. Klug's article homes in on one element in this view, the claim that Islamophobia is the new antisemitism, and considers the analogy between them. An introductory section sketches the political context, after which Klug focuses on logical or conceptual issues. The two middle sections contain the core of the analysis: consideration of the two terms 'antisemitism' and 'Islamophobia' in relation to the concepts they denote, followed by an examination of the concepts as such. Certain conclusions are drawn about both their general logic and their specific logics. The final section returns to the political context and, via critique of a thesis put forward by Matti Bunzl, discusses the uses of the analogy. Klug argues that the question we need to ask is not 'Are Islamophobia and antisemitism analogous?' but 'What is the analogy worth?' The value of the analogy lies in the light it sheds on the social and political realities that confront us in the here and now. Does it illuminate more than it obscures? These things are a matter of judgement. Klug leans towards asserting an analogy between antisemitism in the past and Islamophobia in the present, within limits.
Transportation	This paper considers the coordination between quay cranes and yard cranes in a transshipment process at a container terminal. An optimization model (a linear-integer program) is developed to minimize the number of cranes used in both the quay and yard sides. In addition, the developed model determines the optimal schedule for unloading a vessel and storing its transshipment containers in the yard as a function of the container location in ship bay, type of container (e. g., weight class, size, and next port of destination), and the yard sub-block allocated for every container. The model is solved using the GUROBI solver via AMPL compiler. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the application of the model and draw insights. Our main insight is that, under coordination between the quay and yard sides, constraints on one side may significantly affect the allocation and scheduling of cranes on the other side.
Ethnic Studies	This paper analyses the marital dissolution of binational couples (i.e. couples comprised of immigrants and natives) in countries with traditionally distinct integration models: Canada, the United States and France. Previous studies appeal to cultural differences to explain the higher divorce rates of binational couples but they omit the potential effect of migration or that of environmental factors such as immigration policies and attitudes towards migration and intermarriage. In order to test a model that includes all these factors, an identical online survey was conducted in the cited countries. The concepts binational couples' and culture' were disentangled into specific types of couples and variables. While being involved in a binational marriage was not found to be a significant predictor of divorce, being involved in one where both partners are foreign born decreases the risk of divorce. Religion, family values and families' perception of a relationship are also significantly related to marital stability.
Communication	Logo, a U.S. network that launched in 2005 as an explicitly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) channel, has been implementing a rebranding strategy that it labels gaystreaming. Drawing from Logo's internal documents and interviews with Logo staff, I situate the development, discourses, and effects of gaystreaming against LGBT content elsewhere, shifts towardmultiplatform programming, and LGBT mainstreaming. Alongside industrial changes in media production, the goal of attracting heterosexual women, imagined to share particular affinities with gay men, has been the key to driving Logo toward taste-and style-based reality programming. Although Logo's Web sites currently offer broader content than the channel, overall gaystreaming has remarginalized queer subjects whom Logo's earlier programming partially addressed, comprising a homonormativity predicated on discourses of consumerism, progress, and integration.
Business, Finance	Financial sustainability in local government remains a pressing problem which has seen a host of public policy interventions, including compulsory consolidation and performance monitoring through financial sustainability ratios. In September 2014, the New South Wales (NSW) Government announced a reform program centred on increasing scale in local government to make councils 'fit for the future'. We apply factor analysis to the financial ratios informing the NSW Government's reform initiative to identify the underlying factors for observed financial performance data. We find evidence indicating that three independent underlying factors account for the adopted measures of financial sustainability. The public policy implication arising from this study suggests that the reforms imposed by the NSW Government on NSW municipalities may only meet with limited success.
Development Studies	This study examines the effect of dividend policy on shareholder value of listed companies in Ghana. It analyses the factors affecting dividend policy and how dividend policy affects shareholders' value. Data from 2009 to 2014 financial reports of listed companies on the Ghana Stock Exchange were used. The data was analysed using pooled OLS panel regression. The findings reveal that ROE, firm age, tax, tangibility, GDP growth and interest rate are statistically significant in explaining dividend policy. The study suggests that firms consider the use of dividend yield as an appropriate measure when making choices in dividend policy. The study finds a positive relationship between dividend per share and shareholders' value. More so, firms with higher dividend yield tend to reduce shareholders' value, as confirmed by a negative and significant relationship between dividend yield and shareholders' value. It concludes that dividend policy has a strong relationship with shareholders' value. The study recommends that managers should embark on prudent investment activities that would generate higher returns (both dividend and capital gains) to shareholders in order to increase shareholder value.
International Relations	Standard works on international environmental governance assume single-issue regimes with binding obligations designed to govern the behaviour of states. Yet many of the most pressing global environmental problems, including climate change, forest degradation and biodiversity loss, are governed by an array of mechanismslegal, non-legal, governmental and non-governmentalin complex arrangements. Examining the combined effects of these international and transnational efforts on domestic or firm policies and practicesthe usual targets of such effortsrequires expanding a focus on regime compliance and effectiveness to influence factors from beyond state borders. To facilitate such a move, the authors develop a framework that distinguishes four distinct pathways through which actors and institutions influence domestic policies: international rules; international norms and discourse; creation of, or interventions in, markets; and direct access to domestic policy processes. Propositions are then developed on the conditions under which, and processes through which, actors and institutions affect domestic and firm policies and practices along each pathway. The framework is applied to the case of forest governance, a prototypical example of complex global environmental governance.
Education, Special	Students with emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD) continue to have poor transition outcomes despite the continued advancement of evidence-based transition planning practices. Strategies tailored to the specific needs of students with EBD must be researched and disseminated to practitioners. A social capital approach to transition planning for students with EBD is one way to target this population. Social capital, or the power of relationships and networks to provide resources and support, has been linked to improved academic, employment, and independent living outcomes. This article (a) defines social capital as it relates to relationships, networks, and social skills, (b) presents steps for a social capital approach to transition, and (c) discusses a graphic organizer to assist students and transition teams to track social capital over time.
Environmental Studies	Perlwitz etal (2009) used computer model suites to contend that the 2008 North American cooling was naturally induced as a result of the continent's sensitivity to widespread cooling of the tropical (La Nina) and northeastern Pacific sea surface temperatures. But they concluded from their models that warming is likely to resume in coming years and that climate is unlikely to embark upon a prolonged period of cooling. We here show how their models fail to recognize the multidecadal behavior of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Basin, which determines the frequency of El Ninos and La Ninas and suggests that the cooling will likely continue for several decades. We show how this will be reinforced with multidecadal shift in the Atlantic.
Gerontology	Objectives To determine whether providing physical therapy (PT) services in the emergency department (ED) improves outcomes for older adults who fall. Design We used Medicare claims data to examine differences in recurrent fall-related ED revisit rates of older adults who presented to the ED for a ground-level fall and whether they received PT services in the ED. Our logistic regression model controlled for age, sex, Medicaid eligibility, acute injury, and certain known chronic comorbidities associated with risk of falling. Setting We analyzed national 2012-13 Medicare claims data for individuals aged 65 and older. Participants This was a claims-based analysis. We defined an index visit as any ED claim that included an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification E-Code indicating a ground-level fall. Visits resulting in admission were excluded, as were claims associated with an individual who died during follow-up; 17,975 of the 560,277 claims for eligible outpatient index visits included revenue center codes for PT services. Measurements We calculated the proportion of index visits associated with a fall-related ED revisit within 30 and 60 days and assessed differences in these proportions between individuals who did and did not receive PT services in the ED. Results Receiving PT services in the ED during an index visit for a ground-level fall was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of a fall-related ED revisit within 30 days (odds ratio (OR)=0.655, p<.001) and 60 days (OR=0.684, p<.001). Conclusion Expanding PT services in the ED may reduce future fall-related ED use of older adults. Additional analyses could assess characteristics of individuals receiving PT in the ED and follow-up PT use after discharge. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2205-2212, 2018.
Business, Finance	"Prior work has found high levels of concentration in top academic accounting journals relative to finance, management, and marketing. Moreover, concentration has been increasing in accounting while concentration in other disciplines has been decreasing or remaining about the same. We investigate whether recent efforts by the American Accounting Association, among others, have altered these trends. We examine concentration trends in top accounting journals from 1990 to 2014 and compare these trends with those in other major business school disciplines. Ratios of publications to faculty are lowest for accounting across all years, suggesting that accounting has relatively fewer ""slots"" available for top journal publications than other disciplines. In addition, our results suggest that concentration has decreased in accounting journals in recent years but that concentration has also decreased in other business disciplines. Thus, accounting has retained its position as a discipline where publications in top journals seem more difficult to attain relative to other business disciplines."
Cultural Studies	This article introduces the special section on the contribution of Jack Goody, which focuses on The Theft of History (2006). Goody attacks the notion of a radical division between Europe and Asia, which has become built into the commonsense academic wisdom and categorical apparatus of the social sciences and humanities. Eurocentrism is a constant target as he scrutinizes and finds wanting the claims of the West to have invented modern science, cultural renaissances, the free city, capitalism, democracy, love and secularism. Goody's approach favours a dynamic long-term basis for comparisons between societies and focuses on the exchange of information and goods across Eurasia to argue that the comparative advantage one society gains has been only temporary, swinging between different parts of Eurasia a number of times over the millennia. Goody suggests that China developed an active mercantile urban culture before Europe. Cities and towns with their mixture of luxury and learning, should not be seen as inevitably sub ordinate to centralized power structures in both eastern and western Eurasia. Goody criticizes the theoretical assumptions and the handling of evidence of Perry Anderson, Fernand Braudel, Norbert Elias, Moses Finlay, David Landes, Karl Marx, Joseph Needham, Immanuel Wallerstein and Max Weber. His concern is that the master categories of world history, such as antiquity, feudalism and capitalism, have been developed against a background of the particular European trajectory, then projected onto the world at large. Goody remains sceptical, not just about eurocentrism, but also the additional danger of being eurocentric about ethnocentricity, which he regards as a trap that postcolonialism and postmodernism frequently fall into.
Public Administration	This paper considers the political geography of localism and reviews the insights of geographers regarding localism and locality. It identifies three main approaches to locality in Human Geography. Regional geographers, humanistic geographers and spatial scientists view localities as relatively natural phenomena. Marxist and political-economic geographers view localities as social phenomena produced by uneven capitalist development. Post-structuralist geographers view localities as characteristically open, plural and dynamic. The paper also distinguishes three sets of political localism to be found in human-geographical literatures. First, localism describes seemingly natural ways of life - organised to maximise authentic experiences of place in the case of Humanistic Geography and to minimise the friction of distance in the case of spatial science. Second, localism describes cultural-political expressions of spatial divisions of labour, including local political cultures, local proactivity in the context of large-scale economic restructuring, and actually existing, variegated, local neoliberalisations. Third, localism describes struggles to produce locally scaled action, including projects of local autonomy and self-sufficiency directed against the central state, movements to defend collective consumption from developers, coalitions to defend fixed capital against devaluation, and state downscaling to regulate capitalism. To illustrate their usefulness, some of these insights are applied to the localism agendas of recent British governments.
Anthropology	Various explanations have been formulated regarding high levels of craniofacial variation among Native American populations but the contribution of developmental processes to the establishment of these patterns of variation remains unknown. In this study, we compare facial morphology in ontogenetic series of three Native South American populations, one hunter-gatherer group and two farmer groups, in order to test the null hypothesis that indicates that the pattern of facial differentiation between populations does not change during ontogeny. If diet-related factors contribute to outline facial morphology, it is likely to find greater differences between hunter-gatherer and both farmer groups than between two groups of farmers and this differentiation is expected to increase with age, especially in those structures that are influenced by the mechanical load of mastication. According to our results, hunter-gatherers clearly differ from the two groups of farmers. Non-heritable factors linked to diet, such as nutritional content of food, may increase differentiation across ontogeny in some cases. However, as hunter-gatherers were clearly separated from farmer populations during entire postnatal ontogeny, an important proportion of size variation may not necessarily reflect eco-sensitive changes. Consequently, the hypothesis cannot be completely rejected.
Education & Educational Research	Since the Dakar Framework for Action, governments around the world, especially in Western societies, have reaffirmed their commitment to a quality education for all in an inclusive environment. The purpose of this paper is to understand the barriers that prevent an education system from guaranteeing an inclusive education for all and for children with learning difficulties and disabilities, in particular. It is based upon the assumption that bringing about the shift envisioned within the UN CRPD requires societal changes in attitudes, beliefs and assumptions about disability, diversity and difference. It is suggested that societal values form the bedrock of an education system. In order to bring about the changes envisioned by the UN CRPD, it is necessary to reflect upon these values and their impact on educational discourse, policy and practice. This paper examines whether a correlation exists between the values underlying a society and its approach to inclusive education for children with learning difficulties and disabilities. Put another way, assessing the influence of societal values on the design of an education system, and on its approach to special education, may clarify the barriers to, and changes required for, the implementation of an inclusive education system.
Social Work	The Disabled Children and Young Peoples Participation Project (DCYPPP) was established by Barnardos (Northern Ireland) in 2002 to explore ways of involving children and young people with disabilities in decision-making processes within Children's Services Planning of the Health and Social Services Board. Over 200 young people have participated in its 10 similar to years of existence. This article describes how the DCYPPP practice has evolved in support of the young people and the factors that contribute to its successes. Policy-makers and professionals at all levels need to recognise the valuable contribution children and young people with disabilities can make and actively seek their engagement.
Health Policy & Services	Many European governments have abundantly cut down public expenditure on health during the financial crisis. Consequences of the financial downturn on health outcomes have begun to emerge. This recession has led to an increase in poor health status, raising rates of anxiety and depression among the economically vulnerable. In addition, the incidence of some communicable diseases along with the rate of suicide has increased significantly. The recession has also driven structural reforms, and affected the priority given to public policies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how austerity impacts health in Europe and better understand the response of European health systems to the financial crisis. The current economic climate, while challenging, presents an opportunity for reforming and restructuring health promotion actions. More innovative approaches to health should be developed by health professionals and by those responsible for health management. In addition, scientists and experts in public health should promote evidence-based approaches to economic and public health recovery by analyzing the present economic downturn and previous crisis. However, it is governance and leadership that will mostly determine how well health systems are prepared to face the crisis and find ways to mitigate its effects. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Health Policy & Services	Context: Current intensive care unit performance measures include in-hospital mortality after intensive care unit admission. This measure does not account for deaths occurring after transfer to another hospital or soon after discharge and therefore, may be biased. Objective: Determine how transfer rates to other acute care hospitals and early post-discharge mortality rates impact hospital performance assessments using an in-hospital mortality model. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were retrospectively collected on 10,502 eligible intensive care unit patients across 35 California hospitals between 2001 and 2004. Measures: We calculated the rates of acute care hospital transfers and early post-discharge mortality (30-day overall mortality-30-day in-hospital mortality) for each hospital. We assessed hospital performance with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) using the Mortality Probability Model III. Using regression models, we explored the relationship between in-hospital SMRs and the rates of hospital transfers or early post-discharge mortality. We explored the same relationship using a 30-day SMR. Results: In multivariable models, for each 1% increase in patients transferred to another acute care hospital, there was an in-hospital SMR reduction of -0.021 (-0.040-0.001). Additionally, a 1% increase in early post-discharge mortality was associated with an in-hospital SMR reduction of -0.049 (-0.142-0.045). Assessing hospital performance based upon 30-day mortality end point resulted in SMRs closer to 1.0 for hospitals at high and low ends of in-hospital mortality performance. Conclusions: Variations in transfer rates and potentially discharge timing appear to bias in-hospital SMR calculations. A 30-day mortality model is a potential alternative that may limit this bias.
Business, Finance	The cost of trading in securities markets is often estimated on the basis of 1. the number of shares executed rather than the number of shares in the original order; and 2. the quote midpoint at the time of trade execution rather than at the time of order submission. In our paper, we obtain data from a U.S. brokerage firm to examine the severity of these two problems. We find that the quote midpoint and order size at submission differ from that at execution approximately 40% of the time. These differences are economically important and are more likely to occur when the market is less liquid Our results highlight the need for caution when inferring trading costs from market center data sources.
Communication	Recently, video games have been advertised to broader audiences including women. If advertising can be seen as a cultural barometer, examining these changing advertising campaigns becomes a valuable way of understanding larger issues of gender and video games. In this article, I analyze several magazine advertising campaigns for Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii in women's special interest magazines. Ultimately, I illustrate how productivity through self-help becomes a major factor in advertising play toward women.
Education & Educational Research	The last 5 years have witnessed growing support amongst government institutions and educational foundations for applying continuous improvement research (CIR) in school settings. CIR responds to the challenge of implementing effective educational innovations at scale by working with practitioners in local contexts to understand what works, for whom, and under what conditions. CIR works to achieve system improvement through the use of plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, which are multiple tests of small changes. This comparative case study of two urban school districts examined how innovation design teams took up PDSA in their work to improve high school student outcomes, and their perceptions of PDSA as an approach to innovation development, adaptation, and implementation. Findings revealed both possibilities and challenges for implementing PDSA. Nearly all participants reported the value in PDSA, and participants pointed to connections to previous experiences and PDSA training as helping to build capacity. However, we found mixed levels of enthusiasm for actually conducting PDSA cycles, and capacity constraints regarding time and data collection.
Political Science	Survey researchers avoid using large multi-item scales to measure latent traits due to both the financial costs and the risk of driving up nonresponse rates. Typically, investigators select a subset of available scale items rather than asking the full battery. Reduced batteries, however, can sharply reduce measurement precision and introduce bias. In this article, we present computerized adaptive testing (CAT) as a method for minimizing the number of questions each respondent must answer while preserving measurement accuracy and precision. CAT algorithms respond to individuals' previous answers to select subsequent questions that most efficiently reveal respondents' positions on a latent dimension. We introduce the basic stages of a CAT algorithm and present the details for one approach to item selection appropriate for public opinion research. We then demonstrate the advantages of CAT via simulation and empirically comparing dynamic and static measures of political knowledge.
Business, Finance	In a large sample of shareholder initiated class action lawsuits from 1996 to 2011, we find a significant increase in informed insider option exercises during the class action period compared to the preceding quarter, and we find that this change is positively related to the probability of litigation. The market reaction to the announcement of lawsuits is negatively related to abnormal informed option exercises, but positively related to suits that ultimately get dismissed. These results suggest that the market can at least partially anticipate the merits and severity of the class action suit. In subsequent analyses, we find that CEO turnover is positively related to litigation, but not option exercises. Collectively, our results indicate that insiders knowingly trade on their private information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Environmental Studies	Schemes to promote sustainable forest management have increasingly focused on addressing widespread informalities in timber production, based on the presumed links between formalisation, the maintenance of forest cover and local welfare. This trend is typified by the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative and associated Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPA) aimed at eradicating the trade of illegal wood between partner countries and the EU. Yet there is concern that such initiatives might have detrimental impacts on the largely informal rights of local resource users. In order to inform the formalisation agenda, more detailed analysis of the operation of local rights, and how they might be affected by particular schemes is required. This paper focuses on Ghana as a country with a largely informal wood sector that has signed a VPA with the EU for the express purpose of rapid formalisation. Our analysis is guided by a framework for assessing which types of rights might be transformed by particular approaches to formalisation and the subsequent effect this might have on forests and people in particular local contexts. We then apply this framework to an in-depth local case study of on-farm timber governance within a cocoa-forest landscape in Ghana's Central Region to examine how the operation of formal and informal and substantive and procedural rights shape who controls, and benefits from, on-farm timber production. We then analyse the content of the VPA in light of these local realities and assess its potential impacts. Our findings highlight how the substantive rights the state grants to companies are presumed to be balanced with the granting of procedural rights to farmers via the mechanisms of right of refusal to harvest on-farm timber, compensation for damage to cocoa crops and the negotiation of community-level Social Responsibility Agreements with private companies. Yet a comparison of these formal rights with farmers' existing informal rights reveals that farmers' control and access to benefits from trees on their farms are notably higher in the 'illegal' chainsaw dominated informal sector than in the 'legal' state-based system. Farmers choose to maintain trees on farms both to shade cocoa and in anticipation of benefits from their informal sale. The VPA, however, aims to eradicate all informal on-farm timber production and thus threatens existing local rights and benefit capture while diminishing incentives to maintain trees on farm. Rather than further criminalising local systems of timber governance, the maintenance of tree cover and local benefit-sharing would be better served by 1) phasing out timber concessions on farmland, 2) abandoning the distinction between planted and native trees on farms and, 3) understanding, recognizing and respecting the existing informal rights of farmers, traditional authorities and chainsaw loggers to negotiate among themselves patterns of access and control of on-farm trees and timber. In general, the case study challenges the assertion that formalisation is requisite for sustainable forest management and mandates a more nuanced and contextually informed assessment of the assumed costs and benefits associated with particular forms of legal and policy reform.
Health Policy & Services	ObjectiveTo examine the effects of distance to dentists and dentist supply on dental services use among children with Medicaid coverage in Iowa. Data SourceIowa Medicaid claims for enrolled children between 2000 and 2009. Study DesignThe study sample included 41,554 children (providing 158,942 child-year observations) who were born in Iowa between 2000 and 2006 and enrolled from birth in the Iowa Medicaid program. Children were followed through 2009. We used logistic regression to simultaneously examine the effects of distance (miles to nearest dentist) and county-level dentist supply on a broad range of dental services controlling for key confounders. Additional models only used within-child variation over time to remove unobservable time-invariant confounders. Principal FindingsDistance was related to lower utilization of comprehensive dental exams (2 percent lower odds per 1 mile increase in distance), an effect that also held in models using within-child variation only. Dentist supply was positively related to comprehensive exams and other preventive services and negatively related to major dental treatments; however, these associations became smaller and insignificant when examining within-child changes except for other preventive services. ConclusionsLonger distance to dentists is a barrier for use of comprehensive dental exams, conditional on dentist supply.
Family Studies	Although most Americans agree that postsecondary education is the clearest path to later financial security, many families have trouble saving money to help their children in this process. This article focuses on the struggles of middle-income families as they attempt to negotiate their daily financial realities with their aspirations for their children's postsecondary education. In particular, the article examines the discord between the high educational aspirations these middle-income families have for their children and their daily financial constraints. We do so by analyzing in-depth interviews with 31 middle-income families living in the greater Philadelphia area. The middle-income parents in our sample are acutely aware of the importance of college for their children's upward mobility, and they ideally would like to support their children in this pursuit. However, their current financial insecurity, their lack of government support, and the rising costs of college make preparing for this dream increasingly difficult.
Education & Educational Research	Focusing on children's play, the present article explores how 3- to 6-year-old children (re)produce, (re)negotiate and challenge heteronormativity in a Swedish Early Childhood Education setting. The article is based on ethnographic data, focusing on (re)production of heteronormativity in a particular kind of idealized, often feminine-coded and peer-group play with a low degree of teacher participation, labelled Mum, Dad, Child play' by the children. Our results show that children's play is structured by certain themes, such as family and home, and certain gendered and/or age-coded positions, such as mother, father, child or baby. Age difference (child/adult) proves to be the cornerstone of the heteronormative family metaphor of the play, where the child/baby position is central. To describe the intersections of age, gender and sexuality in our analysis, we suggest the use of the concept of age-coded heteronormativity.
Education & Educational Research	Background: Research training is essential to the development of well-rounded physicians. Although many pediatric residency programs require residents to complete a research project, it is often challenging to integrate research training into educational programs. Objective: We aimed to develop an innovative research program for pediatric residents, called the Scholarly Activity Guidance and Evaluation (SAGE) program. Methods: We developed a competency-based program which establishes benchmarks for pediatric residents, while providing ongoing academic mentorship. Results: Feedback from residents and their research supervisors about the SAGE program has been positive. Preliminary evaluation data have shown that all final-year residents have met or exceeded program expectations. Conclusions: By providing residents with this supportive environment, we hope to influence their academic career paths, increase their research productivity, promote evidence-based practice, and ultimately, positively impact health outcomes.
Ethics	Should physicians have the right to conscientiously object to assisted reproduction? The extent of the healthcare worker's right to conscientious objection has recently been debated in Norway. This article asks whether physicians should have a right to conscientious objection to the performance of, and referral for, assisted reproduction, and discusses arguments for and against the same, utilizing a framework of seven criteria for the evaluation of conscientious objection. The fundamental dilemma of conscientious objection is how two important considerations can be reconciled: the patient's right to treatment, and the protection of the healthcare worker's moral integrity. It is argued that physicians should have the right to object to performing, assisting with, and referring for assisted reproduction generally when the objection is grounded in the moral value of the embryo. Furthermore, physicians may also have a moral right to object to performing, assisting with, and referring for assisted reproduction for same-sex couples, but only on conditions that are further specified.
Family Studies	This study examines long-term effects of parental divorce on sibling relationships in adulthood and the role of predivorce parental conflict. It used large-scale retrospective data from the Netherlands that contain reports from both siblings of the sibling dyad. Results show limited effects of parental divorce on sibling contact and relationship quality in adulthood but strong effects on sibling conflict. The greater conflict among siblings from divorced families is explained by the greater parental conflict in these families. Parental conflict is a far more important predictor than parental divorce per se. Siblings from high-conflict families have less contact, lower relationship quality, and more conflict than do siblings from low-conflict families. Finally, when it comes to sibling relationship quality, the effect of parental divorce depends on the amount of parental conflict. Parental divorce has little effect on the quality of the relationship in low-conflict families, but it improves the relationship in high-conflict families.
Nursing	This article presents findings of a study which assessed the nutritional knowledge levels of nursing students as nurses are in a better position to serve as nutrition educators and counselors by engaging their clients in discussions that would increase their knowledge about disease prevention and management through nutrition. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, where a selfadministered questionnaire was completed by 166 undergraduate consenting third (3rd) and final (4th) year nursing students in a public university in Ghana who answered 20 multiple choice general nutrition questions. An average score of 8.95 +/- 2.01 corresponding to 44.8%, below average, was obtained by the respondents. It was determined that the nutrition knowledge of 3.6%, 62.7% and 33.7% of the study participants was good, adequate and inadequate respectively. It was found that the differences with respect to the nutrition knowledge levels between the age groups, gender, work experience and educational background of respondents were not statistically significant at p < 0.05. The findings of this study support other reports that nurses need more training in nutrition and therefore have important implications for professionals planning curricula for nursing education at the undergraduate level in the university.

Health Policy & Services	There is strong evidence that housing conditions affect population health, but evidence is limited on the extent to which housing with supportive social services can maintain population health and reduce the use of expensive hospital services. We examined a nonprofit, community-based program in Queens, New York, that supplied affordable housing with supportive social services to elderly Medicare beneficiaries. We evaluated whether this program reduced hospital use, including hospital discharges for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). We compared hospital use among an intervention group residing in six high-rise buildings in two neighborhoods to that among their Medicare counterparts living in the same neighborhoods but in different buildings. We found that hospital discharge rates were 32 percent lower, hospital lengths-of-stay one day shorter, and ACSC rates 30 percent lower among residents in the intervention group than among people in the comparison group. This suggests that investments in housing with supportive social services have the potential to reduce hospital use and thereby decrease spending for vulnerable older patients.
Political Science	Prefigurative politics, the idea of 'building the new world in the shell of the old', increasingly forms part of the common sense of radical social and political movements but deserves more careful conceptual analysis. Traditionally, such ideas have been discussed in contrast to 'strategic' politics, but this has been challenged by recent scholarship, which has stressed that they can and should be seen as strategic. This article agrees but points to a more fundamental tension rooted in attempting to enact the future in the present. This is discussed through two broad approaches to prefiguration: ends-guided and ends-effacing. The former leads to a practical dilemma between acting to bring about the future and acting as if it has already been achieved. The latter addresses this, but nonetheless requires further articulation of the relationship between present and future action, which the article argues can be achieved by drawing on ideas from critical pedagogy.
Social Issues	"Universities in the U.S. have been criticized for not contributing enough to the social well-being of the communities within which they operate, and business schools have been accused of failing to prepare students adequately for careers in business. These criticisms have led to increased focus on service learning, a form of experiential learning that aids students in the application of theoretical knowledge to ""real-life"" situations-including problems and opportunities-faced by local as well as international communities. Even though service-learning has become fairly popular in business schools throughout the U.S., there is relatively little literature that illuminates its application. Thus, the present article describes a service-learning project in a marketing research course and how this project supports the university's mission of civic engagement. Included are also a discussion of course-specific objectives as well as learning goals, objectives, and assessments as commonly required by regional and national accreditation agencies."
Rehabilitation	Aim: To describe research on outcomes associated with early Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) use, AFO use patterns, and parent and clinician perspectives on AFO use among young children with cerebral palsy. Method: Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage method was used to conduct a scoping review. MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for studies evaluating AFO use with children under the age of six years. Descriptive information was extracted and outcomes categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Quality assessments were conducted to evaluate methodological rigor. Results: Nineteen articles were included in the review; 14 focused on body functions and structures, seven on activity level outcomes and no studies addressed participation outcomes. Evaluations of the effects of AFOs on gross motor skills other than gait were limited. Overall, the body of evidence is comprised of methodologically weak studies with common threats to validity including inadequate descriptions of study protocols, AFO construction, and comparison interventions. Conclusion: Research evaluating the effects of AFOs on age-appropriate, functional outcomes including transitional movements, floor mobility and participation in early childhood settings is needed to inform practice regarding early orthotic prescription.
Health Policy & Services	Electronic medical records and personal health records have made good progress in reducing costs and inefficiencies, but the key to building a health care delivery system for the twenty-first century is to evolve toward personal health management systems that apply the full power of software to improve patient care. Such systems can enable better outcomes and improve the satisfaction of consumers and providers alike. Through technology innovation, sensible policy approaches, and industrywide collaboration, we can empower individuals to take control of their health while enabling providers and payers to broaden access to higher-quality, more affordable care.

International Relations	3rd party intervention in interstate conflict is a common strategy for mitigating conflict and obtaining a final agreement. However, not all mediations are successful, leading to the development of a rich literature on the mechanisms which decrease the probability of failure in a 3rd-party intervention. Within this literature, some studies examine how a mediator' behavior and incentives affect the result of the mediation. Virtually all these studies assume that the mediator is virtuous such that peace is the most desired outcome of a conflict for her. However, this study challenges this assumption and contends that a mediator can gain benefit from the conflict between disputants. If this benefit is adequately large to overcome the benefits of peace, then the mediator has enough incentive not to conduct the mediation toward a peaceful outcome. We develop a signaling game model to study this issue formally and test the proposed hypothesis empirically.
Urban Studies	"A key aspect of the U.S. subprime crisis was the accumulation of vacant, foreclosed properties in many neighborhoods and localities. This article describes zip-code-level patterns of foreclosed homes, or what are typically called ""real estate owned"" (REO) properties, at the peak of the subprime crisis in late 2008 and estimates a model of REO accumulation from 2006 to 2008. Three key findings emerge. First, during the peak of the subprime foreclosure crisis in late 2008, large central cities, on average, experienced higher levels of REO per mortgageable property than suburban areas. This contradicts some suggestions that the crisis was primarily centered in suburban or exurban communities. Second, the suburbanization of REO varied across two key types of metropolitan areas, with boom-bust regions experiencing more suburbanization than weak- or mixed-market metros. Finally, determinants of zip-code-level REO accumulation included high-risk lending activity and the age of housing stock. After controlling for these and other variables, neither the central city versus suburban location of a zip code nor the proportion of residents commuting over 30 minutes was significantly associated with REO growth. The intrametropolitan location of a zip code appears to have been a less important factor in REO growth than the fact that a large amount of development in newer communities was financed during the subprime boom."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"According to a classical narrative, early geneticists, failing to see how Mendelism provides the missing pieces of Darwin's theory, rejected gradual changes and advocated an implausible yet briefly popular view of evolution-by-mutation; after decades of delay (in which synthesis was prevented by personal conflicts, disciplinary rivalries, and anti-Darwinian animus), Darwinism emerged on a new Mendelian basis. Based on the works of four influential early geneticists - Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Punnett -, and drawing on recent scholarship, we offer an alternative that turns the classical view on its head. For early geneticists, embracing discrete inheritance and the mutation theory (for the origin of hereditary variation) did not entail rejection of selection, but rejection of Darwin's non-Mendelian views of heredity and variation, his doctrine of natura non facit saltum, and his conception of ""natural selection"" as a creative force that shapes features out of masses of infinitesimal differences. We find no evidence of a delay in synthesizing mutation, rules of discrete inheritance, and selection in a Mendelian-Mutationist Synthesis. Instead, before 1918, early geneticists had conceptualized allelic selection, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of a quantitative trait under selection, the probability of fixation of a new mutation, and other key innovations. Contemporary evolutionary thinking seems closer to their more ecumenical view than to the restrictive mid-twentieth-century consensus known as the Modern Synthesis."
Urban Studies	Equity is a crucial goal of American urban policy. The means by which it is pursued via the liberal approach to urban policyaugmented redistributionis problematic, however. What is needed, therefore, is an alternative means to advance equity. Broadening ownership (of productive assets) can be the basis of such an alternative. I discuss how the liberal approach to American urban policy can be transcended by supplanting its Redistributive Paradigm with an Ownership Paradigm.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Soils teem with life, yet only in the last two decades have genomic approaches begun to reveal the secret liveliness of soil. No longer understood as 'abiotic', soil has become a dense genetic web entangling various forms of life, the majority of which remain unidentified. This paper focuses on the growing hopes to identify, categorise, and harness soil liveliness as it emerges from ongoing scientific research at the juncture of soil ecology, molecular biology, and agricultural development. Drawing upon fieldwork interviews and observations with social ecologists in France, we demonstrate how the advancement of soil metagenomics fosters new conceptions of soil as both 'living' and 'labouring'. With these refigurations of soil, soil ecologists anticipate a new agro-ecological revolution in which agrochemicals will be replaced (or at least reduced) through farmers' future employment of biota for soil services. We argue that new understandings of soil as lively and labouring are not only transforming in the sense of fostering a hoped-for agro-ecological transition, but that insights into how underground realms are becoming understood offer new ways into thinking through more-than-human biopolitics and (agricultural) bioeconomies.
Nursing	The Midwifery Development Education Service was established in the Birthing Unit at Middlemore Hospital in South Auckland New Zealand in 2007. The service is unique in the New Zealand midwifery context for the way it operates as a collaboration between the education and health provider to optimise the clinical learning experience of student midwives. This paper reports on the evaluation of the Midwifery Development Education Service that was undertaken in 2015. The evaluation captured the views and experience of students and midwives who had been involved with, or had worked alongside, the service. A mixed-method approach was adopted for the evaluation study, comprising of an anonymous on-line survey, qualitative interviews and focus group discussion. Considerable satisfaction with the service was identified. This article draws attention to participants' perceptions of the service as supporting student midwives; the significance of quality time in the provision of the clinical midwifery education; the situating of the service at a unique vantage point (overseeing the needs of the university and the hospital) and its impact upon the learning culture of education within the unit. A potential tension is also identified between the provision of a supportive learning environment and the assessment of student performance. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Communication	This study examines whether the characteristics of those who share news articles on social media influence the hostile media effect. In an experiment, participants read a news article shared by 1 of 4 Twitter users, 2 (Republican vs. Democrat) x 2 (21 vs. 503,000 followers). Consistent with the hostile media effect, both Republicans and Democrats believed that a news article shared by a Twitter user from an opposing political party was more biased than one shared by a Twitter user from the same political party. As the Twitter account had more followers, however, this effect was more prominent among Republicans and less prominent among Democrats.
Management	Building on a volume of previous work on CI in the supply chain based on the CIMA model, this paper significantly extends the work of Sloan et al. (2005) and Sloan and Sloan (2006) by examining the individual contribution of all organisational departments to organisational CI. We also examine connections between CI dispersion in the organisation and motivations for the implementation of CI; organisational experience with CI; problems encountered with CI implementation; and support and tools used in implementing and monitoring CI. Findings of this study provide support for the proposition that dispersed CI enhances the business performance benefits of CI and that the experience of CI was more positive in firms where CI was dispersed, with fewer implementation problems and higher levels of support and measurement tools. Management in organisations should give serious consideration to strategies which enhance the spread of CI activities throughout their organisations.
Management	"Most online feedback mechanisms rely on voluntary reporting of privately observed outcomes. This introduces the potential for reporting bias, a situation where traders exhibit different propensities to report different outcome types to the system. Unless properly accounted for, reporting bias may severely distort the distribution of public feedback relative to the underlying distribution of private transaction outcomes and, thus, hamper the reliability of feedback mechanisms. This study offers a method that allows users of feedback mechanisms where both partners of a bilateral exchange are allowed to report their satisfaction to ""see through"" the distortions introduced by reporting bias and derive unbiased estimates of the underlying distribution of privately observed outcomes. A key aspect of our method lies in extracting information from the number of transactions where one or both trading partners choose to remain silent. We apply our method to a large data set of eBay feedback. Our results support the widespread belief that eBay traders are more likely to post feedback when satisfied than when dissatisfied and are consistent with the presence of positive and negative reciprocation among eBay traders. Most importantly, our analysis derives unbiased estimates of the risks that are associated with trading on eBay that, we believe, are more realistic than those suggested by a naive interpretation of the unusually high (>99%) levels of positive feedback currently found on that system."
Public Administration	The public administration literature has consistently questioned the validity of satisfaction surveys as a measure of government performance, particularly in comparison with more objective official measures. The authors examine this objective-subjective debate using unique data from a large survey distributed to nearly 1 million parents of children in the New York City public schools along with officially reported measures of school performance for about 900 schools. Their results suggest that the official measures of school performance are significant and important predictors of aggregate parental satisfaction, even after controlling for school and student characteristics. They conclude that public school parents form their satisfaction judgment in ways that correspond fairly closely with officially measured school performance. The results can also be interpreted as suggesting that the official performance measures reflect, at least in part, aspects of public schooling that matter to parents.
Criminology & Penology	"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess perceptions of body-worn cameras (BWCs) among citizens who had BWC-recorded police encounters, and to explore the potential for a civilizing effect on citizen behavior. Design/methodology/approach - From June to November 2015, the authors conducted telephone interviews with 249 citizens in Spokane (WA) who had a recent BWC-recorded police encounter. Findings - Respondents were satisfied with how they were treated during the police encounter and, overall, had positive attitudes about BWCs. However, only 28 percent of respondents were actually aware of the BWC during their own encounter. The authors also found little evidence of a civilizing effect but did document a significant, positive connection between awareness of the BWC and enhanced perceptions of procedural justice. Research limitations/implications - Authors only interviewed citizens who had encounters with officers wearing BWCs. However, variation in BWC awareness among citizens allowed the authors to construct a proxy ""non-BWC condition"" for comparison. Practical implications - The pre-conditions necessary to produce a civilizing effect among citizens are complex and difficult to achieve. The intriguing relationship between BWC awareness and procedural justice suggests the technology may have the potential to improve police legitimacy. Originality/value - The study is among the first to explore attitudes about BWCs among those who have their police encounters recorded, and results demonstrate high levels of support among this population. Findings bode well for continued adoption of BWCs in policing."
Education & Educational Research	To reduce effectively the reading anxiety of learners while reading English articles, a C4.5 decision tree, a widely used data mining technique, was used to develop a personalized reading anxiety prediction model (PRAPM) based on individual learners' reading annotation behavior in a collaborative digital reading annotation system (CDRAS). In addition to forecasting immediately the reading anxiety levels of learners, the proposed PRAPM can be used to identify the key factors that cause reading anxiety based on the fired prediction rules determined by the developed decision tree. By understanding these key factors that cause reading anxiety, instructors can apply reading strategies to reduce reading anxiety, thus promoting English-language reading performance. To assess whether the proposed PRAPM can assist instructors in reducing the reading anxiety of learners, this study applies the quasi-experimental method to compare the learning performance of three learning groups, which are, respectively, supported by a CDRAS with individual annotations, collaborative annotations, and collaborative annotations with online instructor's support to reduce reading anxiety by the proposed PRAPM. The instructional experiment was conducted on Grade 7 students at Taipei Municipal Wan-Fang high school. Experimental results indicate that the average correct prediction rate of the proposed PRAPM in identifying the reading anxiety levels of learners was as high as 70%. Moreover, analytical results show that the collaborative annotation with online instructor's support for reducing reading anxiety by the proposed PRAPM indeed helps learners reduce reading anxiety, particularly for the male learners, showing that gender difference exists. Furthermore, based on online instructor's support for reducing reading anxiety by the proposed PRAPM, the correlation analysis also shows that the online instructor's interaction with the male learners is significantly correlated with the reading anxiety reduction. Furthermore, English-language learning performance of the three learners groups, which were given a CDRAS with different learning mechanisms, was significantly promoted.
History	The reason that led to this paper is the ancient controversy about the use of classical art by Giambattista Tiepolo. It is evident from figurative comparisons between the engravings from his drawings and his paintings that the artist first has faithfully copied the classical models and then he changed them with different variations.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Latent Markov (LM) models are increasingly used in a wide range of research areas including psychological, sociological, educational, and medical sciences. Methods to perform power computations are lacking, however. This article presents methods for preforming power analysis in LM models. Two cases of tests of hypotheses on the transition parameters of LM models are considered. The first case concerns the situation where the likelihood ratio test statistic follows a chi-square distribution, implying that the power computation can also be based on this theoretical distribution. In the second case, power needs to be computed based on empirical distributions constructed via Monte Carlo methods. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the proposed power computation methods and to investigate design factors affecting the power of this test.
Linguistics	"When interpreting disjunctive sentences of the form ""A or B"", young children have been reported to differ from adults in two ways. First, children have been reported to interpret disjunction inclusively rather than exclusively, accepting ""A or B"" in contexts in which both A and B are true (Chierchia et al. 2001; Gualmini et al. 2001). Second, some children have been reported to interpret disjunction conjunctively, rejecting ""A or B"" in contexts in which only one of the disjuncts is true (Paris 1973; Braine & Rumain 1981; Chierchia et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2015). In this article, we extend the investigation of children""s interpretation of disjunction to include both simple and complex forms of disjunction, in two typologically unrelated languages: French and Japanese. First, given that complex disjunctions have been argued to give rise to obligatory exclusivity inferences (Spector 2014), we investigated whether the obligatoriness of the inference would play a role in the acquisition of the exclusive interpretation. Second, using a paradigm that makes the use of disjunction felicitous, we aimed to establish whether the finding of conjunctive interpretations would be replicated for both simple and complex forms of disjunction, and in languages other than English. The main findings from our experiment are that both French-and Japanese-speaking children interpreted the simple and complex disjunctions either inclusively or conjunctively; in contrast, adults generally accessed exclusive readings of both disjunctions. We argue that our results lend further support to the proposal put forth in Singh et al. (2015), according to which the reason some children compute conjunctive meanings while adults compute exclusivemeanings is that the two groups differ in their respective sets of alternatives for disjunction. Crucially, adults access conjunction as an alternative to disjunction, and compute exclusive interpretations; in contrast, children access only the individual disjuncts as alternatives, and therefore either interpret the disjunction literally or compute conjunctive inferences. More generally, our findings can be explained quite naturally within recent proposals according to which children differ from adults in the computation of scalar inferences because they are more restricted than adults in the set of scalar alternatives they can access (Barner et al. 2011; Tieu et al. 2015b, among others)."
Linguistics	This paper examines the main challenges of translating English compounds into Arabic. Compounding is linguistically a common process across many languages where compounds are frequently formed. In English compounding is highly creative and innovative, and often used as a means of introducing new phrases or coining new words into the lexicon. In contrast, Arabic is less resourceful. Arabic does not possess similar multiword expressions as an integral linguistic mechanism that merges language items to form a unit of language that can be broken down into single words and display idiosyncratic features. (Sag et al. 2002). As the English text-writer and the Arabic translator use their respective languages from different mental pictures and from disparate thought processes, each operates from a different worldview, so transferring English compounds often leads to loss of meaning. Understanding and interpreting compounds has been a long-standing area of interest in Indo-European language research but remains under-researched in Arabic. This paper contributes to the debate on how to deal with English compounds in Arabic.
Demography	Does population diversity matter for economic development in the long run? Is there a different impact of diversity across time? This paper traces the short-, medium- and long-term economic impact of population diversity resulting from the big migration waves of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to the United States (US). Using census data from 1880, 1900 and 1910, the settlement pattern of migrants across the counties of the 48 US continental states is tracked in order to construct measures of population fractionalization and polarization at county level. Factors which may have influenced both the individual settlement decision at the time of migration and county-level economic development in recent years are controlled for. The results of the analysis show that high levels of population fractionalization have a strong and positive influence on economic development in the short, medium and long run. High levels of polarization, by contrast, undermine development. Despite a stronger effect on income levels in the first 30 years, we find these relationships to be extremely long lasting: counties with a more heterogeneous population composition over 130 years ago are significantly richer today, whereas counties that were strongly polarized at the time of the migration waves have endured persistent negative economic effects.
History	"At the end of an interdisciplinary conference on ""Feud in Medieval and Early Modern Europe,"" held in Aarhus, Denmark in 2003, the participants realized we could not agree on a definition of the feud, and we were left with a certain ""definitional incoherence."" In the hope that scholarship can make progress, this paper proposes to build upon the Denmark conference. This paper suggests that the feud should be understood as a spectrum of behaviors and values. Part of the task is to identify the boundaries of the feuding spectrum, so that all acts of reciprocal violence do not collapse into it. At one end of the spectrum were those acts most distant from the power of the state, exemplified by the customary law of the Kanun of the Albanian mountains. At the other end of the spectrum might be cases of feuding that hid under the blanket of the ragione dello stato and statutory law, cases in which the laws of the monarch repudiated private justice in favor of public norms but that in practice allowed certain privileged persons to continue to pursue feuds. The paper examines the role of Emperor Charles V in the assassination of Lorenzino de' Medici, himself the assassin of Duke Alessandro de' Medici, the Emperor's son-in-law. In between these two extremes were numerous examples of perpetrators of violent acts who negotiated their way along the spectrum to maximize the chances of success during a period of deep social conflict over the honorable and legal ways to redress grievances. There is a certain paradox in my thesis: although the customary codes of the feud implied rigid obligations to maintain honor, feuding parties made choices about where to situate themselves on the spectrum."
Law	The recent enforcement of the GDPR has put extra burdens to data controllers operating within the EU. Beyond other challenges, the exercise of the Right to be Forgotten by individuals who request erasure of their personal information has also become a thorny issue when applied to backups and archives. In this paper, we discuss the GDPR forgetting requirements in respect with their impact on the backup and archiving procedures stipulated by the modern security standards. We specifically examine the implications of erasure requests on current IT backup systems and we highlight a number of envisaged organizational, business and technical challenges pertained to the widely known backup standards, data retention policies, backup mediums, search services, and ERP systems.

Cultural Studies	In recent years, Sir Jack Goody has published a series of essays (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006: 154-79) criticizing Norbert Elias's theory of 'civilizing processes'. In all of them, Goody - himself a West African specialist - makes clear that his disagreement with Elias dates back to their acquaintance in Ghana. The date is highly significant for it is unlikely that Goody's opinions of Elias's ideas were initially formed by his reading of Elias's publications. There were also important differences between them in their approaches to theories of long-term social development. Despite appearances to the contrary, Elias and Goody have in fact much in common intellectually. Goody is one of the most historically orientated of anthropologists, and many points of contact with Elias are evident in his work on literacy (1968, 1987), food (1982), or The Domestication of the Savage Mind (1977). Both swam against the ahistorical current of their respective disciplines and both rejected the old notion of 'progress'. Elias's fault is that occasionally his formulations may appear to give the opposite impression. Goody's fault, perhaps, is that - in spite of his own historical perspective - under any model of a structured process he suspects there lurks a vision of progress and of European superiority.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Using data from IRS Form 5500, this study examines the causes and consequences of the shift toward participant direction of investments in defined contribution plans. The analysis reveals that collective bargaining and pension investments in employer stock reduce the chance of a switch to participant direction, whereas below average returns increases the chance. Also, a switch to participant direction increases employee contributions to the pension and reduces the share of assets invested in employer securities.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Social studies of science have often treated natural field sites as extensions of the laboratory. But this overlooks the unique specificities of field sites. While lab sites are usually private spaces with carefully controlled borders, field sites are more typically public spaces with fluid boundaries and diverse inhabitants. Field scientists must therefore often adapt their work to the demands and interests of local agents. I propose to address the difference between lab and field in sociological terms, as a difference in style. A field style treats epistemic alterity as a resource rather than an obstacle for objective knowledge production. A sociological stylistics of the field should thus explain how objective science can co-exist with radical conceptual difference. I discuss examples from the Canadian North, focussing on collaborations between state wildlife biologists and managers, on the one hand, and local Aboriginal Elders and hunters, on the other. I argue that a sociological stylistics of the field can help us to better understand how radically diverse agents may collaborate across cultures in the successful production of reliable natural knowledge.

Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Events, such as festivals, have been identified as places in which activities are provided for participants to develop skills and build their leisure careers. This study aimed to explore the leisure and tourist behaviours of serious, and at times fanatical, participants at the Wintersun Festival in Queensland, Australia. The weeklong nostalgic celebration of music, dancing, cars and lifestyles attracts participants from distant communities to travel and participate in the activities that are integral to achieving their leisure goals. This study utilised participant observation to identify nine domains which describe and explain the behaviours of participants including specialised travel, lifestyle, identity reinforcement, pride, fanaticism, social interaction, fixated consumption, competition and skill development. The results highlight the specialised travel experience undertaken by participants and the important role of events in fulfilling their personal and social goals.

Nursing	Effective clinical supervision in midwifery programs leading to registration is essential to ensure that students can provide safe and competent woman centred care by the completion of their program. A number of different clinical supervision models exist in Australia and internationally, with varying levels of support and facilitation of student learning opportunities. In Australia, midwifery students must achieve specified learning outcomes and midwifery practice requirements to be eligible to register as a midwife. Identifying a best practice clinical supervision model for Australian midwifery students is therefore a priority for all key stakeholders, particularly education and maternity care providers. The aim of this literature review was to explore different types of clinical supervision models in order to develop and implement a best practice model in midwifery education programs.

History Of Social Sciences	Although clearly a key institutional framework that structures planning systems, there has been remarkably little attention by planning historians to the comparative study of institutions of property rights in land as a factor shaping approaches to urban planning. Conversely, planning has clearly functioned as a key site of institutional innovation shaping the evolution of property rights. This relationship between planning and property rights deserves greater attention. Although property rights are often entrenched in written constitutions as is the case in both Japan and the USA, and do exhibit considerable continuity over time, they are in fact seldom static, being subject to evolving interpretations and constraints. This paper employs a historical institutionalist approach in the examination of the evolution of institutions of property rights in Japan during the modern period, from just before the Meiji Revolution of 1867-1868 to the early twenty-first century. The paper shows that the strong protection of landed property rights in Japan is a product of the Meiji period, not the post-Second World War occupation, and argues that institutional choices in framing landed property rights have multiple and varied long-term impacts that may have little to do with the original policy goals.
Urban Studies	The quality of property tax assessment practices impacts the stability of local government revenue and the equity of property tax burden. This study examines the potential shift in property tax burden associated with concentrations of foreclosures while taking into account a procedural transition from a lagged market versus a current market valuation standard. The findings suggest that property tax administration matters, especially with a growing number of foreclosures. In the case studied, current market value assessments partially mitigate equity consequences of nearby foreclosure sales. It is concluded that foreclosures have a relatively small but significant negative effect on the change in assessed values of nearby properties. That shift mitigates the over-assessment associated with foreclosures under a lagged assessment standard. However, the analysis illuminates the continued complexity of achieving horizontal equity in the property tax base within or near higher concentrations of foreclosures after the transition to current market value assessment.
Demography	Most literature on migration governance has addressed the global level, and it has done so primarily from a state-centric and top-down perspective, with little regard to the role of civil society organizations in shaping its direction. Moreover, in an institutional sense, except for the EU, the regional level has only received scant attention, which is surprising given the significance of intra-regional migration flows elsewhere. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a case in point. Although there are few direct channels of engagement for civil society, the vibrant migrant rights community in Asia has been capitalizing on, and creating, opportunities at multiple levels including the regional. Our argument is that this creative use of channels of engagement in combined form at multiple levels can have democratizing potential.
History	This article analyses the role played by young women with regard to the configuration of the anti-fascist movement in Mediterranean Europe from Hitler's coming into power to the end of World War II. The weakness of the young women's associations until 1933 is explained by the economic and social underdevelopment of this area. However, the situations of extreme emergency that took place from that year would reinforced the activist networks and, above all, encouraged the emergence of thousands of individual contributions to the anti-fascist fight by young women who did not belong to any particular organization.
Geography	This paper presents hydrogeological mapping of the Peligna Valley (Central Italy) intramontane basin. The basin is hydrogeologically complex due to the significant surface and underground water resources which are extensively used for potable, industrial, agricultural and healing purposes. The basin history is characterised by significant fluvio-lacustrine deposition whose thickness can reach as much as 500 m. The depositional environment is completely surrounded by calcareous mountains. These represent extensive aquifers which feed large regional point and linear springs with total discharges of 16 m(3)/s. The highly complex hydrogeology of the study area and the varied use of water resources required extensive data collation and geological and hydrogeological assessments. Two years worth of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical monitoring of wells, springs, rivers and particularly artificial channels that convey water for industrial, hydroelectric and irrigational purposes were also undertaken. The construction of an accurate spatial-temporal database allowed the assessment and mapping of complex relationships between superficial water and groundwater. These relationships are shown in the 1: 25,000 scale map. The map has been compiled using a detailed descriptive legend, various hydrogeological sections, schematics of anthropogenic activities, diagrams and tables and, finally, four schematics at 1: 150,000 scale showing risk of contamination. It is hoped that this layout will assist in reading the map independently from any other supporting material.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a new technology used in prenatal testing (PT) that capitalizes on genomic platforms to transform DNA fragments in the blood of pregnant women into information about the genome of a foetus. Since its market introduction in 2011, it has travelled around the globe with remarkable speed. This article engages with the emergence of NIPT in and around Vienna, the capital city of Austria, to explore why and how this technology could travel so quickly in practice. Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews, documents, and field notes, it argues, first, that NIPT could travel so quickly because it travelled as 'adaptable boxes' that added on to different 'local worlds of prenatal testing (PT)', without disrupting them. Second, in so doing, NIPT could travel on a moral and material ground, or an 'imaginary of PT', built in the past. Third, the article argues that elements of this imaginary were also mobilized by commercial pioneers of NIPT, who 'infrastructurized' extant values, practices, and networks among biomedical professionals. Thus, various actors converged in mobilizing moral and material elements of an imaginary, transforming them into an infrastructure that facilitated the travels of NIPT, while also shaping its use.
History Of Social Sciences	This article aims to provide an overview of the historiography of psychology textbooks. In the overview, I identify and describe in detail two strands of writing histories of introductory textbooks of psychology and juxtapose them to provide an integrated historiography of textbooks in psychology. One strand is developed by teachers of psychology-first as a general approach for investigating textbooks in a pedagogical setting, and then later upgraded into a full history of psychology textbooks in America. The other strand follows a more familiar perspective of historians of science and historians of psychologywho build on various post-Kuhnian and post-Foucauldian perspectives on textbooks. I make an argument for integrating these two views for a more comprehensive historiography of textbooks in psychology, recasting textbooks as objects of research and sources that are interesting sui generis for historians of psychology in their investigations.

Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objectives. To assess the environmental justice implications of flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Greater Houston, Texas, we analyzed whether the areal extent of flooding was distributed inequitably with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, after controlling for relevant explanatory factors. Methods. Our study integrated cartographic information from Harvey's Inundation Footprint, developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, with sociodemographic data from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses were based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results. The areal extent of Harvey-induced flooding was significantly greater in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black and socioeconomically deprived residents after we controlled for contextual factors and clustering. Conclusions. Results provide evidence of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic injustices in the distribution of flooding and represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of disproportionate impacts associated with Hurricane Harvey. Public Health Implications. Our findings highlight the need to prepare for and address the unequal social consequences of climate change-related disasters, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity.
Health Policy & Services	Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we analyzed the relationship between specialty physician location and specialty-specific mortality rates for diagnoses where access to specialty expertise could plausibly reduce death rates. After adjustment for demographic and health indicators, counties with the highest quartile specialty physician density had lower mortality rates compared to counties with the lowest quartile. The observed association in endocrinology, infectious disease, and neurology was 10.7, 2.9 and 7.2 fewer deaths per 100,000 residents, respectively. There is an inverse correlation between the distribution of select specialties and population-level mortality.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The use of agent-based models (ABMs) has increased in the last years to simulate social systems and, in particular, financial markets. ABMs of financial markets are usually validated by checking the ability of the model to reproduce a set of empirical stylised facts. However, other common-sense evidence is available which is often not taken into account, ending with models which are valid but not sensible. In this paper we present an ABM of a stock market which incorporates this type of common-sense evidence and implements realistic trading strategies based on practitioners literature. We next validate the model using a comprehensive approach consisting of four steps: assessment of face validity, sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation of model outputs.
Nursing	Purpose: Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug commonly used to treat children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Unfortunately, half of children taking MTX will experience MTX intolerance, which includes distressing gastrointestinal and behavioural symptoms associated with weekly MTX treatment. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perceptions of school-age children with JIA experiencing MTX intolerance, how they managed MTX intolerance, and how it impacted their daily life. Design and methods: An interpretive descriptive design was used. Twelve children participated in one individual 30-minute semi-structured interview using a storyboard technique to elicit their perceptions through storytelling. Interview transcripts and observational data collected during the interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Children described MTX intolerance as extremely challenging. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) No kid likes taking MTX. This theme was comprised of two subthemes related to: (a) associative MTX intolerance; namely, Talking about it sometimes makes me feel sick; and (b) anticipatory MTX intolerance, Before [I take it], I have a little stomach ache. Other themes included: (2) The importance of strategies and routines; and (3) Working hard to live with MTX intolerance. Conclusions: This study sheds newlight on MTX intolerance as perceived by school-aged children with JIA. Results highlight the importance of providing families and healthcare professionals with the necessary information for early recognition of MTX intolerance and optimizing care through the development of early intervention strategies. Practice implications: Study findings highlight the importance of prioritizing early identification and prevention of MTX intolerance. Crown Copyright (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Social Work	Concepts describing secondary trauma phenomena do not adequately capture the profound impact that collective catastrophic events can have on mental health professionals living and working in traumatogenic environments. Shared trauma, by contrast, contains aspects of primary and secondary trauma, and more accurately describes the extraordinary experiences of clinicians exposed to the same community trauma as their clients. Case vignettes from clinicians in Manhattan and Sderot, Israel are provided to illustrate the transformative changes that clinicians may undergo as a result of dual exposure to trauma. Discussion involves the importance of articulating one's own trauma narrative and attending to self-care prior to resuming clinical work, as well as opportunities for enhanced therapeutic intimacy and caution regarding boundary alterations that may result from clinician self-disclosure. Agency settings can provide the necessary education, supervision, and support to mitigate the negative effects of shared trauma.
History	This article uses a wide range of evidence, including images and accounts front foreigners (primarily English and German travellers) to place the early history of coffee and cafes in France in a sharp comparative perspective. These references to the contexts of coffee consumption (where, with whom and with what other products did one consume coffee?) allow us to test and reframe key claims linking cafes, the public sphere, gender and social hierarchy in the Old Regime. The rise of the Parisian caf was shaped by fears about the social inclusivity of tobacco smoke, questions of access for elite women, a focus on luxury decor and a distinctive approach to conversation and sociability. A careful exploration of these contexts of consumption can qualify and nuance our view of the cafe as a locus of the public sphere in the first half-century of public coffee-drinking in Paris.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Keith DeRose and Stewart Cohen object to the fallibilist strand of pragmatic invariantism regarding knowledge ascriptions that it is committed to non-cancelable pragmatic implications. I show that this objection points us to an asymmetry about which aspects of the conveyed content of knowledge ascriptions can be canceled: we can cancel those aspects that ascribe a lesser epistemic standing to the subject but not those that ascribe a better or perfect epistemic standing. This situation supports the infallibilist strand of pragmatic invariantism according to which knowledge semantically requires absolute certainty but this claim is often pragmatically weakened: it turns out that exactly those aspects of the conveyed content are cancelable that this view claims are pragmatic. I also argue that attributor contextualism and relativism do not have an alternative explanation of this phenomenon.
Geography	This article examines the dynamics of double exposure, vulnerability, and resistance to neoliberal globalization and environmental change in the Chilean agricultural region of Biobio. By using climatic models and secondary Agricultural Census data from 1997 and 2007, we assess how Chilean neoliberal reforms have, since 1974, facilitated land use changes and forestry investments. We demonstrate that policy changes which incentivize forestry investments have reduced cultivated agricultural lands and native forest, and concentrated land in the hands of global agribusiness corporations. Compounding these issues, Biobio shows a climatic trend towards aridity coupled with an increasing demand for irrigation. Analyzing these conditions, we argue that the neoliberal globalization of regional agriculture under the context of climatic changes has produced a regional space of increasing vulnerabilities and uneven geographical development in Biobio. We particularly demonstrate that the Chilean mode of agricultural neoliberalization has been conducive to land dispossession to the detriment of traditional agriculture and has homogenized the biophysical landscape, replacing traditional crops and native forests with exotic species like pines and eucalyptus. We also examine how local producers are using resistance movements to cope with and contest neoliberal environmental changes. We conclude by evaluating the implications of these spaces of agricultural vulnerabilities and local resistances in the context of uneven geographical development at a regional and global scale.

Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In this article, we propose a nonlinear dynamic latent class structural equation modeling (NDLC-SEM). It can be used to examine intra-individual processes of observed or latent variables. These processes are decomposed into parts which include individual- and time-specific components. Unobserved heterogeneity of the intra-individual processes are modeled via a latent Markov process that can be predicted by individual- and time-specific variables as random effects. We discuss examples of sub-models which are special cases of the more general NDLC-SEM framework. Furthermore, we provide empirical examples and illustrate how to estimate this model in a Bayesian framework. Finally, we discuss essential properties of the proposed framework, give recommendations for applications, and highlight some general problems in the estimation of parameters in comprehensive frameworks for intensive longitudinal data.
Family Studies	This article analyzes changes in the division of routine domestic work after first parenthood. We wanted to know whether and how it was possible for couples to resist the trend toward traditionalization that has been shown in the literature. To do so, we analyze semistructured interviews with 27 Spanish couples who were expecting their first child in 2011 and interviewed them again in 2013. The couples were selected from a bigger sample because of their nontraditional practices preparenthood. Our results show that 17 of them were able to maintain a nontraditional division of domestic work, whereas 10 traditionalized. In our analysis, relative resources and time availability did not sufficiently explain the changes in the division of work, but specific characteristics of the division of work before childbirthmen's active participation, the routinization of tasks, and flexible standardsemerged as key factors to resist the trend toward more traditional arrangements.
Social Work	Curriculum and psychoeducational groups have become increasingly popular because of their strong evidence base and presumed ease of implementation. The curriculum provides a valuable guide to social workers leading groups as they decide on topics for discussion. Typically, the literature emphasizes the content-the material being presented-over the process: the ways in which members interact with one another and with the leader. The authors of this article contend that when the social worker adheres too rigidly to the content, members' ability to make meaning of and internalize the information being presented is compromised. They advocate for an approach to group facilitation that emphasizes flexible presentation of curriculum topics. The benefits of group participation are maximized when collaborative learning, which involves members' interactions with one another and the leader, is encouraged. The article includes a summary of the theoretical foundation and evidence base of psychoeducational and curriculum groups and presents strategies to promote collaborative learning using case examples.
History	This article uses the case of exotic comestibles consumed in the Low Countries to study the problem of continuity versus transformation in early modern consumer behaviour. The paradigm of changing consumer behaviour resulting from the emergence of the market economy has increasingly been rejected by scholars of late medieval and Renaissance material culture. However, an integrated approach that attempts to bridge the conceptual and methodological gap has so far been missing. By examining a large body of discursive sources on the introduction of exotic comestibles in the early modern Low Countries from a fresh theoretical perspective (that of conventions theory), this article proposes a novel reconciliation between the two perspectives on the history of consumption before the Industrial Revolution. The focus on exotic goods also allows for a nuanced perspective on the role of the non-western world in shaping new consumer patterns, and contributing to the great transformation in European economy and society.
Communication	The 2016 vote to leave the European Union was one of the biggest developments in recent United Kingdom political history. Only one political party was wholly united for Brexit - the United Kingdom Independence Party. This research finds that in the years leading up to Brexit, the United Kingdom Independence Party presented itself as a rigid core-issue complete-populist party. Content analysis shows how pervasive the European Union was in much of the party output and in the contemporaneous newspaper coverage of the party. The party also utilizes complete-populist rhetoric, with 'othering' populism as the most prevalent form. The consistent concentration on the European Union collocated with populist messaging, in both news releases and select newspaper coverage, may have helped afford the United Kingdom Independence Party issue-eliteness in the referendum campaign. But this same work may have also ultimately contributed to make them irrelevant by 2017, and possibly moribund by 2018.
History	The authors explain how the newly created thematic portals can be used to facilitate digital research in Italian state archives.
Political Science	Party member women's organizations were early features of party development. While some contemporary studies maintain these are important sites for the substantive representation of women, there is also a claim that they are in decline. Our primary purpose here is to establish the existence of party member women's organizations - as one test of the first dimension of party feminization: the inclusion of women. We draw on new survey data of 17 European countries provided by Scarrow, Poguntke and Webb. We establish that almost half have a party member women's organization. The new data also permits analysis of relationships between party member women's organization and gender quotas for the top party leadership body (National Executive Committee (NEC)), women's presence among the party leadership and candidate quota rules. Together we see these (i) as a means to establish whether women are marginalized within the party, thereby limiting descriptive representation and (ii) as surrogate measures for women's substantive representation. We importantly find that the presence of a party member women's organization does not come at the cost of women's presence on the NEC. In the final section, we turn our attention to building a new comparative research agenda that more fully addresses substantive representation.
Business	Business use of cloud computing services is motivated by ease of use and potential financial cost reductions. Service failure may occur when the service provider does not protect information or when the use of the services becomes overly complex and difficult. The benefits of cloud computing also bring optimization challenges for the information owners who must assess service security risks and the degree to which new human behaviors are required. In this research, we look at the risk of identity theft when ease of service access is provided through a single sign-on (SSO) authorization, asking: What are the optimal behavioral expectations for a cloud service information owner? Federated identity management provides well-developed design literature on strategies for optimizing human behaviors in relation to the new technologies. We briefly review the literature and then propose a working solution that optimizes the trade-off between disclosure risk, human user risk, and service security.

Ethnic Studies	Using Anthony Giddens' structuration theory, this article analyzes the specific ways refused asylum seekers use agency to find employment, despite a legal framework that prevents them working. It is based on a total of 34 semi-structured interviews conducted in Paris. Three points are to be noted. Firstly, there is a hierarchy in the type of jobs available: the most popular jobs can be accessed by borrowing the identity of a third person with regular status, while people who cannot use this means are confined to jobs on the more precarious fringes of the job market. Secondly, our research highlights the existence of an informal labor market that asylum seekers can approach, sometimes even before their asylum application is filed. It is also a space for discussion, advice, and contact with other undocumented job seekers, accessible in specific locations or via the Internet. Thirdly, any long-term prospects are hindered by the precariousness of a person's migration status: although French legislation officially makes regularization possible, under certain conditions, for people who can justify working without ID, our research reveals a series of obstacles on the ground that make this prospect unlikely. In addition to analyzing the current institutional situation, this research focuses on migrant agency, which is crucial to understanding the hidden aspects of migration.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This paper presents the results of a leisure study conducted in Indian domestic sector. Nineteen dimensions related to social, travel, destination and miscellaneous aspects were considered to identify their influence on leisure destination choices. These dimensions were administered in a questionnaire form to domestic tourists at two cities in India, Tirupati and Hyderabad. Tirupati has a distinct religious value and Hyderabad has a historical and cultural heritage character. Preliminary data analysis indicated that tourists' decisions were generally influenced by aspects relating to safety, economics and comfort. However, factor analysis identified three significant factors for each destination. It was observed that factors pre-decision' and destination-specific' were influencing tourists' preferences at both the destinations. In addition, factors safety and comfort' and comfort and economics' were found influencing the choices of tourists at religious destination and historical and cultural heritage destination, respectively. Statistical tests indicated that there was significant difference between the mean scores for all the identified factors at the two destinations. Therefore, implementation of a general strategy for tourism promotion will not be effective. The results of the present study can be extended to other destination values and to identify the decision-making path of domestic tourists using structural equation modelling.
Transportation	2014 marks the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web. We have seen some remarkable developments as part of the digital age revolution in the last quarter of a century. These have taken place concurrently with a motor age that is possibly past its prime. A number of major motor manufacturers have faced disappointing sales or financial crisis alongside several countries seeing a halt to the historic trend of growing car use. The co-existence of the motor age and the digital age prompts this paper to consider the hypothesis that society is undergoing a fundamental transition from a regime of automobility to something significantly different. The paper considers what has characterized the motor age and proceeds to examine the digital revolution and how this is changing people's opportunity to access people, goods services and opportunities. The range of interactions between the motor age and the digital age are addressed, underlining the difficulty in establishing the net consequence of one for the other. The new debates concerning 'peak car' are considered in which the digital age is identified as potentially one key factor responsible for observed changes in car use. The paper then focuses upon a socio-technical conceptualization of society known as the Multi-Layer Perspective to examine its hypothesis. The hypothesis remains neither supported nor not supported. Transport's future in the digital age is uncertain and the paper sets out some views on resulting policy considerations and research needs.
History	Wapentake courts continued to play an important role in the administration of the West Riding throughout the early-modern period and for much of the nineteenth century. This can be demonstrated from the surviving court records of the six wapentake courts of the honour of Pontefract. These show that wapentake courts, acting as sheriff's tourns, performed a central function in early-modern local administration. All the township officers within their jurisdictions, including constables, sworn men (bye-law men) and pinders, were sworn into office at sittings of these courts. The roles of these different township officers are made clear. These courts and the seigneurial courts with jurisdiction over civil suits were inter-dependant, as were the wapentake courts and the courts of quarter sessions. Evolutionary changes in the sittings and functions of these courts are described. The wapentake courts were undermined by nineteenth century reforms of policing and to courts for debt litigation, which eventually led to the final abandonment of these courts despite local support for their continuation.
Political Science	"Studies of ""waves"" of regime change, in which large numbers of countries experience similar political transitions at roughly similar periods of time, though once popular, have fallen from favor. Replacing the ""third wave"" arguments are several competing models relating domestic social structure-specifically, the distribution of income and factor ownership-to regime type. If any of these distributive models of regime type is correct, then global trade has an important explanatory role to play. Under factor-based models, changes in the world trading system will have systematic effects on regime dynamics. Trade openness determines labor's factor income and ultimately its political power. As world trade expands and contracts, countries with similar labor endowments should experience similar regime pressures at the same time. We propose a novel empirical specification that addresses the endogeneity and data-quality problems plaguing previous efforts to examine these arguments. We investigate the conditional impact of the global trading system on democratic transitions across 130 years and all of the states in the international system. Our findings cast doubt on the utility of factor-based models of democratization, despite their importance in fueling renewed interest in the topic."
Ethnic Studies	This work provides an analysis of the structure and transformations of the official political debate over immigration control within the Italian political elite over the last three decades. Through a close historical reading of the Italian political scene based primarily on parliamentary debates, this article charts the key policy frames articulated in different periods of Italian immigration history in relation to the nature of the immigration control problem (cognitive dimension) and the suggested policy solutions (normative dimension). Moreover, it highlights the various factors - from party competition and political ideologies to the pressure of interest groups, the characteristics of national political institutions and the normative pressure from Europe and European institutions - that have influenced immigration policy frames and have interacted with them in shaping policy goals.
Public Administration	Local governments face a tightening economic bind while struggling to balance obligations to protect their communities. As populations change and hazards expand, they confront a mounting number of threats while trying to maintain basic services. This article examines demands and constraints that are placed on government agencies in providing public safety and public health services. The authors recommend building interagency cooperation to maximize the utility of existing staff and resources. These distributed systems increase the flexibility and resilience of the community as well as the cooperating organizations. It is a paradigm shift from organization-centric thinking toward a coordinated effort to build resilience for the whole community.
Social Issues	"The universal context that this paper builds on relates to the theme of language as a form of cultural identity and the role it plays in education. The question that guides this research, is whether one variety of the Afrikaans language referred to as Kaapsi is owned by its speakers in such a way that it not only underpins the individual and collective identities of those Afrikaans-speaking people classified as Coloured(2) and marginalised by poverty, location and race, but it could also contribute to the successful delivery of the school curriculum in those schools attended mainly by the Coloured population. A socio-historical perspective on the history of the Kaaps language since the early 1600s is reflected in a literature review, providing a backdrop to the current status of Kaaps among the coloured community; its rivalry with standard Afrikaans; the influence of Kaaps on its speakers' perception of their own identity; whether the CAPS' makes provision for the teaching of Kaaps, and if so to what extent the language is used in South African schools. From the earliest days of South African history political decisions were taken to ensure that White and Coloured and Black people lived apart from one another. The racial label ""Coloured"" inflicted deep wounds and created a lot of bitterness. Because Coloureds in the Cape lived apart from their fellow Afrikaans speakers for such a long time, the respective language communities also grew further apart: Kaaps eventually developed alongside Standard Afrikaans. The earliest manifestations of Kaaps were recorded before Jan van Riebeeck set foot at the Cape on behalf of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1652. At a time when most Afrikaners in Cape Town were becoming anglicised, Muslims played a large role in developing Kaaps. Despite the Dutch origins and lyrics of Cape Muslim music, this cultural contribution was never acknowledged and very little of it was documented The logical deduction following from these observations is that the ""Coloured voice"" simply could not be part of the canon of Afrikaans literature, because the Afrikaans spoken by most Coloured people (Kaaps) was regarded as a deviation from Standard Afrikaans. Most Coloured scholars are of the opinion that Standard Afrikaans does not represent the total language community of Afrikaans speakers. Yet the process of standardisation continued to deny the creole nature of Afrikaans, and the language was purified by the elimination of Khoi, Malay and slave influences. Another point of concern is that Kaaps is often disparagingly referred to as a joke language, thus conveying a stigma around the language. For many white speakers of Afrikaans the standard version of the language is part of their identity and defines who and what they are. It is no different for Coloured speakers of Afrikaans, but they are less outspoken about it. Against this background, the place of Coloured poets and writers who wrote in Afrikaans has always been controversial. After 1994 schools were no longer separated and today integrated schools are a common phenomenon. But the legacy of apartheid education is still evident, for example, in the level of literacy in the Coloured and Black communities, which is much lower than that in the White communities. This is the result of years of non-development of language proficiency among Coloured people, because Kaaps was dismissed as sub-standard This led to bitterness because children who grew up with Kaaps had to learn in Standard Afrikaans and the prescribed textbooks portrayed a different world to the one in which they lived A core aspect in the delivery of the curriculum is how knowledge is conveyed and constructed Hence, several attempts were made to advance the recognition of Kaaps because the role of language is critically important in the successful delivery of the curriculum. Before learners can master a subject, they first need to overcome the barrier of the language of instruction. The result is that learners who speak Kaaps under-achieve in the national assessment tests because they are assessed in Standard Afrikaans. It should also be determined whether or not the new CAPS curriculum allows for Kaaps to be taught at school. According to the CAPS (DoBE 2012:4) the curriculum is an all inclusive document that guarantees learners the right to knowledge, skills and values irrespective of their socioeconomic background At the same time schools must be sensitive to issues such as diversity, language and race. The whole approach of CAPS is based on social transformation and human rights whilst teaching learners to appreciate our indigenous knowledge systems. Within this context it is clear that there is nothing that prohibits schools from acknowledging Kaaps in the curriculum. It is widely recognized that learning through the mother tongue is the most effective form of learning with the best results (Alexander 1997, Heugh 2006). If this is true for English, Afrikaans, isMosa and all the other indigenous languages, the same argument holds true for Kaaps. It is against this background that this study calls for a better representation of Kaaps in the school curriculum."
Business, Finance	This study investigates how accrual accounting is used in a system in which it co-exists with cash accounting. It uses a survey methodology to explore the factors that influence the extent to which accrual information is useful for decision making, when used in a dual system. The results show that although accrual information was used less for budgeting, evaluation, asset management or debt management, officials found accrual information useful for performance management. Moreover, neither experience nor leadership significantly contributed to decision-making effectiveness. The study also found that the central government was the most influential promoter of accrual accounting in Japan. Of particular interest is the link between performance measurement and accrual information.
Urban Studies	"Smartphone has become a desired product and even a necessity for more and more workers. This manuscript first proposes a framework for the effects of smartphone use on travel based on existing studies and anecdotal evidence. It then hypothesizes that usage of smartphone can increase the tolerance (or in other words, increase perceived benefits or positive utility of travel time) of a long trip (one type of ""productivity effect"" as per the above framework). It undertakes a survey of local residents in Beijing (valid sample n = 271) to validate the above hypothesis. Based on an ordered probit model, it examines whether and how the tolerance varies by factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, personal preference, and smartphone usage pattern. Its main findings are that: (a) smartphone usage significantly increases the tolerance of travel time; (b) the above tolerance varies across residents of different ages, preference, and employment statuses; (c) the tolerance is correlated to whether residents value the jobs-housing proximity; (d) younger, unemployed, or low-income smartphone users bear on average longer travel time than other users; (e) railway transit riders tend to see fewer productivity effects as compared to riders of other transit modes (e.g., regular bus). The findings indicate that the emergence of smartphone has some potential to ameliorate the situations of increased travel time, traffic congestion, and jobs-housing separation and to increase perceived benefits of travel time among some residents. This potential, nevertheless, is moderated by other factors such as preference, age, mode of travel, and employment status. Policy analysts and scholars need to probe further into the above tolerance and its influencing factors so as to take fuller advantage of the productivity effect of smart phones."
History & Philosophy Of Science	This paper examines how coherence of the contents of evidence affects the transmission of probabilistic support from the evidence to the hypothesis. It is argued that coherence of the contents in the sense of the ratio of the positive intersection reduces the transmission of probabilistic support, though this negative impact of coherence may be offset by other aspects of the relations among the contents. It is argued further that there is no broader conception of coherence whose impact on the transmission of probabilistic support is never offset by other aspects of the relations among the contents. The paper also examines reasons for the contrary impression that coherence of the contents increases the transmission of probabilistic support, especially in the special case where the hypothesis to evaluate is the conjunction of the contents of evidence.
Anthropology	This paper explores the failure of anthropology, at least since the 1970s, to look at the big picture: what the four fields can contribute to each other. It focuses on kinship as a key example, on other aspects of sociality, and on language and symbolic thought. I argue that an understanding of humanity as a whole, and especially hunter-gatherers, is important for grasping the nature of the human species. Cultural or social anthropology progressed to a large extent through kinship studies, and it is here also that we should look. The transformation of a Ju/'hoan kinship structure to a Khoe one is used as one key example. The deeper history of language itself is another. After these examples, I return to general issues, including the ways in which the diverse branches of anthropology, especially social anthropology and linguistic anthropology, serve to enlighten each other.
Management	Open innovation is an emergent paradigm by which organisations make use of their internal and external resources to perform their innovation processes. The growth of information and communication technologies has facilitated the spread of online open innovation communities, where users can share ideas as well as comment on and evaluate ideas posted by other community members. In this work, the behaviour of community members is analysed from the perspective of social network analysis. The final aim is twofold: first, to measure to what extent the different forms of participation are correlated to each other; and, second, how the collective intelligence evaluation schemes can be useful to identify those users posting ideas which are potentially applicable for the organisation. Obtained results can help community managers and organisations to improve the efficiency of the evaluation process when hundreds or thousands of ideas are shared through the online community.
Ethics	"The production of renewable energy in agricultural biogas plants is being widely criticized because-among other things-most of the feedstock comes from purpose-grown crops like maize. These activities (generously subsidized in the Czech Republic) generate competitive pressure to other crops that are used for feeding or food production, worsening their affordability. Unique pretreatment technology that allows substitution of the purpose-grown crops by farming residues (such as husk or straw) was built 6 years ago on a commercial basis in Pin (Czech Republic) under modest funding and without publicity. The design of the concept; financial assessment and moral viewpoint were analyzed based on practical operating data. It showed that the apparatus improves economic, environmental and moral acceptance as well. However, according to the government's view, public funding for this type of processing was shortened, ""because waste materials represent a lower cost"". The impact of such governance was analyzed as well."
International Relations	"From 1978 to roughly 1990, China focused on bringing in foreign direct investment. After 1990 it began going out in earnest as part of its new diplomacy. Between 1990 and 2005, China""s outbound investment was concentrated in the developing world. Since 2005, China has expanded its overseas investment to the developed world, and in recent years such activities have accelerated. This qualitative transformation of China""s global business expansion is taking place as China is poised to overtake the United States to become the world""s largest economy. What explains China""s new wave of global investment? How will it affect international political economy? What challenges do China""s businesses face in the West? Through empirical analysis, this study examines the rationale, strategies, and impact of China""s growing investment in the West. KEYWORDS: going global, outward direct investment (ODI), China""s relations with the West, new diplomacy, international political economy, international order."
Substance Abuse	AIMS - This article highlights ethical and clinical dilemmas of incarceration of pregnant drug addicts mandated by 10-3 of the Norwegian Municipal Health and Care Services act. MATERIAL - The material consists of two cases, Siri and Anna, and the ethical dilemmas posed by the use of 10-3 in these cases. METHODS -Semi-structured in-depth individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed word for word. Transcripts were coded according to converging interests and possible ethical dilemmas and described in a case format. The practical and experiential consequences of the law are discussed in relation to the four main bioethical principles: respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and social justice. These are supplemented by the principles of relational ethics. RESULTS - The application of 10-3 may lead to situations which distort the psychological preparation for parenthood and strains the helping relationship. The four principles approach seems to be an insufficient tool in grasping the complexity of the situation. CONCLUSIONS - Interventions to protect the foetus from the pregnant woman's use of substances demand elevated professional awareness of ethical and relational challenges and dilemmas. Relational ethics provides a framework to enhance reflexivity and a trusting therapeutic alliance. The potential for psychological change during pregnancy should be invested in. Hence, we suggest that during incarceration according to 10-3, foetal protection and the promotion of parental competences should be given equal priority.
Education & Educational Research	Across a wide variety of disciplines, coaching has become the universal practice for improving the professional performance of individuals and, consequently, the effectiveness of their organizations. Despite these shared outcomes, the coaching of individuals such as executives, athletes, and teachers features a variety of approaches, each with its own set of unique coaching elements. The literature in the respective fields has struggled to keep pace investigating the efficacy of these approaches and the relative impact of their elements. Programmatic research on coaching is further challenged by a paucity of conceptual frameworks. To address this challenge, we examined the coaching literature in the fields of education, sports, and business, highlighting a complimentary array of coaching purposes, elements, and processes. Based on this literature, we propose a new framework to specifically advance instructional coaching in the field of education. The content-neutral framework identifies 3 key dimensions of instructional coaching that can situate task- and subject-specific coaching models. Directions for the development of conceptual models and programmatic research are discussed.
History Of Social Sciences	We consider Scottish landscape gardener J.C. Loudon's already well-documented 1829 plan for a system of successive green belts around London. Our perspective will be that of transport planning, given his recommendations on street layout and public transport provision. Our contention is that Loudon's design for the Metropolis would have been theoretically inoperative if it had not been for its transport network. Beside other forward-thinking aspects already demonstrated by researchers, Loudon's plan is remarkable for setting out a design for an integrated Metropolis based on road planning and the then barely nascent technology of railways.
History	This contribution presents the relationship between the totalitarian communist regime and all individual Intellectual through the case of Lavo Cermelj, the political leader of the Slovene population of Primorska. As a representative of the Slovene minority in Triest, Cermelj took part in the struggle for minority rights within the liberal movement and continued to support this cause after his emigration to Yugoslavia. Even then, lie would consistently reject all totalitarian ideologies. His political conviction was formed during his youth and he would only cooperate with other political groups on the grounds of their common interests. If there was some gain to be anticipated for the national rights of the Slovene population under the Italian dominion, lie did not hesitate to cooperate. When individuals make a decision to join a totalitarian regime or agree to cooperate with one, the crucial question is whether this satisfies their basic political ideas. Between the two confronting, sides in the Slovene civil war, Cermelj tool, the side of the Slovene National Liberation Front (OF) led by the communists, as lie believed that their victory would provide a better chance for Slovenes in Primorska to gain some national rights and that if would help to achieve a more agreeable course of the border with Italy. In spite of his cooperation with OF, the representatives of the new regime regarded him with distrust and maintained an ambivalent relationship with hint. On one hand, he was under the Constant control of the security agency. Political authorities considered him undesirable and treated him as a pre-war bourgeois liberal and thus the enemy of the communist regime. That is why the archives of the security agency contain a number of reports about the political impropriety and incorrectness of Lavo Cermelj. On the other hand, he performed important expert work in the field of international law and protection of minority rights for the post-war authorities. Owing to his large public reputation. he was never pursued judicially or extrajudicially, nevertheless, he was never given an opportunity to work freely as a journalist and to influence the general public or the implementation of policy. The article emphasizes that the Yugoslav totalitarian regime tolerated the activity of non-supporting intellectuals, but only up to a certain point. The intellectuals themselves consented to such limited cooperation. Eventually, Cermelj was eliminated by the regime, but in a political rather than in a physical manner.
Cultural Studies	This short paper acts as a comment on Totaro and Ninno's The Concept of Algorithm as an Interpretative Key of Modern Rationality' and also introduces some new avenues for exploring the organization of algorithms. In recent discussion of algorithms, concerns have been expressed regarding the apparent power, agential capacity and control that algorithms command of our lives (Beer, 2009; Lash, 2007; Slavin, 2011; Spring, 2011; Stalder and Mayer, 2009). The logic of order, if there is one within these discussions, appears somewhat distinct from the metaphor of recursion suggested by Totaro and Ninno. Using this distinction as a starting point, the paper explores alternative metaphors from which to begin an engagement with political questions of algorithmic ordering. The paper argues for engaging with associative metaphors of: algorithmic account, fluidity, absent-presence and sociality. The paper explores these associative metaphors through an important set of emerging questions regarding organizing algorithms: who and what is included or excluded, on what terms and to what ends?
Geography	Given the challenge presented by worsening racial and religious relations in many western countries around the world, a closer look at the interplay between racist attitudes among potential perpetrators and experiences of racism among likely targets, focusing on out-group status, can better inform the dynamics of culturally diverse societies. Melbourne, Australia is ideal for such an analysis given its highly diverse population. Building on recent scholarship detailing a new approach to examining the attitude experience relationship, we add an important spatial dimension by investigating how patterns of association vary spatially within specific localities over and above citywide effects. Findings indicate significant associations between racist attitudes and experience of discrimination at the citywide and, in distinct ways, at the local (Local Government Area) level. Such relationships are shaped by socio-demographic and ethnic diversity profiles, embodying attribution and degree of out-group status, in complex and nuanced ways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethics	This study considered the range of ethical issues and potential stakeholder priorities associated with the application of genomic technologies applied to animal production systems, in particular those which utilised genomic technologies in accelerated breeding rather than the application of genetic modification. A literature review was used to inform the development of an ethical matrix, which was used to scope the potential perspectives of different agents regarding the acceptability of genomic technologies, as opposed to genetic modification (GM) techniques applied to animal production systems. There are very few studies carried out on stakeholder (including consumer) attitudes regarding the application of genomics to animal production in the human food chain and it may be that this technology is perceived as no more than an extension of traditional breeding techniques. While this is an area which needs more research, it would appear from this study that genomics, because it avoids many of the disadvantages and consumer perceptions associated with GM, is likely to prove a more publicly acceptable route than is GM for the development of healthier and more productive animals. However, stakeholders also need to have an approach to the moral status of the animals involved that finds credibility and acceptability with civil society.
Transportation	Seafarer health and well-being has long been a concern in the shipping industry because of the unique characteristics of working at sea. This paper aims to identify the role of burnout in seafarer health and well-being and its effect on safety. In particular, we differentiated seafarer burnout into personal and work-related burnout to reflect the ambiguous distinction between rest and work in seafarers' job environment. We also investigate the effectiveness of emotion regulation for seafarers to reduce burnout. This study proposes a conceptual framework to identify the causal relationship between occupational stress, sleepiness, emotion regulation, burnout, and incidents at sea. To verify the proposed framework, scales were adapted from established scales in the literature; a cross-sectional survey was also conducted to collect empirical data for analysis with path and simultaneous equation models. The analysis results revealed that personal and work-related burnout in seafarers are mutually affected; however, only work-related burnout exerts a direct effect on incidents. Reappraisal is an effective emotion regulation strategy in seafarers to reduce personal burnout, but not work-related burnout. Occupational stress and sleepiness exert positive effects on both personal and work-related burnout; yet, their effect on incidents is mediated by work-related burnout.
Nursing	Although care coordination is a popular intervention, there is no standard method of delivery. Also little is known about who benefits most, or characteristics that predict the amount of care coordination needed, especially with chronically ill older adults. The purpose of this study was to identify types and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to 231 chronically ill older adults who participated in a 12-month home care medication management program in the Midwest. For each participant, the nurse care coordinator spent an average of 134 min/mo providing in-person home care, 48min/mo of travel, and 18min/mo of indirect care occurring outside the home visit. This accounted for 67.2%, 23.8%, and 9.0% of nursing time, respectively, for home visits, travel, and indirect care. Four of 11 nursing interventions focused on medication management were provided to all participants. Seven of the 11 main interventions were individualized according to each person's special needs. Wide variations were observed in time provided with in-person home care and communications with multiple stakeholders. Study findings indicate the importance of individualizing interventions and the variability in the amount of nursing time needed to provide care coordination to chronically ill older adults.
Business, Finance	We develop a weighted-average approach of pricing under model uncertainty, where several plausible models are considered instead of a perfect one. The model uncertainty effect from this weighted-average approach is significantly different from the conventional wisdom, in which the true price must be bounded by prices in all plausible models. We identify under what circumstances the model uncertainty effect is significant and reveal serious risk management challenges for researchers, regulators, and market participants.
Ethics	In this paper I focus on the Hungarian intellectual and politician Paul Szende's sociologically oriented epistemology. I trace the influences of physiology, psychology, economy, evolutionary theory of his day on his sociological theory of abstractive knowledge, and discuss the close connection between physiological, social, and economic aspects in the early sociology of knowledge. My discussion continues with an examination of Szende's differentiation between two economic effects within social epistemology: on the one hand the 'economy of thought' in the tradition of Ernst Mach, with its physiological, organic, and integrative functioning of knowledge; on the other hand, the socio-economic effects of social selection, exclusion, and societal antagonism. Besides the Marxist and more specifically the Austro-Marxist environment of Szende's writings, I trace the influence of the economic theory of Italian economist Achille Loria on Szende's understanding of the antagonistic nature of the transformation of knowledge. The paper is set at the intersection of philosophy of science and history of science. It relates epistemological issues to historical, social, and scientific developments in Szende's day and thus combines a philosophical analysis of Szende's sociological theory of knowledge with historical research into the natural, social, and economic sciences of his time.
Public Administration	This study uses organizational theory to explore why nonprofit organizations conduct evaluations and how they use evaluation information. According to rational choice theory, managers of nonprofit organizations will conduct evaluations to make sure they are making good decisions about how to improve their services and achieve their goals. Yet, according to data gathered about the experiences of 31 nonprofit organizations, this assumption about the evaluation practices of nonprofits rarely holds true. Rather, other organizational theories, such as agency theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, and stewardship theory, which make different assumptions about how organizations operate and how managers behave, provide a more accurate description of why nonprofits engage in evaluation and how they use evaluation information. The findings from this study are important because they help to identify strategies that would encourage nonprofit organizations to use evaluation in more productive and meaningful ways.
History Of Social Sciences	The importance of instrument firms in the development of psychology, and science in general, should not be underestimated since it would not have been possible for various leading psychologists at the turn of the twentieth century to conduct certain experiments without the assistance of instrument makers, as is often the case today. To illustrate the historical perspective introduced here, the example of Alfred Binet is taken, as he is an interesting case of a psychologist working in close collaboration with various French instrument designers of the time. The objective of this article is twofold: (1) to show the considerable activity carried out by early psychologists to finalize new laboratory instruments in order to develop their research projects; (2) to reassess the work of a major figure in French psychology through his activity as a designer of precision instruments. The development of these new instruments would certainly have been difficult without the presence in Paris of numerous precision instrument manufacturers such as Charles Verdin, Otto Lund, Henri Collin, and Lucien Korsten, on whom Binet successively called in order to develop his projects in the field of experimental psychology.

Urban Studies	The concept of accessibility has been widely employed to understand the jobs-housing relationship in US cities. However, relevant studies in Chinese cities are rare. Little attention has been paid to accessibility modelling, variations among population groups, and the influence of land use arrangement and transport infrastructure in Chinese cities. To address this deficiency, the present paper provides measures on the job accessibility of workers with different hukou status in Guangzhou. The study yields the following findings: 1) inner-city districts have better job accessibility compared to suburban areas; 2) local hukou workers have significantly higher job accessibility than non-local hukou workers; 3) job suburbanization seems not to be effective in improving job accessibility or narrowing the gap between local and non-local hukou workers; and 4) investment in public transport would significantly improve the mobility and job accessibility of non-local hukou workers and help to alleviate accessibility inequality.
Management	This paper examines the effects of employer social responsibility on the wages workers demand through randomized field experiments in two online labor marketplaces. Workers were recruited for short-term jobs and I manipulated whether or not they received information about the employer's social responsibility. I then observed the payment workers were willing to accept for the job. In the first experiment, information about the employer's social responsibility marginally reduced prospective workers' wage requirements on average and had a significant effect on the highest performers, who were willing to give up the wage differential they would otherwise demand. In the second, prospective workers submitted 44% lower wage bids for the same job after learning about the employer's social responsibility. This paper provides causal empirical evidence of a revealed preference for social responsibility in the workplace, and of a greater preference among the highest performers. More broadly, it provides evidence that workers value purpose and meaningfulness at work, and it demonstrates that workers are willing to give up pecuniary benefits for nonpecuniary benefits. It furthermore highlights heterogeneity in worker preferences for nonpecuniary benefits by worker performance type.
Health Policy & Services	Objective To test whether physicians' provision of charity care depends on their hourly wage. Data Sources Secondary data from four rounds of the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey (1996-2005). Data are nationally representative of nonfederal office- and hospital-based physicians spending at least 20 hours per week on patient care. Study Design A two-part model with site-level fixed effects, time trend variables, and site-year interactions is used to model the relationship between physicians' hourly wage and both their decision to provide any charity care and the amount of charity care provided. Salaried and nonsalaried physicians are modeled separately. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Data from each round of the CTS were merged into a single cross-sectional file with 38,087 physician-year observations. Principal Findings The association between physician's hourly wage and the likelihood of providing charity care is positive for salaried physicians and negative for nonsalaried physicians. Among physicians providing any charity care, hourly wage is positively associated with the amount of charity care provided regardless of salaried status. Practice characteristics are also significant. Conclusions The financial considerations of salaried physicians differ significantly from those of nonsalaried physicians in the decision to provide charity care, but factor similarly into the amount of charity care provided.
Industrial Relations & Labor	In 1983, Airlie Hochschild published a 'classic', The Managed Heart. Since this publication, scores of articles have been produced to explore the various manifestations of emotional labour across a range of service industries. However, there is little research on emotional labour when the face-to-face or voice-to-voice interactions with customers are not obviously apparent. This article presents data collected from a food processing plant that has seen a strong managerial attempt to develop a unitarist culture. Employees face a significant level of emotional labour in their interactions within this culture. As has been found in the service industry literature, employees react differently to the emotional labour that they face, and indeed, not all emotional labour is negative for employees.
Business, Finance	Using the market-to-book assets (MB) ratio and its inverse exponential transformation as proxies for growth options, we find that the growth options effect on leverage is negative and highly convex in China, consistent with the U.S. evidence from Ogden and Wu (2013). Of particular importance, using a nonlinear transformed rather than a linear MB ratio yields stronger explanatory power for the growth options effect on leverage in tests of both static and dynamic trade-off theories. Moreover, we show that the growth options effect on leverage is stronger among firms characterized by wider divergence between control rights and cash-flow rights of the largest ultimate owner and firms that face more severe financial constraints.

Rehabilitation	Purpose: Self-management has become an important concept in stroke rehabilitation. This study explored allied healthcare professionals' (AHPs) perceptions and beliefs regarding the self-management of stroke survivors and their knowledge and skills regarding stroke self-management interventions. Method: Four focus group interviews were conducted with 27 professionals. Verbal questions and mind mapping were used to collect data. A constant comparative framework was used for analysis. Results: The AHPs discussed different levels of post-stroke self-management, depending on factors such as pre-stroke skills, recovery-phases post-stroke and cognitive abilities of the stroke patients. They hesitated about stroke clients' capacities to self-manage. AHPs questioned whether their own attitudes and skills were really supportive for stroke clients' self-management and criticised stroke services as being too medically oriented. They recommended that self-management programmes should focus both on clients and caregivers and be delivered at peoples' homes. Conclusion: Professional perceptions and beliefs are important factors to take into account when implementing stroke self-management programmes. Before professionals can enable stroke survivors to self-manage, they first need support in acquiring knowledge and skills regarding post-stroke self-management. Moreover, professionals could benefit from behavioural change models, and professionals recognised that stroke self-management interventions would be most beneficial when delivered post-discharge at people's homes.
Education & Educational Research	Irish science education is aiming to develop post-primary students' knowledge of and about science through the introduction of 'nature of science' (NOS) in the new junior cycle science specification. This study aimed to investigate pre-service science teachers' views about a particular aspect of NOS, namely the aims and values of science. Aims and values in relation to science can be considered from epistemic, cognitive, cultural, social, political, moral and ethical perspectives. In this paper, we focus on the epistemic, cognitive and social aims and values of science to provide a broad overview and investigate pre-service science teachers' understanding of them. Qualitative methods are used to highlight two case studies that provide an in-depth record of how pre-service science teachers interpret aims and values of science. Although the sample is limited in terms of its generalisability to pre-service teacher education at large, the study provides a framework for (a) what to target and investigate about NOS in science education, particularly about aims and values of science, and (b) how pre-service science teachers are likely to make sense of such relatively new curricular goals. Implications for pre-service science teacher education are discussed.
Cultural Studies	This article explores the influence of social engineering in various forms within Swedish cultural policy, seen in a historical perspective. In social engineering cultural policy measures, reforms and projects are justified by scientifically based research rather than party based ideological arguments. Karl Popper's classification of the utopian and the step-by-step engineering make up the starting point, redefined as paternalistic engineering, welfare state engineering and utilitarian engineering in order to apply these ideas to cultural policy. Social engineering was predominant in Swedish cultural policy mainly during the post war period. In the 1950s as well as in the 1970s this engineering takes on a paternalistic character, in the struggle against injurious culture, such as video violence. Current practice of paternalistic engineering is directed at revealing and identifying invisibles structures in the field of cultural heritage. The welfare state engineering had its highlights in the planning era of the 1960s and the 1970s, and today culture as a beneficial factor for both citizens and society is labelled utilitarian engineering.
Communication	Starting in 2008, debate about potential hazardous effects from exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) migrated from the pages of scientific journals to the U.S. media, regulatory authorities, and state legislatures. In the context of deep scientific conflict about the existence of adverse health effects attributable to BPA, this article asks why it was the case that some state legislatures considered or adopted legislative bans on products made from BPA, whereas others did not. Drawing on existing theories of agenda-setting and policy change via punctuated equilibrium as well as a well-defined methodology (event history analysis), evidence of agenda-setting is presented. Particularly, it is argued that routine and high-impact health coverage was significantly related to the chance that a state legislature considered legislation banning products made with BPA. This was indirectly, but importantly, related to the actual adoption by state legislatures of legislative bans on products made with BPA.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	One of the mundane everyday practices of IVF is observing and classifying embryos. After the fertilisation, embryos are graded according to their quality which is an estimation of whether the embryogenesis-the embryo's development-seems normal or deviant. This practice is called embryo selection and it is based on assessing the 'good quality' embryos as viable and 'poor quality' ones as inviable. Viability refers to the capacity of embryos to develop into foetuses and eventually become babies. However, the question of what kinds of embryos ultimately are viable is a complex issue, which also hinges upon several other factors than the quality estimation. This paper shows that the idea of embryo viability is an assemblage of multiple kinds of things. The paper is based on multi-sited ethnography and expert and patient interviews conducted in the private fertility service sector of Finland. I argue that embryo viability is a practical achievement that requires the successful combination of several factors: the scientific facts on embryo quality, the expert knowledge and laboratory practices and the patients' engagements in the process. None of these factors alone is enough to explain the precarious embryo viability which nevertheless is the central issue in IVF.
Industrial Relations & Labor	The share of minorities and women comprising high-paying skilled occupations such as management, professional, and technical occupations has been increasing since the 1960s, while the proportion of white men in such occupations has been declining. What has been the contribution of affirmative action to the occupational advancement of minorities and women from low-wage unskilled occupations into high-wage skilled ones in U.S. firms? I examine this by comparing the occupational position of minorities and women at firms holding federal contracts, and thereby mandated to implement affirmative action, and noncontracting firms, over the course of 31 years during 19732003. I use a new longitudinal dataset of over 100,000 large private-sector firms across all industries and regions uniquely suited for the exploration of this question obtained from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. My key findings show that the share of minorities and women in high-paying skilled occupations grew more at federal contractors subject to affirmative action obligation than at noncontracting firms during the three decades under study, but these advances took place primarily during the pre- and early Reagan years and during the decade following the Glass Ceiling Act of 1991.
Anthropology	Well-stratified Middle Palaeolithic assemblages are extremely rare in Mongolia. Initially investigated between the 1960s and 1990s, three major Middle Palaeolithic sites in the Orkhon Valley of central Mongolia yielded a large quantity of data and generated many research questions that still await answers. Re-investigation of these sites has uncovered chronostratigraphic and cultural sequences that may shed new light on human dispersal routes.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This work addressed critical questions related to the optimization of all-important slot revenues, as they are critical to the success of most of the world's casinos. Using data collected from a live gaming floor, the obfuscated pars of otherwise identical reel slot machines were manipulated to determine whether differences in game-level performance and/or player detection would occur. The results indicated significant and substantial increases in revenue for the high-par games, with no clear signs of play migration toward their paired low-par counterparts. These results were produced in spite of the clear disincentive to play the high-par games. This work extended the extant literature by increasing the time to discover the difference in pars to a full year, and by expanding the difference in the pars of the paired games. Additionally, this was the first study to examine the impacts of par differences on actual casino win.
International Relations	The Philippines Arbitration Tribunal separately dealing with the jurisdiction over the South China Sea dispute is the continuance of the set practice by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea's Annex VII arbitral tribunals of bifurcation of proceedings, and was the best option for it to deal with China's objections to its jurisdiction in the circumstance of China's nonacceptance of and non-participation in the arbitral proceedings. Such a measure has potentially important implications for the tribunal itself and for China. The tribunal's decision to have jurisdiction over some parts of the Philippines' submissions resumed the merits proceedings of the dispute. This development of the proceedings would force China to reconsider its current policy of non-participation. Participation in the subsequent merits proceedings might be the right choice for China.
Geography	"Analyzing temporal changes in forest amount and configuration is paramount to better design future forest management interventions. Such analyses are especially required for tropical biomes, which are usually subject to dynamic and heterogeneous land uses. Recent studies have suggested that many tropical biomes are passing through the process of forest transition, i.e. an overall change from forest loss to forest gain. However, this hypothesis remains scarcely tested, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed, quantitative historical records of forest cover. In this study, we investigate 38 years of land use change in Brazil""s Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, from 1976 to 2014, using multitemporal datasets from aerial photographs and satellite images. We classified the historical series to produce land use maps and calculated a set of landscape metrics, including total forest cover, patch size, patch shape and patch connectivity. Our results indicated non-linear changes through time in forest loss and gain and also in landscape structure, which can be classified into two distinct periods. The first period (1976-1996) was marked by expressive forest loss and fragmentation, whereas the second (1996-2014) was characterized by a much less intense forest dynamics, with little deforestation being balanced by forest regeneration. We attribute the forest dynamics observed to temporal changes in socioeconomic factors, such as increasing human settlements and changes in environmental protection policies. Our results show that current forests are a heterogeneous mosaic of forests with different ages, and support the hypothesis that forest transition is occurring in Atlantic Forest landscapes.

Management	This study tests the prescience of John Mathews' linkage-leverage-learning (LLL) model to explain internationalization by latecomer firms (LFs)-set in an evolutionary backdrop. The hypothesis harbored in this study is that while LLL explains how LFs initially compete in international markets, it is autonomous learning, independent of LLL that is crucial to internationalization. We used panel data from 1994 to 2012 with 821 observations from 69 firms and performed multiple econometric analyses to test our hypotheses. Our results suggest that autonomous learning rather than resource leverage and learning through linkages with MNCs explain the success of Indian pharmaceutical LFs. LFs progress from being a recipient of knowledge in a global production network to a phase where they can become important contributors in the global innovation network. This study therefore demonstrates that LFs that invest in autonomous learning in addition to reaping advantages through their linkages with global innovators are the ones that are successful in their internationalization process and are able to become dominant players in the global market.
Economics	Background: Best-practice guidelines for stated-preference methods suggest there is a limit to the number of attributes respondents can reliably evaluate. This study explores a cost-effective solution to combining elicitation formats from a single study to obtain more preference information from a given sample while limiting respondents' cognitive burden. Methods: A stated-preference survey combined both discrete-choice experiment (DCE) and best-worst scaling (BWS) elicitation formats to Alzheimer's disease caregivers. DCE questions elicited attribute-level preferences for one subset of attributes, and object-case BWS elicited overall relative attribute importance for another subset of attributes, with two overlapping attributes in both designs. Two alternative joint models combined preferences from the BWS and DCE data. One model controlled for confounding between response-error variance and preference parameters in the DCE model, and the other did not. Results: About 400 caregivers completed the survey. We estimated attribute-level preference parameters for 17 attributes, 9 of which were directly estimated using the DCE data, and 8 of which were extrapolated based on the overall relative importance estimated using the object-case BWS data. Results from both joint models and individual models indicate that relative preferences from the two question formats were the same up to a scale factor. Conclusion: Our results suggest that combining DCE and object-case BWS is a cost-effective solution to the need for more information when study resources are limited. Moreover, for these data at least, researchers' concerns about serious confounding between DCE model estimates and response-error variance appear unwarranted. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Geography	"The extent of urban areas is rapidly expanding across the globe, both horizontally and vertically. While natural and social scientists have examined the impacts of this urbanisation on earth system and social processes, to date researchers have largely overlooked how in turn earth system processes can act on this urban fabric to produce hybrid landforms. Unique pseudokarst landforms are found within the urban fabric, including urban stalactites and urban sinkholes. Additionally, both the chronic and acute degradation of urban buildings can form rubble and dust that, if left in situ, will be shaped by fluvial and aeolian processes. For many of these urban geomorphological processes, the neglect or abandonment of parts of the urban network will facilitate or accelerate their influence. If there are economic, climatic or social reasons for abandonment or neglect, these processes are likely to reshape parts of the urban fabric into unique landforms at a range of scales. We contend that researchers need to explicitly consider the urban fabric as an Anthropocene landform and that by doing so important insights can be gained into urban hazards and geomorphological processes. Shelley's Ozymandias, in which the eponymous king failed to account for the effects of earth system processes acting on ""mighty"" urban structures over time, serves as an important reminder of the impermanence of our urban works and the need to recognise and understand the processes acting on them."
Family Studies	Recent Changes in the Post-Yugoslav Family: The Disappearance of the Last Extended Family in Europe The paper studies the contemporary development of family patterns in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Historically, these patterns varied considerably, from the extended family (zadruga, fir) present in Orthodox and Muslim regions, to the European conjugal family as typical of Western Europe in Slovenia. Current trends indicate a prevalence of modernization developments, despite the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the lack of a common state framework. The uniform pattern is even more clearly evinced in those countries where the extended family existed until the very dissolution of Yugoslavia (particularly Kosovo, where it seems the extended family has finally disappeared). Thus, a diminution in the average household size, in the average number of children born, is noted in all countries, particularly in those with previously high fertility rates. Finally, attitudes towards social roles within matrimony also indicate a convergence, towards favoring the parity of partners, in contrast to high variance on this issue during the existence of Yugoslavia, where traditionalistic attitudes prevailed, particularly in Kosovo and Macedonia. This finding does not lend support to the clash of civilizations thesis.
Social Work	Volunteer organizations can potentially partner with mainstream professional services to provide better parenting support to immigrant parents. This qualitative study of cooperation between professional agencies and volunteer organizations known as migrant volunteer and community organizations (MVCOs) aims to understand the extent to which professionals and volunteers can transform frame divergence from an obstacle into an advantage. Using frame analysis, this article explores the difficulties these groups encountered when they attempted to work together in two immigrant neighborhoods in Amsterdam. The divergence of the frames each group employed to define cooperation and its aims fueled mistrust and prevented attempts to work more closely together. The possibility of positively employing frame divergence to develop innovative solutions through frame reflection and reframing was hampered by the frame divergence itself, which was rooted in a long-standing controversy concerning roles, power relations, and patterns of inequality between the people involved.
Geography	Defining a model for the representation and the analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics remains an open domain in geographical information sciences. In this article we investigate a spatio-temporal graph-based model dedicated to managing and extracting sets of geographical entities related in space and time. The approach is based on spatial and temporal local relations between neighboring entities during consecutive times. The model allows us to extract sets of connected entities distant in time and space over long periods and large spaces. From GIS concepts and qualitative reasoning on space and time, we combine the graph model with a dedicated spatial database. It includes information on geometry and geomorphometric parameters, and on spatial and temporal relations. This allows us to extend classical measurements of spatial parameters, with comparisons of entities linked by complex relations in space and time. As a case study, we show how the model suggests an efficient representation of dunes dynamics on a nautical chart for safe navigation.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Until now, little research has been conducted to analyse Twitter conversations about the corporate sponsors of football clubs. The conventional and most widely used method has been to use content analysis to assess the sentiment of the tweets that were sent. However, this approach may be inadequate because sports fans may be unlikely to mention a corporate sponsor in the text they tweet. This study demonstrates the use of visual analytics to assess conversations about corporate sponsors by examining the images people tweet.
History	"Since the 1980s, several aspects of masculinity in relation to the First World War, including the image of the citizen-soldier, have been well studied. Other aspects, however, such as the experience of combat and its impact on peacetime masculinities lag well behind. Though wartime and postwar experiences in Africa provide a repertoire for gender and masculinity research, the continent has been neglected in this realm of studies. British colonial Nigeria contributed tens of thousands of combat men to the war with thousands becoming disabled and facing challenges to their masculine identities, yet there is no serious research on this topic for Nigeria. This paper contributes to this long-neglected aspect of African history. Known in colonial archival documents only as amputated men, war-disabled Nigerian men struggled to navigate colonial bureaucracy in order to obtain artificial limbs and redeem what they considered their lost manhood. Employing data collected from the Nigerian and British archives, the article""s objectives are twofold: it analyzes the diminishment of the masculine identities of war-disabled men in Nigeria following the First World War, and it explains how such diminishment was accentuated by an inefficiently structured British colonial bureaucracy, paired with British colonial racism. The article contributes to scholarship on WWI, disability studies, gender studies, and colonial studies, through examination of the protracted legacies of the global conflict on the African continent."
Management	The combination of two trends common in working life - international work and a dual career situation - is challenging for both genders. In order to cope with the situation, international dual career couples have to be able to coordinate their careers. The purpose of this article is to identify how dual career expatriates view their career coordination strategies with their partners, and how these views differ between the genders. Semi-structured interviews were carried out among 39 expatriates on assignment who had a partner working, at least before the assignment. Our findings identify three career coordination strategies applied by dual career couples, and confirm gender plays an essential role in the formation of those strategies. Male expatriates predominated among the group adopting a hierarchical strategy and female expatriates predominated among the group adopting an egalitarian and a loose coordination strategy. Strategies also seemed prone to change over time. Companies should pay attention to both the career development of the partner and the relationship coping skills of the couple to maximize the chances of dual career expatriate assignments being successful.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Experimental vaccines to treat smoking are tested in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) where participants receive real or placebo 'nicotine vaccination' plus additional support. RCTs are a standard method within the current conventions of evidence-based medicine. As yet, nicotine vaccines did not 'work' better than placebos. Interestingly, several trials showed high overall quit smoking rates. Understanding lifestyle change, scholars argue, requires insights into sociocultural context and embodied experiences. The question then arises how knowledge claims about behaviour change are made in the controlled setting of a clinical trial. Drawing from science and workplace studies, this paper analyses the case of a nicotine vaccination trial. With document analysis, fieldwork and 77 interviews we compared the daily practice of fact-making with the knowledge claims as represented front stage. Our qualitative study suggests that staff and volunteers performed much work in attending to social processes of behaviour change and trial participation. These efforts were underrepresented in the protocol-centred format of trial reports. The knowledge work of assistants in particular was largely absent in official documents. Accounting for experiments with nicotine and other lifestyle vaccines will require an integrative trial design that combines the biomedical rationale with perspectives from the humanities and social sciences.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The main aim of the study was to design an appropriate motor skills development programme that could be implemented in any primary school to improve the fundamental motor skills (FMS) of children between the ages of 9 and 12 years old. One previously disadvantaged (Quintile 2) school in the Stellenbosch region was selected to participate in the study. The children (N=67) were conveniently selected to participate in the study and were divided into an experimental (n=35) and a control group (n=32). Only the experimental group participated in the motor skill development programme for 12 weeks. No significant differences were found for the mean balance score within the experimental and the control group or between the pre- and post-test. However, there were significant differences found for the mean bilateral coordination scores between the pre- and post-test of the experimental group but not with the control group. This could be attributed to the 12-week intervention programme presented to the experimental group. It is suggested that this programme may be beneficial to all primary school children, not only those from previously disadvantaged schools.
Business, Finance	We examine what determines executive compensation in privately held firms. Our study is motivated by the fact that most studies in this area rely on data from publicly traded firms. Further, the few studies that are based on data from privately held firms only examine a limited number of determinants of executive compensation. Our findings indicate that the pay-to-performance relation is weak. Board size and ownership concentration are the only corporate governance characteristics that explain variations in executive compensation. Executive characteristics like skills, title and educational attainment all explain variations in executive compensation. Contrary to our expectations, we do not find a stronger pay-to-performance relation in firms with better designed bonus plans.
Cultural Studies	The publication of Steven Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature popularized an emerging orthodoxy in political and social science - that is, that violence and warfare have been declining over the past century, particularly since the end of the Second World War. Invoking the scientific and political neutrality of their data and evidence, Pinker and other declinists' insist that powerful, liberal democratic states have subdued humans' evolutionary disposition to violence. This article analyses the heuristic validity and political framework of these claims. The article examines, in particular, the declinists' interpretation and use of demographic, archaeological, anthropological and historical evidence. The article argues that the declinists' arguments are embedded in a utopian liberalism that has its own deep roots in the cultural volition' and history of human violence. The article concludes that the declinists have either misunderstood or misrepresented the evidence in order to promote their own neoliberal political interests and ideologies.
History Of Social Sciences	Looking at the South Korean case of New Songdo City and comparing it with two Chinese cities, the Yujiapu Financial District and Lingang New City, this study examines practices of city building in Northeast Asia not simply from an ambitious urban design aspect, but more critically from the planning patterns and emphatic discourses employed in these developments. Designed by top-down decisions to reach the ocean coast from the centres of the metropolitan region, New Songdo City drew upon the Global City paradigm that employs comprehensive modernist urban plans, while city developers aspired it to be a strategically positioned, new urban gate to its metropolitan region. Similar ambitions feed the creation of Yujiapu and Lingang and are coloured by a competitive developmental agenda of catching up the West on the one hand and surpassing regional rival cities on the other hand. These South Korean and Chinese examples stand as emblematic instances of how the currency of global city development is now articulated through popular planning discourses like ecologically conscious and technologically advanced urbanism. Framed as Green City Development, the three new cities reveal narrowly tailored global themes of sustainability and intelligence that address the current modes of imagining urban space in Northeast Asia.
Cultural Studies	It was arguably easier in the past to pin down media production in medium- or content-specific locales, such as the studio, the newsroom or the set. Contemporary processes of media convergence have dramatically opened up the what' and where' of media production to include all manner of quotidian practices and ephemeral places. This special issue, however, pushes back against the idea that contemporary landscapes of media production have been flattened. Each of the articles collected here accounts for significant transformations in media practices near to those that we would conventionally associate with media production, yet which are also potentially left behind in the rush to describe, theorize, celebrate and critique trends such as produsage', prosumption' and participatory media culture. Taken together, the articles in this special issue provide new insights into the locations and relocations of contemporary media production across new and under-researched liminal and peripheral geographies, and around new and unexpected objects.
Economics	"This article investigates whether and how Asian people""s exposure to a variety of disasters undermine their decisions and welfare. Our case study from Vietnam, based on household panel data, shows that households adopt a variety of coping strategies against the damages caused by disasters especially through credit and labor markets. While the consumption risk sharing networks function effectively at the commune level, market and non-market insurance mechanisms are not sufficient, especially at the regional, national, and international levels. Hence, it is imperative to strengthen market, government, and community based insurance mechanisms to diversify aggregate disaster risks at the individual, national, and regional levels in Asia."
Public Administration	This research is intended to supplement comparative national studies, which represent a challenge to accounting history for the last decades, explaining the Romanian public accounting practices in their local and time-specific context, taking into question the case of the entities owned by the government. In essence, the findings show the materialization of accrual accounting benefits for Romania as an emerging economy in terms of all independent variables used in the study: fixed assets, liabilities, revenues and costs. The article also analyzes the gradual evolution of finding the advantages of the Romanian accounting system's transition from a cash basis to an accrual basis in the two analyzed stages, the transition and post-reform periods. It proves thus the correlation between the pace of regulatory changes and their application in practice, indirectly confirming the orientation of the Romanian standard-setters towards IPSAS and accrual accounting. Moreover, this research is an argument for the importance of accounting and of the economic analysis, which the study can support through proper financial reporting.
Women'S Studies	Korean immigrants rely heavily on their respective churches for assistance with domestic violence. Yet, Korean clergy's responses to domestic violence are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine factors that influence Korean clergy's responses to domestic violence in their congregations. Results showed that clergy's Korean cultural values, age, and length of residence in the United States influence their responses to domestic violence. Developing a collaborative working relationship between Korean clergy and domestic violence advocates, as well as providing training to Korean clergy targeting their knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, and skills is critical for promoting safety of battered Korean immigrant women.
Substance Abuse	Objective: Rates of alcohol dependence are elevated in women with eating disorders who engage in binge eating or compensatory behaviors compared with women with eating disorders who do not report binge eating or compensatory behaviors and with healthy controls. Alcohol dependence, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors are heritable; however, it is unclear whether a shared genetic liability contributes to the phenotypic association among these traits, and little information exists regarding this shared liability in men. We investigated genetic and environmental correlations among alcohol dependence, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors in male and female twins. Method: Participants included 5,993 same- and opposite-sex twins from the Australian Twin Registry who completed a modified version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism that assessed lifetime alcohol dependence and binge eating as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised. Compensatory behaviors were assessed via a general health questionnaire in women only. Biometrical twin models estimated genetic and environmental influences on alcohol dependence, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors. Results: In women, the multivariate twin model suggested that additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects influenced alcohol dependence, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors, with heritability estimates ranging from 38% to 53%. The best-fitting sex-limitation model was a common effects model that equated all genetic and nonshared environmental influences in men and women. The heritability estimates were 50% and 38% for alcohol dependence and binge eating, respectively. Overall, there were significant genetic correlations between alcohol dependence and binge eating, alcohol dependence and compensatory behaviors, and binge eating and compensatory behaviors. Conclusions: These findings indicate that common genetic factors may underlie the vulnerability to alcohol dependence and the liability to binge eating and compensatory behaviors.
Women'S Studies	Traditional western conceptions of pain have commonly associated pain with the inability to communicate and with the absence of the self. Thus pain, it seems, must be avoided, since it is to blame for alienating the body from subjectivity and the self from others. Recent work on pain, however, has began to challenge these assumptions, mainly by discerning between different kinds of pain and by pointing out how some forms of pain might even constitute a crucial element in the production of subjectivity. This article deals with the specific form of pain that is labour pain. Pain in labour has been investigated in medicine and lately, copiously, within the social sciences. Analyses from a more philosophical perspective are still very much missing, however, and in developing such analyses, de Beauvoir's ideas on subjectivity as inherently embodied, as situated, and as profoundly ambiguous when authentically lived, appear to be of significant use.
Area Studies	"This article argues that part of the reason why some Middle Eastern states remain democratically challenged is the emergence, operation, and political influence of ""security networks"" and ""deep states"" - informal actors in the area of national security. The article explains what these actors are, situates them in a broad theoretical and comparative perspective, assesses their impact on democratic development, and provides examples from Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt."
Geography	The spatial distribution pattern of the economic development among counties is an important external representation of a balanced and sustainable regional development in China. The natural topography has been regarded as one of the most important factors that controls the economic development of a county. Moreover, natural topography determines land availability and regional accessibility and further influences the objective environment of wealth creation. On the basis of the digital elevation model (DEM) data and geographic information science (GIS) spatial analysis method, this study utilizes the poverty-stricken counties in China to explore the influential factors of the spatial distribution of county's wealth by considering the natural topographic environment. The indexes of slope gradient, terrain relief, river length and river density are calculated to investigate the spatial relationship between the wealth distribution of counties and their natural topographic condition. Results show that the poverty-stricken counties in China are mainly located on the second Gradient Terrain of the Three Gradient Terrains in the country and are particularly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, Qinling-Daba Mountains, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. These areas are also located near both sides of the traditional Hu Huanyong Population Line of China. Results also show that the complex conditions of the natural topography have a positive driving effect on the spatial distribution of the poverty-stricken counties. By contrast, non-poverty-stricken counties are mainly located in areas with good topographic conditions. A total of 70% of the poverty-stricken counties are characterized by severe topographic condition with an average slope gradient of over 10 calculated from the 90 m cell size DEM. However, only 32% of the non-poverty-stricken counties are characterized by severe topographic condition. In addition, 72% of the poverty-stricken counties have an average terrain relief of over 50 m in a local 3 x 3 cell size (270 m x 270 m), whereas non-poverty-stricken counties accounted for only 34%. Furthermore, the scale effect of the topographical feature derivation from DEM makes the actual topographic condition of the poverty-stricken counties even worse, and the land should be considerably difficult to cultivate. Finally, the primary industry seems to experience difficulty in addressing poverty in poverty-stricken counties. The sheep-flock effect of government-led industries that enter the poverty-stricken counties is expected to be an important policy direction for a balanced regional development. This study provides a reference to the driving force of the natural topographic conditions on the wealth accumulation among counties for a balanced and sustainable regional development.
Social Work	This study utilized a multidimensional measure of social welfare composed of 26 social indicators integrated in nine categories: education, employment and social protection, income, health, housing conditions, subjective wellbeing, social capital, use of technology, and culture and leisure to help understand social welfare in Mexico. We also compared the integrated measure with the Human Development Index. Estimation was performed using the DP2 method. Our analysis indicated that the health and housing conditions categories contributed the most to social welfare across the 32 Mexican States. In relation to the indicators, income and trust in other people were associated with welfare. Further, results on the welfare ranking of Mexican states revealed variations between the two indices (DP2 and the HDI). Specifically, only four states occupied the same position on both indices, ten recorded different positions on DP2 moving up or down from their levels of social welfare. Implications of observed correlations are presented.
Nursing	Objective: This study assessed the prevalence of children's and adolescents pain experiences and use of medicine and examined the relationships between pain experiences, medication knowledge, literacy, and use of medicine. Method: A probability-proportionate-to-size sampling method was used to systematically draw a random sample of schools. In 2014, a national representative sample of 2309 students from 35 primary schools (5th-6th grade), 2700 students from 30 middle schools, and 2013 students from 20 high schools completed the online survey. Results: Overall, 85.6% of children and adolescents reported experiencing pain during the past year that included headache (63.0%), throat ache (59.3%), muscle ache (58.3%), stomach pain (42.9%), menstrual pain (girls: 42.1%), and dental pain (38.5%). Children and adolescents had taken cold/cough medicine (48.1%), acetaminophen (15.0%), antacids (14.8%), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (105%) in the past year. Multivariate analysis results indicated that after controlling for pain experiences children and adolescents who had lower levels of medication knowledge and literacy were more likely to use pain medication and antacids more frequently. In addition, children and adolescents who had lower medication knowledge, lower literacy, asked doctors to prescribe antacids, and co-administered with antacids were more likely to report long-term use of antacids. Conclusions: Lower levels of medication knowledge and literacy among children and adolescents were associated with more frequent use of pain medication and antacids. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Demography	"All through the nineteenth century, Madeirans migrated from their Atlantic island to places as remote as Hawaii, California, Guyana and, later, South Africa. Scarcity of land, a rigid social structure, periodic famines and rampant poverty made many embark to uncertain destinies and endure the harsh labour conditions of sugarcane plantations. In the 1880s, a few hundred Madeirans engaged in a different venture: an experience of ""engineered migration"" sponsored by the Portuguese government to colonize the southern Angola plateau. White settlements, together with military control, scientific surveys and expeditions, contributed to strengthen the claims of European nations over specific territories in Africa. At that time, the long lasting claims of Portugal over African territories were not matched by sponsored colonial settlements or precise geographic knowledge about the claimed lands. There was little else representing Portugal than the leftover structures of the slave trade, the penal colonies and the free-lance merchants that ventured inland. In fear of losing land to the neighbouring German, Boer and British groups in south-western Africa, the Portuguese government tried then to promote white settlements by attracting farmers from the mainland into the southern plateau of Angola. As very few responded to the call, the settlement consisted mostly of Madeiran islanders, who were eager to migrate anywhere and took the adventure of Angola as just another destiny out of the island where they could not make a living. Their bodies and actions in the new place became highly surveilled by the medical delegates in charge of assessing their adaptation. The reports document what were then the idealized biopolitics of migration and colonization, interweaving biomedical knowledge and political power over displaced bodies and colonized land. At the same time, those records document the frustrations of the administration about the difficulties of the settlement experience and the ways in which colonial delegates blamed their failure on the very subjects who enacted and suffered through it. The eugenicism and racialism that pervade those writings, a currency during the age of empire, may now be out of taste both in science and in politics; however, they are not fully out of sight, and the subtle entrance of social prejudice into the hard concepts of biomedical science is still with us. Learning from this example may help analysing contemporary processes of medicalizing diversity or pathologizing the mobile populations, or, in other words, the biopolitics of migration in the 21(st) century."
Public Administration	Activation services that aim at re-employment of jobseekers often suffer from creaming', i.e. selecting those who have the best qualifications to re-enter the labour market. New ways of delivery, such as co-production, are supposed to be less subject to selection mechanisms. To analyse whether co-produced activation programmes suffer from selection biases, participants in a local innovative activation programme (n=60) were compared to non-participants (n=18). Participants are more motivated in general and showed higher levels of generalized, municipal and interpersonal trust. Moreover, high general motivation relates to high levels of trust and perceived control. This indicates that there is indeed a selection bias within co-produced activation programmes. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether co-production is more successful in dealing with creaming than common types of service delivery. Points for practitioners Public services, in the field of activation policies for instance, are increasingly delivered in a fashion that requires more responsibility and effort from users. This study shows that such demands elicit a selection of users. Professionals dealing with co-produced services should be aware that when they choose clients they are likely to leave out vulnerable individuals. In particular, when intrinsic motivation is an important selection criterion, those who have low levels of trust and perceived control will not be involved. Consequently, seemingly inclusive strategies could in fact lead to exclusion.
Cultural Studies	This article puts forward the thesis that in the age of multiculturalism, global communication is rooted in cross-cultural understanding as shown in McLuhan's late communication theory. The American philosopher Ernest Fenollosa went to Japan during the Meiji Restoration when it started in earnest full-scale Westernization. He became fascinated with the poetics of sinography manifested in etymosinology. Etymosinology reveals the depth of the Sinic cultural soul, which is this-worldly, practical, concrete and specific. Sinism (i.e. Confucianism, Daoism and Chan/Zen Buddhism) is a species of relational ontology which is predicated upon the conception of reality as social process. This social process is always already embodied. With the aid of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of embodiment, I critically explore and examine the connection between embodiment and 'new media' theory.
Public Administration	Scientific conversations can be riddled with confusion when contributions to the discussion are based on notions about ways of knowing that remain implicit. Researchers often mix different methodological positions in their research designs because they lack an awareness of the distinctions between different ways of knowing and their associated methods. The authors engage and reflect on these differences, with particular attention to four areas: research question formulations, the character and role of concepts and theories, hypotheses versus puzzles, and case study research. They call on all researchers, both academics and practitioners, to be aware of the ways in which scientific terms serve, in research debates, as signifiers of different logics of inquiry. Awareness of these differences is important for the sake of productive scientific discussions and for the logical consistency of research, as both of the ways of knowing discussed here are legitimate scientific endeavors, albeit invoking different evaluative criteria.
Family Studies	Women, particularly those in coresidential unions, have previously been found to spend less time commuting to work than men. This gender gap among couples' commuting has been linked to inferior labor market opportunities for women. How gender differences in commuting emerge on entering coresidence is underresearched, however. This study examines changes in commuting times at the transition from singlehood to coresidential unions using the British Household Panel Survey (1992-2008; N = 8,122 individuals). Results from fixed effects regression indicate that men increase their commuting time when entering coresidential unions. For childless women, entering coresidential unions is not associated with changes in commuting time. Mothers reduce their commuting time on entering coresidential unions. Changes in labor income and domestic housework responsibilities, previously suggested as likely explanations, are not found to contribute to observed changes in commuting among those entering coresidential unions in this study.
Demography	Using a unique sample on ageing first generation immigrants in France, we explore the distribution of grandchild care across offspring and the impact of this transfer on the labour supply of the mother. Our results indicate that grandchild care is spread unequally across siblings, and this inequality is driven more strongly by better labour market potential than by weaker financial status of the recipient. There is further evidence that even after accounting for potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, grandchild care has a positive impact on the labour supply of the mother. The pattern of intergenerational time transfers differs across people with different national and religions backgrounds.
Transportation	Population growth can lead to public school capacity issues as well as increased school bus utilization, which, in turn, can result in longer school bus transport times for regular and special needs students. Special needs or medically fragile students are children with special health care needs who are at increased health and safety risk. It is common practice to provide special needs students with specially-equipped buses and/or special classroom environments with specific facilities or services. However, the assignment of student services to schools is regularly made without regard to bus transportation considerations for special needs students. Considering the potentially negative impact of long school bus rides on these students, we present the first systematic, integrated analyses of special needs student busing and classroom assignments. We provide models and algorithms for maintaining administration-based transportation financial performance measures while simultaneously designing smarter transportation networks considering both student geographical location and service needs.
Social Issues	With a history of civic associations turned political, and an ongoing sociopolitical transformation in Egypt, social entrepreneurship (SE) has proliferated as an alternative to traditional forms of civic engagement such as charities on one hand and open activism on the other. Yet, situated between a desire for change, and the overpowering state and market logics, SE has been both limited and shaped by neoliberal and local-authoritarian visions. Using Egypt as the case, this study combines in-depth interviews with civil society practitioners, and field observation at an SE incubator, to examine how SE came to embody a desire for change using publicly sanctioned logics, all while enacting practices that preserve/revitalize a social movement in abeyance. By examining SE as part of a larger phenomenon in this particular moment of transition, this timely research allows us to investigate a link between social movements and SE not as two separate phenomena but as different ways of approaching the same thing: creating social transformation.
Communication	Contemporary mobile-phone technology is becoming increasingly similar around the world. However, cultural differences between countries may also shape mobile-phone practices. This study examines a group of variables connected to mobile-phone use among university students in Sweden, the USA and Japan. Key cultural issues addressed are attitudes towards quiet in public space, personal use of public space and tolerance of self-expression. Measures include the appropriateness of using mobiles in various social contexts and judgments of what respondents like most and like least about having a mobile phone. Analysis revealed a number of culturally associated differences, as well as a shared conflicting attitude towards the advantages and disadvantages of reachability by mobile phone.
Law	"This article explores the interface between classic government structures the courts and key governance tools soli law It presents the quantitative and qualitative results of research that asks the questions of whether and how soli law is reflected in the European competition and state aid case law It suggests that soli law is taken seriously by the Court of Justice of the European Union, and figures more and more in the judgments, orders and opinions issued in these areas. The case law recognises legal effects for soft law instruments through the mediation of general principles of law. The article argues that, through the mechanisms of the judicialisation process, the European Courts have rubber-stamped hybrid modes of regulating competition and state aid and have embedded soft law within the constitutional legal framework of the Union, while at the same time endowing traditional legal values with new functions in a ""new governance'' context."
Gerontology	Professional organizations in aging struggle to communicate effectively with the public about elder abuse. In 2017, the National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) partnered with the FrameWorks Institute in the Reframing Elder Abuse project, creating an evidence-based communication strategy that could elevate the issue with the public and boost support for systemic solutions to prevent and address elder abuse. In this article, NCEA staff describe why the strategy was needed, explain project progress, and state long-term goals.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	In this article we examine the process by which a group of marginal health-care professionals portray the legitimacy of their skills and services to potential clients. While extensive attention has been devoted to this construal of legitimacy through such affinitive alignments, much less attention has been given to elucidating the factors shaping how marginal social groups construct alternative professional legitimacy frameworks with which to contest dominant competitors. Drawing on qualitative content analysis of direct entry midwives' (DEMs) online descriptions of their practices and in-depth interviews, we explain how DEMs construe professional legitimacy through alternative cultural understandings of maternity care and experience. Our study highlights three key components of DEMs' professional legitimation: midwives' alignment with professional associations and scientific research, the creation of new understandings of care relationships and space, and the role of emotions in defining the optimal birth experience. We argue that the positive emotions associated with direct entry midwifery care become critical mechanisms for redefining both professionalism and the experience of birth within the boundaries of alternative practice.

Linguistics	"The current Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013) officially ended Ndau's status as a dialect of Shona by recognising it as a separate language. The linguistic status of Ndau has been debated since Clement Doke's unification of Shona dialects in 1931. The question ""Is Ndau a dialect of Shona or rather a separate language?"" has proven disputable in academia. This intellectual debate exposes the extent of attached political sensitivities, linguistic complexities and sociolinguistic uncertainties regarding the matter. Acknowledging the difficulty of distinguishing between languages and dialects this article introduces an integrated approach to the Ndau/Shona debate by unifying four competing models: the historical, the linguistic, the sociolinguistic, and the political perspectives. This creates a platform to examine historical and structural linguistic features and cognitive elements as well as affective and emotional aspects informing the Ndau/Shona debate. The consolidated findings indicate that despite existing similarities between the two varieties Ndau is a separate language in Zimbabwe."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Environmental epigenetics is the study of how environmental signals affect gene expression. Within this growing field of molecular biology, experiments on the epigenetic effects of 'maternal care' on offspring health have received much scientific and public attention and are often called upon to showcase how environmental epigenetics will create a new understanding of life as inherently 'biosocial.' While, on the one hand, this research is exciting and offers possible opportunities for collaboration between molecular biology and the social sciences, it is also necessary to consider its political dimensions. In this paper, we show how commonsense assumptions about sex, gender, sexuality, and class are present in the design, interpretation, and dissemination of experiments on the epigenetic effects of maternal care. As these experiments come to support claims about human motherhood through a dense speculative cross-traffic between epigenetic studies in rodents and psychological and epidemiological studies in humans, current research trends work to illustrate rather than interrogate existing stereotypes about maternal agency and responsibility. With this analysis, we offer a cautionary perspective regarding the potentials and challenges for new forms of collaborative biosocial knowledge practices emerging out of environmental epigenetics.
Social Work	This systematic review aims to inform practitioners about the current research-informed practices that are available to treat adolescents who struggle with Non Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). A computer based search of the literature was conducted via five databases and resulted in the retrieval of 595 articles, seven of which met all the inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed, published in English between 2000 and 2016, differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-harm, were randomized control trials of interventions, and targeted adolescents age 12-18 who were not diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorders). Four psychosocial interventions were identified, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, mentalization based treatment for adolescents, developmental group intervention, and therapeutic assessment and brief intervention. At this time, there is no published randomized control trial that demonstrates a significant reduction in NSSI among adolescents. This further highlights the urgent need to develop and test effective and varied interventions for adolescents presenting with NSSI.
Business, Finance	"This study investigates whether auditor quality and audit committee expertise are associated with improved financial reporting timeliness as measured by the duration of a financial statement restatement's ""dark period."" The restatement dark period represents the length of time between a company's discovery that it will need to restate financial data and the subsequent disclosure of the restatement's effect on earnings. For a sample of dark restatements disclosed between 2004 and 2009, we find that companies that engage Big 4 auditors have shorter dark periods than companies that do not engage Big 4 auditors. We also find that companies with more financial experts on the audit committee have shorter dark periods, but only when such financial expertise relates specifically to accounting. Finally, companies with audit committee chairs that have accounting financial expertise provide the most timely disclosures, as the dark periods for these firms are reduced by approximately 38 percent. Our results suggest that both auditor and audit committee expertise are associated with the timely disclosure of restatement details."
Industrial Relations & Labor	Performance appraisal interviews (PAI) are in a Scandinavian context supposed to be dialogues between equal partners. This implies a focus on the superior and subordinate as conducting a conversation more than an interview, and a focus on development instead of performance. The article seeks to investigate how these ideals are lived up to in the practice of conducting a PAI. On the basis of a corpus of 30 hours of videotaped PAIs and applying a conversation analytical approach, the study shows that interactional symmetries and asymmetries can arise as a consequence of interactional practices that are dynamically negotiated between and agreed upon by the co-participants on a turn-by-turn basis. These symmetries and asymmetries emerge due to the participants' orientations to institutional and social norms that can intertwine and overlap, thus impeding, postponing or supporting the ideals of PAIs as being dialogues between equal partners.
Substance Abuse	Introduction and AimsThe study aimed to determine injecting drug users' (IDU) attitudes, and correlates of attitudes, towards continued prohibition, decriminalisation or legalisation of the major illicit drugs. Design and MethodsThis study used structured interview with 300 IDUs who had injected on at least a weekly basis over the preceding 12 months. ResultsMethamphetamine was rated the most harmful of the five illicit substances and cannabis the lowest. By far the highest level of support for legislative change was for cannabis, with only 8.7% supporting continued prohibition. While there was majority support for change to the legal status of heroin, the modal position was for decriminalisation. Support for changing the status of the three illicit psychostimulants was low, with the majority believing that methamphetamine (63.3%), cocaine (53.3%) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (53.3%) should remain illegal. Demographic characteristics were largely unrelated to attitudes. Lower levels of perceived harm were associated with increased likelihood of support for legalisation of all substances. Recent use was positively related to support for both decriminalisation and legality of heroin, but was not associated with views on other substances. Higher lifetime polydrug use was associated with support for the legalisation of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine. Discussion and ConclusionsIDUs expressed nuanced views on different substances. In policy debates, care should be taken not to speak for IDUs by imputing their beliefs. It is clear that the fact that a group uses illegal drugs does not necessarily imply that they support changes to their legal status. [Darke S, Torok M. Attitudes of regular injecting drug users towards the legal status of the major illicit drugs. Drug Alcohol Rev 2013;32:483-488]
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Despite increasing efforts during data collection, nonresponse remains sizeable in many household surveys. Statistical adjustment is hence unavoidable. By reweighting the design, weights of the respondents are adjusted to compensate for nonresponse. However, there is no consensus on how this should be carried out in general. Theoretical comparisons are inconclusive in the literature, and the associated simulation studies involve hypothetical situations not all equally relevant to reality. In this article we evaluate the three most common reweighting approaches in practice, based on real data in Norway from the two largest household surveys in the European Statistical System. We demonstrate how cross-examination of various reweighting estimators can help inform the effectiveness of the available auxiliary variables and the choice of the weight adjustment method.
Demography	BACKGROUND Despite much discussion on the fertility changes in sub-Saharan Africa, the countries of the Sahel have received only limited attention. Their comparatively high and stable fertility levels contributed them being labeled as an exception in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE This study investigates whether countries of the Sahel are an exception in the cross-continental trend of increasing birth intervals since the 1970s in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS Using birth history data, the levels and trends in parity progression ratios and birth intervals are reconstructed for four decades in four countries of the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, and Niger). RESULTS In all four countries, parity progression ratios have changed little, but births have been occurring later and the age at which an average woman is bearing her seventh child has increased. CONCLUSIONS While the lengthening of birth intervals has been associated with lower fertility in many analyses, this study shows that a similar process is found in countries with high and stable total fertility rates. CONTRIBUTION This study contributes to revise some commonly accepted views on the fertility dynamics in the Sahel.
Sociology	Based on a sequence of policy changes in Germany's parental leave programme, the article uses an interrupted time-series design to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between mothers' labour force behaviour and family policy. Using event history modelling techniques and 1984-2010 data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, the analysis shows that mothers have strongly responded to various changes to Germany's parental leave programme, including both entitlement extensions and incentives to speed their return to work. As transition rates at which mothers return to employment generally fall while being covered by parental leave entitlements but peak when entitlements are exhausted, five consecutive entitlement extensions between 1986 and 1992 have empirically been accompanied by respective increases in the duration of employment interruptions following childbirth. This upward trend has partly been reversed by stronger monetary and procedural incentives for shorter leave-taking implemented in 2001, but more consistently so by the introduction of Germany's new 12-month earnings-related parental leave benefit programme in 2007. Respective behavioural changes are observable among both East and West German mothers despite long-standing differences in gender culture and availability of public childcare.
Nursing	Aim: To investigate student nurse recruitment and attrition in the 1950' and 1960s and undertake comparisons to modern day concerns. The study was set in one hospital in the UK. Background: In the period studied nursing was unpopular as a profession and there were difficulties surrounding recruitment. Attrition rates were high. Method: Documentary analysis of 641 training records dating 1955 to 1968 was undertaken. Attrition rates, reasons for non-completion and employment following successful completion were determined. Results: Most recruits were young, unmarried, females and had overseas addresses. The majority (n = 88) had prior nursing experience. Over 69% (n = 443) successfully completed their training. Attrition rates were over 30% (n = 198), the main reason being academic failure. Following completion over 40% (n = 183) undertook midwifery training (n = 183) or secured a staff nurse post (n = 153). Conclusions: Issues relating to recruitment, retention and attrition in the 1950s and 1960s put into context present day issues. Recent attrition rates from pre-registration nurse education have fallen, nevertheless some of the issues of yesteryear remain problematic. In the present study significant numbers of entrants left due to domestic and ill-health problems resonates with many modern day studies. Also failure to complete due to academic shortcomings continues to be a concern. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Education & Educational Research	In recent years, the success rates of different groups of students in higher education have come under considerable scrutiny, with gender and ethnicity identified as key attributes predicting differential achievement of good degrees'. A review of previous studies highlights the need for research which looks beyond the deficit model' to explain the attainment gap. This research used a mixed-methods approach to explore the academic and social experiences of students, as well as lecturers' views on student achievement, in one UK University. Findings suggest that there are significant differences in motivation and confidence speaking English for different ethnic groups in this study, and a divergence in attendance and study time by gender - both of which may go some way to helping understand the gaps in attainment. In addition, male and BME students tended to overestimate their likelihood of achieving a good degree outcome, compared to other groups.
Urban Studies	"As just a county level city in China, Yiwu's rise to global renown is a compelling story. Despite its antiquity, its rise dates largely from market liberalization in 1978. Leveraging its traditional role as a petty market center, it relied on an early start and subsequent agglomeration economies to grow these markets. The demand for goods in these markets begot manufacturing of these goods, creating backward linkages. The growth of these markets led to its unique version of internationalization - ""shopping tourism"" and as a venue for conventions. This pattern of growth, dubbed the ""Yiwu model"" is distinctive in that it relied on home-grown small trading enterprises, as opposed to the better-known model of large firms - foreign investment nexus found in export zones. Also distinctive is the strong role played by the Yiwu government working hand-in-glove with private entrepreneurs to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. This partnership will need to overcome challenges that come with this model of growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Development Studies	This paper focuses on key areas for reducing transport costs in Southern Africa emerging from recent research on cross-border freight between Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We consider the impact of competition, border delays and lack of return loads on transport rates which could be reduced significantly through increased availability of return loads for transporters, linked to growing industrial capacity in each country. Furthermore, increased competition and reducing delays for transporters contributed to a large reduction in transport rates between Lusaka and Johannesburg, with similar effects from Malawi. Margins charged in refrigerated transport are high due to low levels of rivalry and lack of return loads. Measures to reduce border constraints and enable greater rivalry between transporters from different countries could have a downward effect on transport rates in the region which are shown to be above benchmarks for efficient transport.
Area Studies	This article explores the representation of amulpullun, or Mapuche funeral ritual, in the poetry collection Reducciones of Jaime Huenun, a Mapuche-Huilliche author. It analyzes several poems in which the lyrical subject, assuming the role of speaker of amulpullun, performs a ritual invocation to the spirits of dead Mapuche to ensure their transition to the afterlife. This study also examines four collages created from photographs and documents archived at the Museo de La Plata in Argentina, as they constitute an alternative channel of enunciation of funeral rituals. These poems and collages recover the stories of the people represented in them, symbolically integrating them into the historical memory of their societies through the literary strategy of amulpullun. In addition, the texts draw parallels between the stories of these people, denouncing how, in different ways, they were permeated by violence, exclusion and oblivion.
Public Administration	Social policy change has been discussed extensively in comparative welfare state research, beyond a mere social expenditure approach. Unfortunately, conceptually and methodologically informed debates have only marginally influenced countries other than in the Western world, leaving research on East Asian welfare states almost unaffected by the dependent variable problem. This study aims to fill this gap by summarizing some key features from the social policy change literature, and by analyzing it for the South Korean welfare state through nationally representative survey-based data (2006-2013). The findings suggest that after adjusting for needs, and disaggregating policy fields, social policies in Korea are not changing linearly; rather, it looks as if old social policies are fairly stable, whereas new ones have grown during the time under observation, following a path of institutional layering.
Management	"In this essay, we offer perspectives on the future of small business research. These comments cover a range of issues unique to the future of small-business-focused research from ""somewhat-broad"" to ""more-narrow,"" and address: (1) the problems and promise of better theory building, (2) the range of opportunities for theory-building research, (3) new vantage points for theory-building using the ""social responsibility"" of small business as a research lens, and (4) the future direction of research in technological entrepreneurship. We conclude with a summary of this ""look to the future,"" and call for the innovative and provocative research that can keep contemporary small business management research at the center of the academic action."
History & Philosophy Of Science	Communication and behaviour of animals living ex situ has been one of the major sources of knowledge about wild animals. Nevertheless, it is also acknowledged that depending on the environment that the animals inhabit (or are kept in), there are differences in their communication and behaviour. With some species (especially large mammals) it is difficult to reproduce their natural environment to an extent that excludes deviations from the behaviour and communication exhibited by animals living in situ. In zoological gardens, welfare measures are introduced in order to counteract the effects of the captive environment and to grant an individual's good physical and psychological well-being. The relation between good welfare and species-specific communication and behaviour is discussed, and as a result, a general model of ex situ animal communication and behaviour is proposed. The suggested model is inclusive of differences between captive animals and free-ranging animals and serves to explain the welfare-related reasons underlying individual animal's deviations from species-specific behaviour and communication.
Management	When multiple redundant probabilistic judgments are obtained from subject matter experts, it is common practice to aggregate their differing views into a single probability or distribution. Although many methods have been proposed for mathematical aggregation, no single procedure has gained universal acceptance. The most widely used procedure is simple arithmetic averaging, which has both desirable and undesirable properties. Here we propose an alternative for aggregating distribution functions that is based on the median cumulative probabilities at fixed values of the variable. It is shown that aggregating cumulative probabilities by medians is equivalent, under certain conditions, to aggregating quantiles. Moreover, the median aggregate has better calibration than mean aggregation of probabilities when the experts are independent and well calibrated and produces sharper aggregate distributions for well-calibrated and independent experts when they report a common location-scale distribution. We also compare median aggregation to mean aggregation of quantiles.
Law	"In comparative perspective, the American religion state regime is generally considered as strictly separationist, with a ""wall of separation"" keeping religion and state apart. This article traces a recent more away from this toward a European-style ""modest establishment,"" in which religion and state cooperate in the fulfillment of important social jUnctions. The inecluinisin for bringing about this change has been an increasingly conservative Supreme Court that has partially incorporated the agenda of the Christian Right. However; the attack on separationistn was differently successful in different domains. The greatest success has been achieved with respect to access to public resources, where the wall of separation has been ""breached."" With respect to religious symbols in the public sphere, I argue, the wall has merely been ""battered."" This is because the state t7an align itself with religion only inditxctly, by secularizing it as culture and tradition. These developments are contrasted with religion state relations in Europe, which have moved in the opposite direction, l'rotti vestigial establishment to stronger forms of separation."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	"The purpose of this research is to determine if there is any relationship between employee creativity and job-related motivators, using a case study of hotel employees in Hong Kong. From a sample of 983 employees, canonical correlation indicated there is a relationship between creativity and job-related motivators. Furthermore, the risk-taking dimension under creativity was found to be more correlated to the intrinsic job-related motivators. Intrinsic job-related motivators which include opportunity for advancement and development, loyalty to employees, appreciation and praise of work done, feelings of being involved, sympathetic help with personal problems and interesting work, are found to encourage the hotel employees' risk-taking behavior. A ""See-Saw"" model is presented to show the relationship between the two opposing sides: intrinsic motivators and extrinsic motivators versus creativity and risk-taking factors.

Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Brazil has not had endemic circulation of the measles virus since 2000. Between May and June 2011, the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, reported three cases of measles. This report presents a descriptive study of the cases, control measures, and the search for a possible source and secondary cases. The genotypic characterization of the virus identified genotype D4, circulating in Europe. Secondary cases or index case were not found. The control measures and adequate vaccination coverage in Metropolitan Region of Campinas contributed to the interruption of disease transmission.
Gerontology	The portrayal of older characters in television commercials has over time become more varied and positive. This study examines how different portrayals of older characters relate to self-stereotyping, a process through which older individuals apply their beliefs about older people in general to themselves and behave accordingly. The study thereby seeks to connect, as few have previously done, cultural studies and critiques of media portrayals with psychological studies of the effects of self-stereotyping. Sixty participants aged 65-75 years were primed with television commercials that portrayed older characters in different ways: 'warm and incompetent', 'warm and competent', and 'cold and competent'. It was hypothesised that priming with warm/incompetent portrayals would have a negative effect on memory performance because such representations match the dominant stereotype, and that the effect would occur only among older people who identify with their own age group. It was found that the participants who identified with their own age group did indeed show impaired memory performance after priming with warm/incompetent portrayals, but also that the same effect was found after priming with warm/competent portrayals. The findings are discussed in terms of resistance against stereotyping by older individuals themselves as well as by media producers.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The prevalence of gender wage gaps in academic work is well documented, but patterns of advantage or disadvantage linked to marital, motherhood, and fatherhood statuses have been less explored among college and university faculty. Drawing from a nationally representative sample of faculty in the US, we explore how the combined effects of marriage, children, and gender affect faculty salaries in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) and non-SEM fields. We examine whether faculty members' productivity moderates these relationships and whether these effects vary between SEM and non-SEM faculty. Among SEM faculty, we also consider whether placement in specific disciplinary groups affects relationships between gender, marital and parental status, and salary. Our results show stronger support for fatherhood premiums than for consistent motherhood penalties. Although earnings are reduced for women in all fields relative to married fathers, disadvantages for married mothers in SEM disappear when controls for productivity are introduced. In contrast to patterns of motherhood penalties in the labor market overall, single childless women suffer the greatest penalties in pay in both SEM and non-SEM fields. Our results point to complex effects of family statuses on the maintenance of gender wage disparities in SEM and non-SEM disciplines, but married mothers do not emerge as the most disadvantaged group.
Development Studies	Understanding how capital flows within rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa can provide important insights on the nature of poverty and the effectiveness of financial intermediation. We use unique individual-level savings and borrowing data to study the flow of funds within a sample of 104 Ugandan savings groups. We show that poor households borrow from wealthier households, which implies that the marginal benefit of money is decreasing in wealth. Other individual characteristics do not predict the flow of funds within the group. We also fail to detect evidence that members are using savings groups to smooth out occupation-specific income shocks. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	This article proposes a model-based procedure, intended for personality measures, for exploiting the auxiliary information provided by the certainty with which individuals answer every item (response certainty). This information is used to (a) obtain more accurate estimates of individual trait levels, and (b) provide a more detailed assessment of the consistency with which the individual responds to the test. The basis model consists of 2 submodels: an item response theory submodel for the responses, and a linear-in-the-coefficients submodel that describes the response certainties. The latter is based on the distance-difficulty hypothesis, and is parameterized as a factor-analytic model. Procedures for (a) estimating the structural parameters, (b) assessing modeldata fit, (c) estimating the individual parameters, and (d) assessing individual fit are discussed. The proposal was used in an empirical study. Modeldata fit was acceptable and estimates were meaningful. Furthermore, the precision of the individual trait estimates and the assessment of the individual consistency improved noticeably.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Strauss' Continual Permutations of Action provides a theoretical framework for analysis in this constructivist grounded theory study that examines Australian rural nurses' experiences of mentoring. The trajectory of cultivating and growing rural nurses is discussed in relation to the context or social world that participants exist within. Subconcepts of trajectory, namely the arc of action, trajectory phasing, trajectory projection, trajectory scheme, trajectory management and reciprocal impact are used to explain findings from Cultivating and Growing Rural Nurses: A grounded theory in order to shed light on the processual ordering of participants' experiences of mentoring.

Rehabilitation	Background and purpose. Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears can produce excellent results. The application of platelet rich plasma during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is safe, and produces results which do not deteriorate over time. Methods. A total of 14 patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of a rotator cuff tear received an intra-operative application of autologous platelet rich plasma in combination with an autologous thrombin component after tear repair. Following the procedure, patients were given a standardized rehabilitation protocol, and followed for 24 months. Outcome measures included a pain score (VAS) as well as functional scoring (UCLA and Constant scores). Results. Of the original 14 patients, 13 were seen at a final follow-up appointment 24 months after the index operation. Patients demonstrated a significant decrease in VAS scores and significant increases in the UCLA and Constant scores at 6, 12 and 24-month follow-ups compared to a pre-operative score. Conclusion. No adverse events related to this application were noted during the procedure. The application of platelet rich plasma during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is safe and effective, and produces results which seem to be stable with time. A prospective randomized investigation will be necessary to ascertain the efficacy of platelet rich plasma application to improve or expedite the surgical outcome following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
Cultural Studies	In his media ethics, Roger Silverstone was particularly sceptical of the idea that increasing mediaconnectedness in itself is set to improve our overall moral condition or to foster a cosmopolitan cultural outlook. In arguing that we need to go 'beyond connection', he raised the broader issue of the cultural condition that an intensely connected environment is establishing, and posed questions of the kinds of relatedness, the sense of belonging, the moral horizons and awareness of responsibilities that such a condition entails. This article takes an historical approach to these issues by considering how mediated connectivity may have been regarded, particularly in relation to the ideas of internationalism and cosmopolitanism, during the 1930s. Considering this earlier period of modernity - in which media technologies and institutions were emerging as significant shapers of cultural attitudes, but before they had achieved the ubiquity and the taken-for-grantedness of today - can, it will suggested, offer a useful perspective on our own globalized, media-saturated times.
Ethnic Studies	Contemporary public debates on social cohesion in Europe at both the European Union (EU) and member-state level tend to reduce the topic to the problem' of immigration by third-country nationals, and the integration of these immigrants and their descendants into European national societies. These debates often emphasize a culturalist perspective on the social cohesion of national societies based on core national cultures, identities and histories that pre-date the mass immigration of non-EU/European Economic Area immigrants, with social cohesion depending on their identifiable assimilation to this core set of values, beliefs and behaviours. This culture-based perspective on social cohesion has become an integral component of the neoliberal reorganization of the interventionist state in Europe that both punishes the native poor and coerces the immigrant third-country national as it frees markets and restructures the European welfare state. Yet, an examination of European social cohesion policies across seven policy domains suggests that the problem of social cohesion has little to do either with the issue of immigration or of immigrant and ethnic minority integration. However, it does have a lot to do with increasing inequalities and insecurities in European societies that result from neoliberal political economic policies. Drawing on Emile Durkheim's seminal discussion of social cohesion that includes structural and cultural dimensions, Boucher analyses the seven policy domains of European social cohesions within a functionalist framework that highlights inconsistencies, policy gaps and internal tensions between the domains. His analysis suggests the need for a more coherent, integrated and multilevel governance policy framework based on social justice, socio-economic equality and cultural diversity to achieve the elusive goal of social cohesion in Europe.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Is there a correct way to ascertain social fact? As late as the 1950s, the scientific community remained divided over this question. Its resolution involved not just epistemological and theoretical debates on the unity or disunity of statistical science but also practical considerations surrounding state-capacity building. For scientists in places like the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union, at stake was the very ability to realize the kind of planned economic growth that socialist countries idealized. The solution they chose reformulated statistics explicitly as a social science, salvaging it from what they then dismissed as the tainted, bourgeois, and socially unproductive pursuit of mathematical statistics. This distinctionmost tangibly understood as the rejection of all probabilistic methodshad implications for both the ways in which data was collected and the ways in which it was analyzed.
Ethnic Studies	The positive relationship between education and exogamy has been well established in the literature; however, we know less regarding the mechanisms behind this relationship as well as the heterogeneity of this relationship across groups and household types.(1) Thus, this paper analyzes different forms of household types for descendants focusing on the relationship between education and exogamy.(1) Focusing on the role of education both at the individual and at the group level contributes to our understanding of current and future trends regarding social and family structures in destination countries. High quality data at the individual level, from Statistics Sweden, for the whole population of interest are utilized. The overall results confirm the positive relationship between education and exogamy. However, not only education at the individual level but also at the group level is important. Furthermore, this relationship varies across the educational distribution, gender, as well as household type.
Sociology	Bridewealth is fundamental to marriage in Africa. Anthropological research provides substantial information regarding characteristics of the bridewealth transaction, but scholars and policymakers know little about its consequences for women in contemporary Africa. We argue that the payment of bridewealth strengthens normative constraints on women's autonomy in the reproductive domain. We test and find support for our argument using a unique vignette experiment conducted with rural women in the Volta Region of Ghana.
Transportation	This article presents an agent-based travel demand model, where agents react to transport supply across all mobility choices. Long-term choices include mobility tool ownership and work locations. Daily travel patterns are simulated at the individual level by sequentially combining activity frequency, activity durations and destinations as well as a rule-based time-of-day scheduling. A key to success in this novel approach is balancing individual preferences of travelers with system constraints. The model incorporates two types of constraints: 1) capacity constraints of the transport infrastructure. 2) natural time and space constraints during the execution of individual 24-hour day plans. Model results are validated against empirical observations of travel demand in Switzerland. The article concludes with a perspective for further research and development in the field of applied agent-based modeling.
Substance Abuse	This paper contains a systematic review of articles about the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and alcohol and drug use that were published between 1997 and 2006. Summaries of methodological characteristics (e.g., study design, sample size and composition, specific dimensions of religiosity, and substances investigated) and general findings of 105 studies provide an overview of the field. The association between religiosity/spirituality and reduced risk of substance use is well established, but a well defined body of knowledge on this relationship has been slow to emerge. The development of more sophisticated instrumentation to measure religiosity and spirituality, the investigation of samples that include users of major drugs of abuse, and the integration of the study of religion and drug use into the broader literature on religion and health can help the field build upon the considerable work that has been published.
Law	This article sheds light on the economic and regulatory reasons for not holding limitations of pharmaceutical parallel trade within the European Union as unlawful per se. It traces the different regulatory systems applied by EU Member States, and explains how this variety increases the levels of parallel trade. Moreover, it analyses the size and nature of pharmaceutical R & D costs, and briefly describes alternative means of protecting R & D investment, other than limitations of parallel trade. Furthermore, the welfare effects of parallel trade are analysed. The way that the Court of Justice and the General Court have dealt with limitations of pharmaceutical parallel trade in landmark cases, and the relevant economic justifications advanced, are also presented. Finally, the article deals with the constitutional issue of whether the principle of market integration should be prioritised over consumer welfare in the context of the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union.
Education, Special	This paper seeks to compare the evolution of inclusive education policy in the four countries of an EU-funded research project (QualiTYDES) operating under the shared policy environment of the UN, EU and European Commission. A shared policy cannot of course be assumed to result in common legislative or provisional outcomes at national level. The different sociocultural, political, historical and economic contexts in each country shape its journey towards 'compliance' with an international convention (both pre- and post-ratification), and neither the route nor the destination can be assumed to be shared, given the scope for different interpretations of the same texts. This paper places the implementation trajectories of four European countries side by side as they attempt to move towards 'inclusive' education systems. Following a brief overview of the international education policy environment relating to the education of people with disabilities, we describe the national education policy responses in Ireland, Austria, Spain and Czech Republic in recent decades, including both legislation pertaining to special educational need and implementation of policies in practice. The comparison highlights the different manifestations of inclusive education current in each country, and also explores the challenges which have arisen as individual countries attempt to align international policy with provision in existing education systems, each with their own legacy interests, pressures and priorities. Examples of 'gaps' in this alignment are where learners with disabilities/SEN are likely to be failed, and represent the critical points at which barriers to fully inclusive education arise and negatively impact opportunity over the life course.
Economics	"China""s small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have contributed to growth and created millions of jobs. However, SMEs are frequently perceived as facing financing difficulties. This paper illustrates that (1) financing difficulties are more acute in smaller cities; (2) spreads between SMEs and large enterprises appear higher in part due to implicit fees and charges by banks and higher credit risks for SMEs; and (3) greater financial penetration in small cities could reduce the financing cost. These findings could help formulate policies to support SME financing. Strengthening financial inclusion with safeguards, particularly in small cities, could bring significant gains. Measures to build a sound financial infrastructure would improve credit to SMEs, including unified credit registry and extending eligible collaterals. Broadening sources of finance by taking advantage of technology-provided with adequate supervision-and addressing implicit guarantees could help SME financing."
Economics	The 2008 economic crash led to remarkable shifts of opinion among world leaders. Does this crisis create favourable conditions for the reform and revitalisation of economics itself-from a subject dominated by mathematical techniques to a discipline more oriented to understanding real-world institutions and actors? And why were warnings of financial collapse not heeded? Recent shortcomings are partly related to the global triumph of market individualist ideology and partly to the exaggerated roles of modelling and quantification. These failures of economics are partly peculiar to the discipline and also a result of other wider institutional and cultural forces.
Development Studies	The close and reciprocal ties between poverty and environmental degradation present significant potential for simultaneous improvement of the livelihood of the poorest along with increased opportunities and enhanced resilience of the environment and natural resources. By supporting governments and other stakeholders in designing and implementing development plans that tackle environmental and poverty concerns in a joint manner, the globally operating UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) addresses a major governance challenge for sustainable development (SD) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular. Focusing on Central Asia, and specifically Tajikistan, a country outside the spotlight of studies concerned with SD governance mechanisms, and through the analysis of PEI programme documents and stakeholders' interviews, this article probes into the governance and governance co-ordination (metagovernance) settings for SD. The article closes by presenting a set of recommendations to improve governance co-ordination, while achieving more inclusive decision-making and ultimately increasing the impact of PEI on the society and the environment. Specifically, it argues for improved information policy and enhanced integration of endogenous knowledge. Furthermore, national and local development planning and private initiatives should be better linked, and the different levels of governance for poverty-environment mainstreaming should be more coherent. The solutions discussed are of relevance for wider Central Asia and the global community engaged in moving the SDGs into the mainstream of governance and policy frameworks.
Substance Abuse	This 2002 Medcen Foundation-funded study explored characteristics of problem drinking among 211 urban Venezuelan Native Americans of Arawak origin. Prevalence of problem drinking using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tests was 88.5% among men and 17.3% among women. Periodic binge drinking was marked by loss of control, failure to meet obligations, and alcohol-related trauma. Focus group participants noted that previous occasional binge drinking by men has been replaced by frequent male and female heavy weekend drinking, violence, and death. Limitations and implications are discussed. Awareness of high levels of problem drinking and desire for assistance present compelling mandates for community intervention efforts.
Business, Finance	We sort currencies into portfolios by countries' past consumption growth. The excess return of the highest-over the lowest-consumption-growth portfolio - our consumption carry factor - compensates for negative returns during world-wide downturns and prices the cross-section of portfolio-sorted and of bilateral currency returns. Empirically, sorting currencies on consumption growth is very similar to sorting currencies on interest rates. We interpret these stylized facts in a habit formation model: sorting currencies on past consumption growth approximates sorting on risk aversion. Low (high) risk-aversion currencies have high (low) interest rates and depreciate (appreciate) in times of global turmoil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Family Studies	Using a recent representative survey and supplemental interviews, we investigate household money management and domestic power dynamics in contemporary Russian two-partner families. During the Soviet period, it was women who typically managed household money. Today, while 45.6% of contemporary Russian two-partner households pool money and manage it jointly, and in about a quarter of families women are in charge, families with men in control of domestic money are on the rise among more affluent spouses who have been married for less than 20 years. While previous work finds evidence for the feminization of poverty in the postcommunist region, we underscore the otherwise hidden aspects of inequalitygendered access to household money among the relative winners of the transition: Younger and more affluent families. We place these changes in the context of neoliberal market reforms, including labor market and welfare policy changes and the rise of neoconservative gender ideology.
Health Policy & Services	To perform a systematic review, supplemented by a targeted grey literature scan, for performance measurement and improvement frameworks within and across the health, education and social service systems. The intended outcome was the creation of a foundation of evidence to inform the development of cross-sectoral quality improvement frameworks. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE, Social Services Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts and Education Index Full Text were searched up to April/May 2007. In addition, 26 governmental and 27 organizational websites were searched. English language material with a publication date of 1986 or more recent that described a health, education or social services multidimensional framework for performance measurement and improvement. The framework name; administrative sector; level of application; setting; population of interest; categories of quality described within the framework; country of application; and citations to other performance measurement and improvement frameworks were extracted from each article. In total, 111 frameworks were identified. Most frameworks (n = 97) were developed in or for the health sector. A concept sorting exercise identified 16 quality concepts applicable across many settings, sectors and levels of application. This systematic review of quality domains will be relevant and useful to those who are developing and using performance measurement and improvement frameworks for adult and child populations within or across the health, social service or education sectors.
Rehabilitation	The aim of this study was to test the congruence of patients' health valuations and physicians' treatment goals for the rehabilitation of chronically ill patients. In addition, patient characteristics associated with greater or less congruence were to be determined. In a questionnaire study, patients' health valuations and physicians' goals were assessed in three chronic conditions [breast cancer (BC), chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD), and chronic back pain (CBP)] using a ranking method. Sociodemographic variables and health-related quality of life were assessed as patient-related factors that influence congruence. Congruence was determined at the group (Spearman's rho) and individual levels (percentage of congruence). Patient-related influencing factors were calculated after a simple imputation using multiple logistic regression analysis. At the group level, there were often only low correlations. The mean percentage of congruence was 34.7% (BC), 48.5% (CIHD), and 31.9% (CBP). Patients with BC or CIHD who have a higher level of education showed greater congruence. Our results indicate some high discrepancy rates between physicians' treatment goals and patients' health valuations. It is possible that patients have preferences that do not correspond well with realistic rehabilitation goals or that physicians do not take patients' individual health valuations sufficiently into consideration when setting goals.

Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	"International research on educational inequality consistently reports the existence of ethnic differences in school achievement. The paper explores as a prior stage early cognitive differences between 3- to 4-year-old natives and immigrants in Germany and tests whether ethnic differences in cognitive outcomes can be essentially explained by the parents' social background and the home environment of the children. It is assumed that children's later educational success depends on their abilities at preschool age. The acquisition of these abilities is determined particularly by the family, the children's home environment and through institutional care. The data of a German project ""Preschool education and educational careers among migrant children"" reveal the existence of inequality in cognitive scores between natives and Turkish children. These differences cannot be explained by controlling for the social background of the families, nor by the home environment. A main result of the analyses shows that both factors are important."
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article analyzes an Australian theatre program that engaged diverse youth in (re)visioning citizenship and multiculturalism by creating new notions of belonging and altering perceptions of Aboriginal culture and its value in Australia. This kind of work - where young people's understandings of inclusion and diversity can be unsettled, critiqued, and developed - is crucial because current approaches to Australian multiculturalism tend to rely on Anglo-centric norms and fail to account for indigeneity. Drawing on participant observation and semi-structured interviews, I argue that youth theatre based on reflexive practices and cross-cultural sharing may offer a useful tool for young people's education for inclusive citizenship in a multicultural, super-diverse context. When practiced thoughtfully, such programs can offer space for rethinking citizenship and belonging in ways that recognize the centrality of Indigenous culture and critically reflect on the limitations of the dominant culture's reliance on Anglo cultural norms and ideas.
Management	Construction project performance relies on different dimensions of project management. Among those, integration management is of paramount importance since effective project management starts with the integration of processes and people within a construction project. This study investigates the influence of various components of integration management on construction project management performance and quantifies the relationship between those components and integration management. The proposed components of integration management are the development of a project charter, knowledge integration, process integration, staff integration, supply chain integration, and integration of changes; whereas the dimensions of project management performance are time, cost, quality, safety, and client satisfaction. A questionnaire was designed and administered to construction professionals and data from 121 projects was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The data was analyzed by using software, called SPSS AMOS. The findings of the research indicate that integration management has a strong impact on project management performance. The study contributes to the project management body of knowledge in that it develops a conceptual framework consisting of specific components for integration management, reveals the impact of integration management on performance, and proposes several tools and strategies for enabling effective integration along the project life cycle. Industry practitioners may benefit from the framework developed by considering the components proposed and following strategies recommended for construction phases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Rehabilitation	Leisure is commonly treated as a means instead of an end goal of intervention. This approach, influenced by history and society's past values, does not reflect the fact that leisure is meaningful and unique to its participants and has a significant effect on their health. On the basis of the core values of the occupational therapy profession and its role in the health care system, in this article we advocate that occupational therapists should expand their focus to include leisure as a goal of intervention. Although adopting this proposed approach may not be easy, given that it involves challenges in reimbursement for services, potential competition with other health professions, and a twisting of the deep-rooted existing values of occupational therapists, we believe the proposed solutions address these concerns and shed light on how to make leisure a valued goal of intervention.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This study aims to identify influential internship organization factors that affect student interns' industry employment intentions. A mixed-methods approach using both content analysis and questionnaire surveys was utilized to develop a practical scale and objectively reflect a variety of internship situations. The findings indicate that there are five internship organization factors: (1) interpersonal recognition, (2) benefit, (3) supervisor leadership, (4) job arrangement, and (5) training. The implications of this study offer preliminary insights into the hospitality industry, which aims to manage total quality initiatives. The results of this study lay the groundwork for the development of influential factors for the hospitality industry to retain prospective talent. In the long run, effective utilization of the influential organization factors derived from this study may eliminate the shortcomings of middle- to high-level managerial personnel in the hospitality industry.
Geography	Over the past 15 years geographers in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere have been increasingly concerned with issues of sexuality and space and have produced an array of work under the heading 'queer geographies'. This paper considers the importance of place in the production of queer geographies. Material representing queer geographies is drawn from Web pages, conversations and e-mail exchanges (a questionnaire survey) with key individuals in geography (or related spatial disciplines) departments in New Zealand and Australia. Complex politics of place mean that queer geographies in Australasia are both similar to and different from queer geographies produced elsewhere.
Political Science	The European Parliament organizes its legislative activities along two chains of delegation to the rapporteurs - one institutional, one partisan. We analyze discretion and agency loss along these chains of delegation from the perspective of party group coordinators who select the rapporteur on behalf of the party group. Do coordinators minimize agency loss towards their national party, their European party group, the committee median or the plenary median when allocating reports? Data from the 2009-2014 legislative term demonstrate that coordinators tend to select rapporteurs who are close to their own national party's ideal point on the integration dimension. This has important implications for intra-parliamentary and intra-party delegation, party group cohesion and broader policy-making in the European Union.
Health Policy & Services	Nigeria launched a 'hub and spoke' decentralization pilot in March 2010 for the provision of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). In this programme, stable ART patients at hospitals (hubs) were referred to primary health care centres (spokes) for the continued provision of ART. The objectives of this study are to compare the cost of ART care provided through the two levels of care. We also assess if decentralization was associated with changes in patients' service utilization. Data were collected from facilities and patient records from Kaduna and Cross Rivers States. Costs were collected from the provider perspective. In Cross River, 398 patients and 528 from Kaduna were included in the retrospective cohort. The analysis utilizes separate fixed effect regressions for each state to assess differences in costs and service utilization among patients that decentralized. Uptake of decentralized services was similar to 3% in Cross Rivers and similar to 9% in Kaduna among active ART patients in April 2011. Patients electing to decentralize had 40% (95% CI: 13% to 67%) higher costs in Cross Rivers and 29% (-44% to -14%) lower costs in Kaduna as compared with patients that did not decentralize. Lower costs in Kaduna appear to result from shifting care to less expensive cadres of health workers (task shifting) rather than decentralization. Decentralization of health services is a complicated process and broad generalizations across settings and processes, concerning whether or not it reduces unit costs, are likely over-simplifications. Similarly, decentralization of ART services does not automatically increase access to ART care, and may limit access to ART laboratory services. This study is limited by not including costs incurred above the facility level, such as training, or costs borne by patients.
International Relations	This article is a response to calls from a number of theorists in International Relations and related disciplines for the need to develop alternative ways of thinking 'the border' in contemporary political life. These calls stem from an apparent tension between the increasing complexity of the nature and location of bordering practices on the one hand and yet the relative simplicity with which borders often continue to be treated on the other. One of the intellectual challenges, however, is that many of the resources in political thought to which we might turn for new border vocabularies already rely on unproblematised conceptions of what and where borders are. It is argued that some promise can be found in the work of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, whose diagnosis of the operation of sovereign power in terms of the production of bare life offers significant, yet largely untapped, implications for analysing borders and the politics of space across a global bio-political terrain.
Industrial Relations & Labor	A study of 13 countries reveals that measures of hours worked based on administrative sources are relatively low while measures based on establishment and labor force surveys are relatively high; thus, although ever improving, these measures cannot yet be taken at face value and are useful only for broad comparisons
Linguistics	This article discusses the problem of accounting for Poznan-Cracow voicing in Government Phonology. It is concluded that in order for the process to be handled representationally, Polish words beginning with non-obstruents would need to carry the element {L} as part of the melody at the leftmost skeletal slot. It is explained that although such a move would make a representational analysis of Poznan-Cracow Voicing straightforward, the presence of the element {L} on non-obstruents is against the tenets of the phonological model. The article is organised as follows. Section 1 presents a selection of voice phenomena in Polish. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts of Government Phonology relevant to the analysis. Section 3 summarises Gussmann's (2007) analysis of voice phenomena in Polish. Section 4 discusses the differences between Warsaw Polish and Poznan-Cracow Polish in terms of voice assimilation. Section 5 briefly summarises two earlier analyses of voice phenomena in Polish that account for Poznan-Cracow Voicing, namely Gussmann's (1992) SPE-type analysis of SEGMENT-TO-CONSONANT SPREADING, and Rubach's (1996) Lexical Phonology (LP) analysis of CRACOW SPREAD. Section 6 presents theoretical considerations of why these two analyses cannot be mechanically translated into GP theoretical machinery. The section also points to the limitations of VOICE ADJUSTMENT with respect to Poznan-Cracow Voicing. Section 7 introduces the flawed idea of enriching the left edge of words with the element {L}, and provides an attempt at a representational analysis of Poznan-Cracow Voicing using the enriched representation. Section 8 discusses the limitations of the analysis, and proposes an alternative approach to the issue. Section 9 summarises the most important conclusions.
Nursing	Purpose: This study was conducted to compare caregiving burden and social support levels of parents of children who have undergone a liver transplant. Designs and methods: This study utilized a descriptive, cross-sectional research design. Data were collected using a parent information form, the Zarit Burden Interview, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Data were collected via face-to-face interview after written consent was obtained from the parents of children who had received a liver transplant. Results: Parent participants were found to have a high caregiving burden and low levels of social support from their surroundings. Parents who experienced change in their work life, social and family relationships, and had economic problems post-transplant, had a higher caregiving burden and may have lower social support. Parents whose children had a transplant from a cadaveric donor and continued to attend school were found to have a lower caregiving burden. There was a negative correlation between parent caregiving burden and social support scores; that is, caregiving burden (R-2= 0.57, p < 0.01) was significantly affected by social support (B = -0.682, beta=-0.757). Conclusions: This study concluded that parents receiving social support may have a lower caregiving burden, and some of their socio-demographic characteristics may have a positive effect on social support and caregiving burden. Practice implications: Health professionals need to pay special attention to the social support and caregiving burden of parents whose children have had an organ transplant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

International Relations	The Internet is an interconnected network and cyber security requires collective action. How that action is organised has important implications for national security, including the defence against cyber attacks and malicious activities. This article explains the origins and institutionalisation of cyber security in Australiaparticularly civilian cyber security'. The authors trace the origin of Australia's first computer emergency response team and explain how this organisational form spread from the USA. Through it, Australia helped enable international cooperation. Domestically, however, the authors argue that the Australian government has struggled with the delegation, orchestration and abdication of responsibility for civilian cyber security, underinvesting in civilian organisations while overrelying on military and intelligence agencies. The history of this organisational field provides valuable insight into how to improve national policy and operations for cyber security.
Sociology	In this study, we examine the relationships among reflected appraisals, self-views, and well-being for individuals diagnosed with severe and persistent mental illness. We also test a perceptual control model of identity to determine whether discrepancies between stigmatized reflected appraisals and stigmatized self-views are associated with self-evaluation (self-esteem and self-efficacy) and psychological distress (depressive symptoms). We find that stigmatized self-views are significantly associated with lower self-esteem and self-efficacy and higher levels of depressive symptoms. Stigmatized reflected appraisals are also associated with lower self-efficacy and higher depressive symptoms but are not associated with self-esteem. As predicted, discrepancies between reflected appraisals and self-views are associated with lower levels of self-efficacy and higher levels of depressive symptoms; however, we do not find a relationship between identity discrepancy and self-esteem. We discuss the implications of our findings for identity and stigma research.

Transportation	This study examines the forms of cruise ports governance, the structures, and strategies that are applied with the aim of matching the needs of a changing cruise industry. Introducing the conceptual 'matching framework' approach of port governance, we study the configurations of cruise ports strategies and structures in the case of the second biggest market of the world, the Mediterranean and its adjoining seas. A database detailing the features observed in cruise ports in 18 different countries forms the backbone of the empirical analysis. Performing a Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA), that seeks correlations between four categories of variables (port type, port location, port structure, and port strategy) and cases, enables to detect whether there are distinctive patterns of governance regimes applied in different groups of cruise ports. The results identify four models, i.e. configurations of the environment-structure-strategy-contextual environment relationship triangle, marked, inter alia, by different roles of the managing entities - active leader, investor, marketer, and passive, respectively-and associated with the different roles of port authorities.

Cultural Studies	Aiwha Ong and Nancy Chen's anthology Asian Biotech (Duke, 2010) wonderfully and incisively captures the initial results of a period of intense investment throughout much of Northeast, South and Southeast Asia in the most recent two to three decades in the emerging biosciences, grouping its collection of papers according to broad thematic clusters. Documenting a series of diverse, changing practices with respect to the use of bodies and human tissues in clinical trials, the related establishment of blood and tissue storage facilities, and even cutting-edge efforts to work with HESC technologies, the volume offers a comprehensive view of a rapidly emerging field in a part of the world that has only recently begun to appear as a major contributor to global techno-scientific activity, with state actors frequently leading the mobilization efforts. Juxtaposed against this thematic content, this review seeks to place the volume in conversation with a longer history, especially existing work in the history of the life sciences, which has until now been dominated by accounts of laboratories primarily based in the West. Rich with implications for a changing ethical practice driven by material changes in medical and scientific practice, Asian Biotech initiates any number of debates to open up a new field of inquiry.
Education & Educational Research	The article presents a longitudinal study of an urban charter middle school to examine the impact testing pressures can have on the education of students with disabilities and English language learners, and how this may lead to a narrowing of the content they are taught. The study examines various sources of data, including the school's evolving language, literacy, and math programs, high-stakes test results, school improvement plans, and written IEP goals. Over several years, as low test scores and failure to make AYP had an increasing impact on school life, skills specifically targeted on annual state tests became the guide for how math and literacy and language development were addressed. In effect, instruction in these areas became equated with test preparation. As ranges in proficiency led to ability grouping in pertinent courses, there was a narrowing of skills addressed in the lower-level classes that were entirely populated by students categorized as limited-English proficient and/or having a disability. In effect, this turned test preparation into the math and literacy curricula for these students, which in turn affected decisions regarding which skills would be addressed in students' IEPs. Implications for schools, policy, and further research are suggested.
Nursing	The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of how parents of children with cancer handle the fear in their children. Fifteen parents of 11 children participated in focus-group interviews. Data were analyzed by a phenomenological hermeneutical method. The results suggest that the parents' handling was equivalent with caring in the best interests of the child. This included striving for the security and well-being of the child up to a certain point where the parents instead used their authority to maintain the child's physical health rather than trying to prevent or relieve the child's fear.

Information Science & Library Science	While virtual reference services (VRS) are becoming more and more common in academic libraries, implementing and maintaining well-used and effective VRS can be a challenge in the face of competing demands on time, staffing, and funding. Between 2011 and 2012, librarians at Washington State University, Pullman (WSU) have overhauled and reorganized VRS, committing more time, money, and energy to VRS than ever before. While past experiences with VRS at WSU Pullman have been mixed, data collected from recent years shows that the decision to prioritize VRS was worth it, leading to a vital and rapidly growing service. VRS at WSU shows sizable increases in usage between 2010 and 2012, indicating that VRS is now a necessary part of the WSU Libraries' mission to best serve their community of users.
Communication	The purpose of this study was to more closely examine the association between avoidance and satisfaction during a potentially conflict-inducing conversation with one's dating partner. The results suggest that the way people respond to their own and their partner's conflict avoidance depends upon whether they are male or female. The perception of one's partner's avoidance and one's own avoidance were only dissatisfying for women. Moreover, although the chilling effect (M. E. Roloff & D. H. Cloven, 1990) was present for both men and women, it only affected women's relationship satisfaction. The results also revealed that the association between conflict avoidance and dissatisfaction was bidirectional for women. For both men and women, the more dissatisfied they were entering into the conversation, the more they avoided during it. Women's avoidance, however, also negatively influenced their relationship satisfaction. Finally, the strength of the associations suggests that satisfaction may have a slightly stronger impact on avoidance than avoidance has on satisfaction.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Background: To investigate the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality in men with musculoskeletal conditions. Methods: Participants were 12,728 men (mean age 47.0 [9.3] y) with a history of musculoskeletal conditions (including joint pain, low back pain, stiff joints, arthritis, osteoporosis, or gout) and were followed for all-cause mortality to December 31, 2003. Fitness was quantified by maximal treadmill exercise test and was categorized for analysis as low, moderate, and high performance. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Overall, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for mortality across incremental fitness categories were 1.00 (reference), 0.45 (0.30-0.68) and 0.35 (0.22-0.53), linear trend P < .01 for all-cause, 0.50 (0.23-1.10) and 0.29 (0.12-0.71), linear trend P = .02 for cardiovascular disease, and 0.38 (0.20-0.74) and 0.40 (0.20-0.80), linear trend P = .01 for cancer mortality. Conclusion: Among men with musculoskeletal conditions, higher fitness is associated with lower risk of death by cardiovascular disease, cancer, or any cause, independent of other risk factors.
Sociology	Differences in health between racial groups in the United States are significant and persistent. Many studies have documented these differences as a result of a variety of different social factors. An emerging emphasis is the impact of racism in its various forms on physical and mental health. Social stress theory conceptualizes racism as a social stresssor which can produce negative health consequences for racial minorities. This study uses binary logit and negative binomial regression models of four items from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to test social stress theory and examine the relationship between stress symptoms from perceived racism and overall health (N = 32,585). The effect of race on the experience of emotional and physical stress symptoms from racism is substantial. Furthermore, experiencing both emotional and physical stress from perceived racist treatment is an important factor in predicting the number of poor mental and physical health days, indicating that the experience of stress from perceived racism is related to overall poorer health.
Development Studies	The spirit of public entrepreneurship', reignited by large-scale and long-term official finance from emerging economies, is now driving a process of creative destruction' in the established systems for governing official development finance primarily forged among advanced economies. In response to this burgeoning official finance from emerging economies once on the margins or outside of these established systems, potentially seismic shifts are occurring in three central governance systemsthe reporting systems for official development assistance in the OECD Development Assistance Committee, OECD export credit disciplines and debt sustainability in the Bretton Woods Institutions. Emerging economies create competitive pressures that work to redress the undue rigidities in these established frameworks, opening the way to meeting vast development financing needs. If not well managed or coordinated, however, growing official finance runs the risk of further rounds of financial arms races and debt crises. To harness the processes of public entrepreneurship' as a force for good in realizing a transformative post-2015 development agenda requires international cooperation to reshape global governance of official development finance.

Business, Finance	This paper examines the trading behavior and decomposes the trading performance of foreign, individual and institutional investors as well as proprietary traders in a dynamic emerging stock market, the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Foreign investors follow a positive feedback, momentum strategy and are good short term market timers but have poor security selection performance in poor markets, thus suggesting that they have a macro (market timing) but not a micro (security selection) informational advantage relative to local investors. Institutions and proprietary traders have poor security selection trading performance. Individuals display herding behavior and have fairly good security selection performance, but individual investors appear to compensate proprietary traders for the provision of short term liquidity by proprietary traders, so individuals' security selection gains are canceled out by market timing losses.

Linguistics	"This paper addresses the syntactic-semantic analysis of an apparently sui generis construction that has so far been detected in Romanian only. The construction, called the ""R(omanian) U(nexpected) R(elative construction)"") has the superficial appearance of a degree-denoting complex DP, except that it lacks the definite article that is typically found in the latter. Despite its indefinite appearance, an RUR has definite semantics and differs semantically from a minimally difference DP that possesses the definite article in that the relative-external NP fails to be presupposed. The analysis proposed in this paper locates the difference between RURs and comparable definite DPs in a formal feature [EQ] that is found in RURs only, and which triggers the interpretation of CP as a function from degrees to restricted intensional generalized quantifiers of degrees."
Ethics	Controversies about time discounting loom large in decisions about climate change. Prominently, a particularly controversial debate about time discounting in climate change decision-making has been conducted within climate economics, between the authors of Stern et al. (Stern review on the economics of climate change, 2006) and their critics (most prominently Dasgupta in Comments on the Stern review's economics of climate change, 2006; Tol in Energy Environ 17(6):977-981, 2006; Weitzman in J Econ Lit XLV:703-724, 2007; Nordhaus in J Econ Lit XLV:686-702, 2007). The article examines the role of values in this debate. Firstly, it is shown that time discounting is a case in which values are key because it is at heart an ethical problem. Secondly, it is argued that time discounting in climate economics is a case of economists making frequent and routine references to ethical values and indeed conduct ethical debates with each other. Thirdly, it is argued that there is evidence for deep and pervasive entanglement between facts and values in the prevalent methodologies for time discounting. Finally, it is argued that this means that economists have given up the 'value-free ideal' concerning time discounting, and discussed how the current methodology of time discounting in economics can be improved.
Environmental Studies	Amazonia is under threat. Biodiversity and redundancy loss in the Amazon biome severely limits the long-term provision of key ecosystem services in diverse spatial scales (local, regional, and global). Resilience thinking attempts to understand the mechanisms that ensure a system's capacity to recover in the face of external pressures, trauma, or disturbances, as well as changes in its internal dynamics. Resilience thinking also promotes relevant transformations of system configurations considered adverse or nonsustainable, and therefore proposes the simultaneous analysis of the adaptive capacity and the transformation of a system. In this context, seven principles have been proposed, which are considered crucial for social-ecological systems to become resilient. These seven principles of resilience thinking are analyzed in terms of the land use planning and land management of the Amazonian biome. To comprehend its main conflicts, challenges, and opportunities, we reveal the key aspects of the historical process of Latin America's land management and the Amazon basin's past and current land use changes. Based on this review, the Amazon region shows two concrete challenges for resilience: (1) the natural system's fragmentation, as a consequence of land use limiting key ecological processes, and (2) the cultural and institutional fragmentation of land use projects designed and partially implemented in the region. In addition, the region presents challenges related to institutional design, the expansion and strengthening of real participation spaces, and the promotion of social learning. Finally, polycentric and adaptive governance is itself a major, urgent need for this region and its social-ecological complexity.
Social Issues	William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience is one of the world's most popular attempts to meld science and religion. Academic reviews of the book were mixed in Europe and America, however, and prominent contemporaries, unsure whether it was science or theology, struggled to interpret it. James's reliance on an inherently ambiguous understanding of the subconscious as a means of bridging between religion and science accounts for some of the interpretive difficulties, but it does not explain why his overarching question was so obscure, why psychopathology and unusual experiences figured so prominently, or why he gave us so many examples and so little argument. To understand these persistent puzzles we need to do more than acknowledge James's indebtedness to Frederic Myers's conception of the subconscious. We need to read VRE in the context of the transatlantic network of experimental psychologists and psychical researchers who provided the primary intellectual inspiration for the book. Doing so not only locates and clarifies the underlying question that animated the work but also illuminates the structural and rhetorical similarities between VRE and Myers's Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death. In contrast to the individual case studies of hysterics, mediums, and mystics produced by others in this network, both Myers and James adopted a natural-history approach in which they arranged examples of automatisms to produce a rhetorical effect, thus invoking science in order to evoke a religious response. Where Myers organized his examples to make a case for human survival of death, James organized his to make a case for the involvement of higher powers in the transformation of the self. Read in this way, VRE marks a dramatic shift from a religious preoccupation with life after death to a religious preoccupation with this-worldly self-transformation.
Ethics	This essay analyzes the recent appearance in Russian letters of ultra-nationalist fantasies about the restoration of Russia's imperial or totalitarian status. This new trend has its roots not only in the increasingly patriotic tone of Russian society and politics, but also in the dynamics of the literary field itself. 'Imperialist writers' such as Aleksandr Prokhanov and Pavel Krusanov have both revived and reacted against postmodern themes and motifs from earlier decades. Relying on the legacy of sots-art and stiob, the 'imperialists' advance a new model in Russia's postmodern tradition, one that is balanced on the very borderline between irony and ideological militancy. In playing the game of ambiguous fanaticism, these writers have been able to attract the attention of a broad and diverse public, and have moved from an intellectual periphery into the cultural mainstream.
Urban Studies	Using a door-to-door approach to integrate inter- and intra-city travel times, this paper simulates the changes in regional territorial and population accessibility, spatial equity, as well as the winner and loser cities resulting from High-speed rail (HSR) network development in the Yangtze River Delta, China. HSR network development has a minimal effect on decreasing the disparity in overall territorial accessibility but leads to an obvious decrease in the disparity in population accessibility. Seven types of winner and loser cities are summarised according to their net winner population and stations locations. Poor access to the city center from HSR stations is a common issue for many cities in the YRD, and more integrated development is needed for future HSR planning and construction.
Management	In the present article, we establish two production inventory models (Model I and Model II) for deteriorating items when the demand rate depends on the instantaneous inventory level. The production rate depends not only on the stock level but also on the demand. In both the models, we consider the Weibull distribution deterioration. Model I is developed and solved without allowing shortages whereas Model II is developed and solved allowing shortages that are backlogged. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the solution procedure of the two models. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Creative tourism is a new genre of tourism eliciting active tourist participation in learning and experiences. This study explores tourists? motivations for participating in creative activities, as well as their perceptions of authenticity following a visit to the Albergue Art Space located in Macau, SAR, China. Empirical results indicate that vernacular heritage, service quality and participatory experience are key determinates for developing creative tourism. Sightseeing, social contact, self-improvement and escape emerge as primary motivations for participating in creative activities. In addition, tourist perceptions of authenticity in the context of creative tourism encompass objective and existential components. This study proposes to incorporate aspects of participatory experience into creative tourism products.
International Relations	Greater uncertainty characterizes Australia's strategic environment. Power transitions in the Indo-Pacific test US primacy at a time when Australia as a major US alliance partner is encountering new asymmetric, society-centric threats from state and non-state actors in what is called the 'cognitive battlespace'. This is a different kind of warfare, utilizing information as military force. Threats take the form of direct manipulation of interconnected, information-rich environments. Securing the national interest from society-centric threats involving the 'weaponization of information', especially of social media and the global corporate platforms upon which they operate, poses considerable strategic, conceptual and technological challenges for Australia's civilian and military cyber-defence agencies. We begin by briefly reviewing the evolution of the strategic culture underpinning Australia's understanding and use of military force, arguing that it is shaped largely by historical insecurity borne from a deeply embedded social sense of isolation and an unquestioned strategic imperative to rely on alliances with 'great and powerful friends'. We give a brief account of Australia's 'last wars' which saw it deploy to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and note the evolving cyber-enabled changes to the battlefield. We then argue that the new cyber-threats target the domestic fabric of liberal democracies and market economies, posing risks to all military and civilian institutions as well as weakening citizens' belief in the values which underpin them. Finally, we examine Australia's evolving integration with US networked cyber capabilities, and legislative and bureaucratic reforms to counter foreign political interference campaigns, asking whether they are sufficient.
Economics	This paper aims at investigating the differences in cost efficiency of the banking industry in Serbia and Montenegro over the period 2005-2012. These two countries operated under a common monetary regime until 1999 and followed two different monetary regimes thereafter: unilateral euroisation in Montenegro and monetary independence in Serbia. A stochastic frontier approach incorporating bank-specific and country-related variables is used to analyze cost efficiency in the banking sectors of Serbia and Montenegro. The analysis shows that a bank operating at given conditions in terms of ownership, market and other specific characteristics presents significantly higher cost efficiency if it operates in Montenegro rather than in Serbia. We argue that this result may relate to the choice of unilateral euroisation made by Montenegro. It is also shown that foreign-owned banks, higher capitalized banks and banks with lower non-performing loans operate at higher cost efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Business, Finance	This paper reviews theoretical and empirical work on financial contracting that is relevant to accounting researchers. Its primary objective is to discuss how the use of accounting information in contracts enhances contracting efficiency and to suggest avenues for future research. We argue that incomplete contract theory broadens our understanding of both the role accounting information plays in contracting and the mechanisms through which efficiency gains are achieved. By discussing its rich theoretical implications, we expect incomplete contract theory to prove useful in motivating future research and in offering directions to advance our knowledge of how accounting information affects contract efficiency.
Education & Educational Research	The conceptions of what constitutes nursing competence and how such competence is taught and learned are changing, due to rapid changes in in the health sector. Nurse teachers' competencies for providing high-quality, up-to-date nursing education, are developing accordingly. This paper reviews the existing research on nurse teachers' competencies and addresses how this research identifies, describes, and conceptualizes these competencies. A rigorous search, retrieval and appraisal process identified 25 relevant studies for inclusion in the review. A thematic synthesis was applied to the findings of the studies and subsequent themes were synthesized. The thematic synthesis of the empirical evidence resulted in the five broad themes: academic, nursing, and pedagogical competencies; attitudes; management and digital technology. However, these separate elements appeared to be highly integrated. Hence, this paper indicates that nurse teachers' competencies may be assessed using a holistic approach, which could bring together the disparate attributes required for successful professional performance in specific situations.
Rehabilitation	Introduction: Mentoring is valuable for the retention of new teachers. This article describes a model statewide mentor program for new itinerant vision professionals who work with students from birth to age 22. The results of a recent survey of satisfaction are reported, along with implications for the field. Methods: The proteges who participated in the statewide mentor program completed an electronic satisfaction survey. Of the 76 participants who had been assigned a mentor during the 2011-12 academic year, 56 responded (74%). Both quantitative and qualitative questions were included in the survey. The quantitative questions were analyzed using percentages, and the qualitative data was analyzed and put into themes using the data analysis process of triangulation. Results: Seventy-one percent of the participants reported having had more than 10 interactions with their mentors over the previous year. The topics most frequently addressed with their mentors were performing evaluations (89%), locating resources (84%), and writing goals and objectives (79%). The most helpful mentoring techniques that were used included guided problem-solving techniques (70%), effective listening (68%), and the provision of teaching materials (57%). The majority of the proteges (82%) thought that their mentors had definitely contributed to the quality of their teaching. The top stressors for new vision professionals were related to organization and time management, evaluations, and collaboration with others. Discussion: The results of the survey demonstrate that the mentor program had a positive outcome for the participants as new educators. It also provided information on the stressors faced by these new vision professionals.
Ethics	Patients have the right to refuse their treatment; however, this refusal should be informed. We evaluated the quality of the informed refusal process in Iranian hospitals from patients' viewpoints. To this end, we developed a questionnaire that covered four key aspects of the informed refusal process including; information disclosure, voluntariness, comprehension, and provider-patient relationship. A total of 284 patients who refused their treatment from 12 teaching hospitals in the Isfahan Province, Iran, were recruited and surveyed to produce a convenience sample. Patients' perceptions about the informed refusal process were scored and the mean scores of the four components were calculated. The findings showed that the practice of information disclosure (9.6 +/- 6.4 out of 22 points) was perceived to be moderate, however, comprehension (2.3 +/- 1.4 out of 4 points), voluntariness (8.7 +/- 1.5 out of 12 points) and provider-patient relationship (10.2 +/- 5.2 out of 16 points) were perceived to be relatively good. We found that patients, who refused their care before any treatment had commenced, reported a lower quality of information disclosure and voluntariness. Patients informed by nurses and those who had not had a previous related admission, reported lower scores for comprehension and relationship. In conclusion, the process of obtaining informed refusal was relatively satisfactory except for levels of information disclosure. To improve current practices, Iranian patients need to be better informed about; different treatment options, consequences of treatment refusal, costs of not continuing treatment and follow-ups after refusal. Developing more informative refusal forms is needed.
Nursing	Problem: Limited knowledge exists regarding the scope practices and implementation from developing countries. This integrative review aims to report research on the scope of FCC practices, facilitators and barriers to the FCC implementation for hospitalised children and their families in developing countries. Eligibility criteria: Qualitative, quantitative, mixed-method studies, reports, systematic reviews and integrative reviews reporting implementation, barriers and facilitators of FCC, published in English between 2008 and 2018, from developing countries were evaluated. Joanna Briggs Institute Appraisal Tools were used for methodological assessment. Sample: Eleven studies from developing countries met the inclusion criteria. Four studies were randomised controlled trials, five were cross-sectional, one was a quasi-experimental while one was a qualitative study. Results: The scope of FCC research focuses on information sharing, family participation, and respect and dignity and FCC implementation focuses on practices and perceptions, measurement and impact of FCC. Both personal and health system facilitators and barriers exist but their influence on FCC implementation is limited. Research on needs of families and hospitalised children is also limited. Conclusion: FCC practice and research are still in infancy stage in developing countries. There is limited understanding on scope of FCC practices, the needs of parents and children, and the influence of facilitators and barriers. Implications: The limited findings reported in this review support the need for international collaboration to FCC to critique FCC research and integrate it with other philosophies such as child and family centred care and child centred care as is the case in some developed countries.

Criminology & Penology	The FIFA World Championships 2006 in Germany have been praised for their positive atmosphere and described as a 'fairy tale'. Yet, more than 9000 persons were arrested. This paper presents an analysis of police tactics and deployments and their relation to the frequency of incidents and the group relations between fans and between fans and police. Data collection was carried out within three host cities in North Rhine-Westphalia in relation to 10 games of the tournament, drawing on a combination of structured and qualitative observational methods. The outcomes are mixed. Group relations were mostly positive, indicated by positive interaction between fan groups; however, frequency of incidents and arrests suggest that the tournament was not as peaceful as the media coverage may have implied. Deeper analyses suggest that legitimate group relations and positive fan behaviour were associated with differentiated policing, carried out in relation to the situational context and the actual risk present.
Sociology	Generalized exchange is a powerful prosocial behavior with a number of individual and collective benefits, but indirect repayment makes it riskier than other forms of exchange, and this risk is reflected in comparatively lower rates of giving in generalized exchange systems. This study tests whether sharing a social identity motivates greater giving in generalized exchange. It also examines important, but often overlooked, differences between two forms of social identity: category-based social identity, which stems from similarities, and group-based social identity, which stems from interactive, interdependent relationships. As predicted, results of a controlled laboratory experiment demonstrate group-based social identity has a stronger impact than category-based social identity on giving in generalized exchange. The findings of this study have important implications for the study of social identity and, more generally, the study of categories and groups. The findings also shed light on ways groups, such as nonprofit and voluntary organizations, may motivate greater generosity in the prosocial process of generalized exchange.
Women'S Studies	The article proposes an intergenerational talking cure with Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) as a model for feminist research and other takes on epistemology aiming at the transformation of not only hierarchical power structures but also dualist epistemology. The debate on the enmeshments of epistemology and power is reframed by connecting it to the third-wave feminist take on new materialism. I show how we can find answers for current debates in the past, if we decide to elaborate some unexpected (genealogical) descends to some fore-fathers and mothers. The cross reading of Teresa's oeuvre together with psychoanalysis sheds new light upon old but reviving issues such as the (new materialist rethinking of the) interconnectedness of materiality/corporeality and textuality in reaction on the preeminence of text in poststructuralism. Thus, emphasizing how twenty-first century (feminist) epistemology is on different levels challenged by the assignment to think inclusively and to surpass the seductive attraction of revolution as annihilation of tradition.

Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Consider a discrete-time insurance risk model with insurance and financial risks. Within period i, the net insurance loss is denoted by X-i and the stochastic discount factor over the same time period is denoted by Y-i. Assume that {X-i, i = 1} form a sequence of independent and identically distributed real-valued random variables with common distribution F; {Y-i, i >= 1} are another sequence of independent and identically distributed positive random variables with common distribution G; and the two sequences are mutually independent. Under the assumptions that F is Gamma-like tailed and G has a finite upper endpoint, we derive some precise formulas for the tail probability of the present value of aggregate net losses and the finite-time and infinite-time ruin probabilities. As an extension, a dependent risk model is considered, where each random pair of the net loss and the discount factor follows a bivariate Sarmanov distribution.
Substance Abuse	Introduction and AimsA 2010 World Health Assembly resolution called on member states to intensify efforts to address alcohol-related harm. Progress has been slow. This study aims to determine the magnitude of public support for 12 alcohol policies and whether it differs by country, demographic factors and drinking risk (volume consumed). Design and MethodsData are drawn from seven countries participating in the International Alcohol Control Study which used country-specific sampling methods designed to obtain random, representative samples. The weighted total sample comprised 11 494 drinkers aged 16-65 years. ResultsDrinking risk was substantial (24% increased' risk and 16% high' risk) and was particularly high in South Africa. Support varied by alcohol policy, ranging from 12% to 96%, but was above 50% for 79% of the possible country/policy combinations. Across countries, policy support was generally higher for policies addressing drink driving and increasing the alcohol purchase age. There was less support for policies increasing the price of alcohol, especially when funds were not earmarked. Policy support differed by country, and was generally higher in the five middle-income countries than in New Zealand. It also differed by age, gender, education, quantity/frequency of drinking, risk category and country income level. Discussion and ConclusionsWe found a trend in policy support, generally being highest in the low-middle-income countries, followed by high-middle-income countries and then high-income countries. Support from drinkers for a range of alcohol policies is extensive across all countries and could be used as a catalyst for further policy action.
Public Administration	The health information needs of people living in rural areas are unmet. We aim to report on the results of the IRIS institutional- and population-level intervention designed to improve access to health information in rural settings. The intervention consisted of three components: equip local libraries with health-related books, train librarians to refer them to locals, and enhance locals' health information seeking behavior, self-efficacy, and health literacy. Data was collected using a mixed-methods strategy of inquiry in 2010 and 2011 from 822 adult inhabitants from four rural communities in Cluj county, Romania, using a nonrandomized control-group pretest-posttest study design. We used the Kruskal-Walis oneway analysis of variance to determine statistically significant differences between the two study groups. Results show that individuals from rural communities included in the intervention group were more engaged in health information seeking, had higher self-efficacy in reading and understanding health-related materials, and reported higher frequencies of asking about and borrowing books on health themes from the village library as compared to respondents in the control group. As the IRIS initiative made use of available community resources and proposed only several incremental changes within the librarian system, this intervention has a major potential of sustainability and replicability.
Gerontology	"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Quality innovation networks"" (QINs"") support of nursing homes (NHs) is a national strategy to systematically improve the quality of care experienced by residents. QINs have been tasked with providing NHs with information, resources, tools, and training to assist in developing best practices and to support quality improvement efforts in infection prevention (including joining the National Healthcare Safety Network [NHSN]), avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, and increase use of hospice and palliative care. Our objective was to examine QIN online resources provided to NHs to support best practices and improvement efforts. DESIGN An environmental scan was conducted. SETTING/MEASUREMENT Each QIN website was evaluated on (1) usability, (2) accessibility and prominence, (3) website design, (4) availability of training materials, (5) recency of update, (6) identification of key personnel, and (8) quality focus areas (ie, infection prevention, NHSN, antibiotic stewardship, reducing unnecessary or avoidable hospitalizations, and palliative and hospice care). RESULTS QIN websites varied dramatically in design and resources offered to NHs as well as in the content and ease of finding information. Antibiotic stewardship and NHSN resources were widely available. Information (ie, fact sheets) on reducing avoidable hospitalizations was commonly available, while resources, such as tool kits, webinars, training, and contact information for personnel on reducing avoidable hospitalizations, were available to 23 states. Infection prevention resources were varied and limited to 34 states. Both palliative care and hospice resources were available through only a few QINs (13 states and 20 states, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Given that much of the information, tool kits, and resources are standardized and in the public domain, centralized resources with tailored or specialized links to unique local resources, like in-person trainings and state-specific contact information, could be more beneficial for NHs."
Education & Educational Research	The article explores the need to eat as a biological and social practice among children in a preschool in Norway. The children in this preschool are aged from one to two years of age, and some of them have just started there. Different events from mealtimes relate to Derrida's concept of touch and Grosz's notion of bodies in-place and out-of-place. How food touches the children and the practitioners is further discussed through a consideration of body/place relations, which are both material and reflect pedagogical discourses. Its overall context is not only touching the food in a concrete sense, but also food as touch seen as a philosophical concept. Analyzing touching relations around the table including movements in materiality, bodies and discourses of eating may empower the youngest children in a preschool setting.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	In both the academic literature and the public imagination, waiting time is often understood as passive, empty and wasted, particularly when associated with institutional or organisational settings. The purpose of this paper is to challenge this limited conceptualisation, by exploring the experiences of asylum seekers who waited between 2 and 9 years in the UK for a resolution of their precarious immigration status in Glasgow, UK. When asked to describe their experiences of waiting, these individuals tended to articulate the dominant notion of waiting as passive, stagnant time spent doing nothing'. Rather than taking such narrative accounts at face value, I consider broader ethnographic material pertaining to their everyday lives, which attests to a more complex lived experience of waiting. I argue that their waiting was affective, involving a heightened anticipation of the future and reflection on desired and dreaded outcomes; active, as they structured and filled their time with a variety of routines, activities and projects; and, in a more limited sense, productive, as waiting time could be transformed into capital. I conclude that for the asylum seekers involved in this research, waiting was not an empty interlude between events but an intentional and agential process.
Health Policy & Services	ObjectiveTo examine the relationship between insurance market structure and health care prices, utilization, and spending. Data SourcesClaims for 37.6million privately insured employees and their dependents from the Truven Health Market Scan Database in 2009. Measures of insurer market structure derived from Health Leaders Inter study data. MethodsRegression models are used to estimate the association between insurance market concentration and health care spending, utilization, and price, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics and other market-level traits. ResultsInsurance market concentration is inversely related to prices and spending, but positively related to utilization. Our results imply that, after adjusting for input price differences, a market with two equal size insurers is associated with 3.9 percent lower medical care spending per capita (p=.002) and 5.0 percent lower prices for health care services relative to one with three equal size insurers (p<.001). ConclusionGreater fragmentation in the insurance market might lead to higher prices and higher spending for care, suggesting some of the gains from insurer competition may be absorbed by higher prices for health care. Greater attention to prices and utilization in the provider market may need to accompany procompetitive insurance market strategies.
Rehabilitation	Introduction Occupational therapists have a key role in supporting people experiencing cancer and its consequences. A complex skill mix is required to fulfil this role, creating a training need for occupational therapists. Method This study retrospectively examined the evolution and sustainability of the cancer occupational therapy interest group, a cancer educational resource for occupational therapists within public health facilities in Queensland, Australia. Development of the programme was reviewed and data were analysed to examine involvement in the programme and confidence in providing cancer services. Results Membership of the interest group, participating locations and videoconference attendances all increased across the study period from 2012-2016. The practice areas participants most frequently reported confidence addressing were fatigue management and palliative care. Participants most frequently reported they were not confident addressing sexuality and relaxation management. Conclusion The cancer occupational therapy interest group provides an approach that demonstrates some utility with providing education and information for occupational therapists in cancer services.
International Relations	In this paper, we demonstrate that dependence on trade influences asymmetric crisis perception. Unilateral crisis perception is more likely to persist when the initiator of the crisis does not depend on trade with the target because in this case the target lacks capability to harm the initiator. Conversely, when the initiator is dependent on trade with the target, mutual crisis perception occurs sooner. Additionally, a state is more likely first to perceive a threat from another statebeginning a crisis as a targetwhen its trade dependence on that state is high. We find support for these expectations in survival time regressions and probit models spanning the period from 1919 to 2001.
Health Policy & Services	Objective To test whether public reporting in the setting of postacute care in nursing homes results in changes in patient sorting. Data Sources/Study Setting All postacute care admissions from 2001 to 2003 in the nursing home Minimum Data Set. Study Design We test changes in patient sorting (or the changes in the illness severity of patients going to high- versus low-scoring facilities) when public reporting was initiated in nursing homes in 2002. We test for changes in sorting with respect to pain, delirium, and walking and then examine the potential roles of cream skimming and downcoding in changes in patient sorting. We use a difference-in-differences framework, taking advantage of the variation in the launch of public reporting in pilot and nonpilot states, to control for underlying trends in patient sorting. Principal Findings There was a significant change in patient sorting with respect to pain after public reporting was initiated, with high-risk patients being more likely to go to high-scoring facilities and low-risk patients more likely to go to low-scoring facilities. There was also an overall decrease in patient risk of pain with the launch of public reporting, which may be consistent with changes in documentation of pain levels (or downcoding). There was no significant change in sorting for delirium or walking. Conclusions Public reporting of nursing home quality improves matching of high-risk patients to high-quality facilities. However, efforts should be made to reduce the incentives for downcoding by nursing facilities.
Family Studies	Previous studies point out that family experience is strongly linked to adolescents' adjustment in school and has a central status in the field of educational sociology. However, the mechanism that operates between parental marital discord and Taiwanese adolescent children's future academic achievement is not clear. The purposes of this study were to examine the impact of parental marital conflict on adolescents' academic achievement and to determine if maternal parenting practices mediated or moderated the impact. Drawing on responses from 931 pairs of Taiwanese mothers and adolescent children, a longitudinal data collection approach using panel design provided repeated measurement of marital discord. Over the course of two years, adolescents reported on their academic achievements and their perceptions of maternal parenting practices while mothers completed questionnaires evaluating marital discord. The results of this study supported a spilled-over effect (partial mediation) model but failed to support a compensation (moderation) model. Overall, marital discord not only had a direct negative effect on adolescent academic achievement but also demonstrated an indirect impact through less desirable and adverse parenting practices with adolescent children.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Understanding the decision-making process and predicting travel behavior are critical for destination tourism marketers. This study develops and tests a structural equation model using the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain Chinese college students' intention to travel to Japan. Ten hypotheses were proposed regarding the relationships between destination image, travel constraints, and the original TPB constructs. The results of structural analyses reveal that the extended TPB has better predictive power for travel intention to Japan than the original one. Attitude is found to have the greatest impact on intention to travel to Japan. The mediating role of travel constraints shows a significantly negative effect on the relationships between the predictors and travel intention except for the relationship between perceived behavioral control and travel intention. The results of this study can help improve marketing promotions and the development of more effective destination positioning strategies for Japanese inbound tourism.
Public Administration	We introduce an ecological Europeanization framework that provides the opportunity to determine the actual size of European and national rule stocks as objective measures of potential sources of external red tape drivers. We illustrate our ecological framework with the case of Dutch competition law for the period running from 1962 to 2010. Applying our framework, we infer the share of European rules in the entire national rule population, thus revealing what part of the national rule stock is Europeanized. We find that all rule stocks in our sample have increased drastically over time. Moreover, European rules have different effects at the national rule stock level, depending on rule type. European rules serve as weak substitutes for Dutch formal laws, and as complements for Dutch secondary rules. We discuss how the ecological method of measuring external law evolution may inform future organizational red tape research specifically, and studies into formalization generally.
Ethics	This article builds upon previous discussion of social and technical determinisms as implicit positions in the biofuel debate. To ensure these debates are balanced, it has been suggested that they should be designed to contain a variety of deterministic positions. Whilst it is agreed that determinism does not feature strongly in contemporary academic literatures, it is found that they have generally been superseded by an absence of any substantive conceptualisation of how the social shaping of technology may be related to, or occur alongside, an objective or autonomous reality. The problem of determinism emerges at an ontological level and must be resolved in situ. A critical realist approach to technology is presented which may provide a more appropriate framework for debate. In dialogue with previous discussion, the distribution of responsibility is revisited with reference to the role of scientists and engineers.
Public Administration	"During the last two decades, scholars have pointed to a process of ""denationalization,"" or the delegation of competencies away from the center of the nation-state-upward, downward, and sideward. At the same time, scholars have observed a transformation of the central state aimed at strengthening its steering capacity by means of integrating sectoral public policies and coordinating administrative units. Little systematic comparative evidence is available regarding this second phenomenon and its relationship with denationalization. The authors contribute to this line of research by presenting a comparative analysis of cross-sectoral reforms concerning public policies and public sector organizations, covering four policy fields in 13 countries, from 1980 to 2014. Using descriptive statistics and Bayesian change point estimation, this article shows that policy integration and administrative coordination reforms configure a powerful trend, which displays considerable variation across time, policy fields, and countries."
Development Studies	This article explores the role of culture and cultural action as a resource for unlocking assets and reducing vulnerability with the view of building long-term resilience in communities. Contextualized by the Small Change asset-based approach and the United Kingdom-based Small Change Forum (SCF) initiative, this article examines how culture embodies valuable resources for building resilience in community groups and ways in which cultural action can unlock and use existing assets in communities to bring about change. The opportunities and challenges for achieving development through cultural action are outlined and principles developed which aim to add to the debate about the role of culture in community development.
Gerontology	Objectives Technology-based prompting has the potential to support people with dementia to complete multistep tasks in the home. However, these devices can be complex to use. This paper reports a feasibility trial of a personalised touchscreen digital prompter designed for home use. Methodology: A tablet-based prompter suitable for people living with dementia was developed, along with a detailed guidance manual. Carers loaded instructions for completing the task onto the prompter, and the person with dementia then used the tablet independently to complete a task. Eleven couples used the prompter 'out-of-the-box' with no support other than a guidance manual. Results The majority of participants with dementia could follow the steps on the prompter, and carers were able to breakdown and load tasks onto the prompter. Eight couples used the prompter successfully to complete goals that they had identified in advance. These included preparing simple snacks and using a TV remote control. Successfully achieving goals was associated with more frequent use of the prompting screen on more days, but not higher levels of editing or previewing of tasks. Conclusion The study provides the preliminary evidence that family caregivers can use a touchscreen tablet, software and manual package to identify specific tasks and break these down into steps and that people living with dementia can then follow the prompts to complete the tasks. This potentially represents an important advance in dementia care. Further testing is required to establish efficacy and to identify any factors that impact on outcomes.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Most studies of decisions to curtail alcohol consumption reflect experiences of abusing drinkers. An exploratory sequential research design is used to explore the applicability of this research to the experience of nonabusing drinkers advised to curtail alcohol consumption after a hepatitis C diagnosis. A qualitative component identified 17 new decision factors not reflected in an inventory of factors based on synthesis of existing scales. Qualitative data were triangulated by supplementing semistructured interviews with Internet postings. A quantitative component estimated prevalence and association with current drinking of these new decision factors. Patients who quit drinking tended to attribute postdiagnosis drinking to occasional triggers, whereas patients who were still drinking were more likely to endorse rationales not tied to specific triggers.
Social Issues	Capitalist dynamics in knowledge production are not limited to situations in which economic interests influence researchers' practices. Building on laboratory studies and the French pragmatic tradition in sociology, this article proposes an approach to tackle more pervasive capitalist logics at work in contemporary research and their consequences. It uses the term epistemic capitalism to denote the accumulation of capital, as worth made durable, through the act of doing research, in and beyond academia. In doing so, it conceptualizes capitalism primarily not as a system of circulation and accumulation of monetary value but rather as a cultural way of producing, attributing, and accumulating specific forms of worth, which need not be monetary. Empirically, the article studies variants in epistemic capitalism by addressing the differing role of the accumulation of different forms of capital and the regimes connected to it in two institutional settings in Austria, academic life science laboratories and biotechnology start-up companies. Concluding, it argues that analytically dissociating the concept of capitalism from its link to economic value allows a finer-grained cultural analysis of the importance and effects of processes of accumulation in contemporary research. It ends with discussing the normative implications of these findings for debates about the commercialization of academia.
Ethnic Studies	"This article places Mexican migration in the context of the longue duree of Mexican-U.S. political and economic relations. We argue that 21st-century migration not only has its roots in the 19th century, but very much resembles its early predecessor. The latest wave of migration is just the most recent iteration of a process of hegemonic dominance over Mexico, a process that has been for the most part ongoing since the late 1800s. It continues to be rooted in labor migration caused by unequal economic policy between the two countries. The paper builds upon the empire theory of migration literature in lieu of the neutral-seeming ""natural'' ""push-pull'' of markets and living conditions or social capital theories, and provides a more power-driven analysis stressing hegemony and domination in which the United States exerts control over Mexico for the purposes of exploiting cheap labor and raw materials."
Social Issues	Research in theoretical lexicography has led to the formulation of various models for the planning and compilation of dictionaries. These dictionaries belong to different typological categories but they should all be regarded as reference sources with a specific data presentation, specific structures and well defined functions. Although directed at the compilation of dictionaries, many aspects of these theoretical models can also be applied to other sources of reference. In this paper it is proposed that the implementation of developments in theoretical lexicography should be extended so that certain types of reference sources other than dictionaries, also fall within the scope of their application. These suggestions may look like an attempted lexicographisation of other reference works. However, they should rather be seen as a proposed delexicographisation of a well developed theory, which is at present restricted in its application to the field of dictionaries. Following a brief discussion of some salient features in the development of theoretical lexicography, especially the lexicographic functions approach, the focus switches to the possibility of planning a more general reference source according to criteria laid down for dictionaries. Due to the lack of a proper theoretical basis, many tourist dictionaries fail to satisfy the needs of their intended target users. Accordingly, as opposed to merely proposing an improved tourist dictionary, this article employs tourist dictionaries as a case in point to argue in favour of a more comprehensive tourist guide that will include the tourist dictionary as one of the texts in its central component. Various aspects of the reference needs of tourists are discussed and an indication is given of ways in which dictionaries can provide in these needs. The transition from a tourist dictionary to a tourist guide is presented as the best solution to the problem of inadequate tourist dictionaries. Various aspects of the relevant adaptation and implementation of lexicographic criteria are discussed. Innovative suggestions regarding the structure of the more comprehensive reference source, e.g. the use of an amalgamated central component in which so-called drawer texts are presented as equal status integrated inner texts, are complemented by a focus on the way in which access to the data on offer in such a reference source could be enhanced It is indicated that, contrary to the prevailing approach in tourist dictionaries, not only a communicative junction but also a cognitive junction should be satisfied by tourist reference guides. In order to achieve this, the access process needs to make provision for a poli-accessible reference source which allows different search routes with a variety of reference source external points of departure to guide the intended target user to a variety of destinations within the reference source, where the external access routes are linked to internal routes. The notion of intra access routes to link different texts within the amalgamated central component to ensure an optimal retrieval of information and to ascertain textual cohesion is introduced In a reference source like a tourist guide, access should not be limited to the source internal data. Users often need to be guided to pragmatic and cognitive destinations outside the reference source. To assist users in this regard, suggestions are made for an exit process, giving access to the source external environment. This form of access activates the use of a further lexicographic function, i.e. the operative function. Information retrieved from the reference source should enable knowledgeable target users to employ it in the pragmatic source external environment in order to satisfy certain needs. The reference source, in this case the comprehensive tourist guide, is elevated to a communicative, cognitive as well as operative access route directed at the real tourist environment. Such an approach helps to fulfil the genuine purpose of the relevant reference source. By delexicographising certain aspects of lexicographic theory its more general application can enhance the quality, accessibility and usefulness of many other sources of reference.
Business, Finance	Using a large sample of executives in S&P 1500 firms over 1996-2010, we document significant salary and total compensation gaps between female and male executives and explore two possible explanations for the gaps. We find support for greater female risk aversion as one contributing factor. Female executives hold significantly lower equity incentives and demand larger salary premiums for bearing a given level of compensation risk. These results suggest that females' risk aversion contributes to the observed lower pay levels through its effect on ex ante compensation structures. We also find evidence that the lack of gender diversity on corporate boards affects the size of the gaps. In firms with a higher proportion of female directors on the board, the gaps in salary and total pay levels are lower. Together, these findings suggest that female higher risk aversion may act as a barrier to full pay convergence, despite the mitigating effect from greater gender diversity on the board.
Ethnic Studies	Over the past decade, cities across the United States eliminated bus service at an alarming rate. This article insists that a persistent association between the urban bus and racial others legitimized these cuts as their surrounding discourses highlighted tensions between the need to move low-wage minority workers from city to suburb to exploit their labor, and the desire to erase them as disposable elements of a neoliberal economy. It argues that this tension inclined politicians and voters in St. Louis, Missouri, and Atlanta, Georgia, to deny increased bus funding despite the prospect of reduced profits for suburban businesses.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article offers an initial exploration of forms of cultural and political agency of Latino youth who experience sexual attraction to both men and women. The authors focus on young people's perspectives about bisexuality, their views and critical responses regarding social categories of sexual identity, and their reflections about the relationships between sexual and gender identities. Following a social constructionist approach, the authors explore sexual identity not as an essence to be discovered in a coming-out process but as a dynamic, interactive process in which the subjects construct their sexual identities in dialogue with existing cultural possibilities and within the context of their social relations. Based on in-depth interviews with 11 boys and five girls from 15 to 19 years old who had Latin American or Caribbean ancestors, the findings show different ways in which these sexual-minority Latino youth participated in struggles over meanings, labels, forms of discrimination, and normalization.
Urban Studies	This article explores the boundaries of neighborhoods as subjectively constructed by 37 adolescents and 33 parents across four census-defined block groups in a Western city. We examine the degree of consensus among participants on the spatial boundaries of their neighborhoods, the stability of participants' subjectively constructed neighborhood definitions, and the overlap between subjectively constructed definitions and census block group and tract definitions. Through an analysis of qualitative interviews, we isolate four factors that appear to influence how participants define their neighborhood boundaries: physical and institutional characteristics of the neighborhood, its class, race, and ethnic composition, perceived criminal threats from within and outside the neighborhood, and symbolic neighborhood identities. These factors can operate to facilitate or compromise consensus and stability about neighborhood boundaries and identity. The study findings are exploratory but suggest several avenues for further investigation into how parents and adolescents construct neighborhood boundaries and the possible influences that subjective neighborhood definitions have on families.

Cultural Studies	Decadence, moral decay and national disintegration are obsessively recurrent themes in the narratives of the French radical right. This article explores the topos of decadence in the Front National's ideology through a content analysis of speeches and campaign material ranging from the 1980s until 2012. Beginning with an interpretation of decadence based on Rene Girard's discussion of persecution-legitimising texts, the article argues that the Front National's discourse on decadence revolves around the idea of a crisis of differences and an acceleration of exchanges presented as unnatural. This point is developed in relation to the role of sexuality in the party's profile and to the logics of historical development and political agency inherent to the Front National's understanding of decadence. Decadence, I argue, is indissociable from indifferentiation - the fear of seeing the disappearance of differences conceived as fundamental for the preservation of national order.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To examine whether tooth loss at age 70 is associated with onset of disability at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-up and to mortality at 21-year follow-up. SETTING: Community-based population in Copenhagen. DESIGN: A baseline study of a random sample of 70-year-old people born in 1914 and follow-up 5, 10, 15, and 20 years later. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 573 nondisabled individuals participated in the study of 70-year-olds in 1984, 460 participated in the 5-year follow-up, 292 in the 10-year follow-up, 150 in the 15-year follow-up, and 78 in the 20-year follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Data from interviews and a medical and oral examination. Oral health was measured according to number of teeth (0, 1-9, 10-19, >= 20). Disability was measured using the Avlund Mob-H scale at age 75, 80, 85, and 90. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Register. RESULTS: Being edentulous or having one to nine teeth was associated with onset of disability at age 75 and 80. Health-related variables and education attenuated the associations between edentulism and onset of disability, although they remained marginally significant, whereas the association between having one to nine teeth and onset of disability remained unchanged and statistically significant at 10-year follow-up (odds ratio = 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-7.24). Persons who were edentulous at age 70 were at significantly higher risk of mortality 21 years later, also in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.03-1.55). CONCLUSION: Tooth loss is independently associated with onset of disability and mortality in old age. The findings indicate that tooth loss may be an early indicator of accelerated aging.
Criminology & Penology	Although all jurisdictions with capital punishment currently have at least one statutory aggravating factor for causing the death of a law-enforcement officer, little is currently known about the fate of these persons. There is a common perception that these individuals would be the most likely to receive a death sentence among those convicted of capital crimes; however, this assumption has not been empirically tested. The purpose of this research was to examine this assumption in the state of North Carolina among the population of offenders convicted of capital murder between the years of 1977 and 2009. Quantitative analysis shows that murdering a law-enforcement officer does not increase the likelihood of a death sentence. Additional qualitative analysis of these cases examines the ultimate fate of these offenders and reveals that the death penalty is reserved for those who either specifically seek out law-enforcement officers, brutalize and degrade them, or kill them in an attempt to avoid arrest or to escape that is either unsuccessful or did not require the murder to succeed in these endeavors. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Development Studies	World biofuel production has been increasing to improve energy security and mitigate global warming. Southern Africa's bioenergy demand could increase with South Africa's planned fuel blending mandates, triggering increased demand for feedstocks and agricultural land. Ensuring sustained production will require a full understanding of the constraints to production expansion, considering the tradeoffs that may be generated in rural areas, as has been observed for large-scale land acquisitions. We analyse the social and biophysical constraints to biofuel production expansion in Zambia. Previously social constraints have received limited attention even though they may prove more problematic. Results indicate that Zambia is at least moderately suitable for bioenergy investments with biophysically suitable areas largely coinciding with the socially suitable areas. However, existing gaps in compensatory procedures may inhibit large-scale projects' access to development finance if not aligned with internationally acceptable practices, and generate negative outcomes if safeguards are not in place.
Law	Over two decades since the copyright misuse doctrine was first recognized in Lasercomb America, Inc. v. Reynolds, a uniform approach for determining whether a specific behavior constitutes misuse still does not exist. Circuit courts have commonly applied two competing approaches to the misuse analysis. One approach centers on the public policy underlying copyrights; the other approach centers on antitrust principles. This Note explores relevant jurisprudence and elucidates the shortfalls of each approach. It then proposes a compromise that underscores the interplay between copyright and antitrust laws. The proposed resolution aims to provide a much-needed uniform misuse analysis that does not overlook the important policies underlying copyright law, or disregard antitrust principles relevant in the context of tying arrangements.
Rehabilitation	The aim of this study was to determine whether an 8-week period of backward walking (BW) training on the treadmill can improve the gross motor function measure (GMFM), weight-bearing symmetry, and temporospatial gait parameters in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy. Twelve participants aged 5-15 years with spastic cerebral palsy participated in this study. The BW training was conducted on a treadmill for up to 20 min, with three sessions per week for 8 consecutive weeks. Before each treadmill training session, lower limb stretching was included in the session. Interlimb differentials of vertical ground reaction force while standing, temporal-distance gait parameters, and scores of dimension D and dimension E of the GMFM were determined. Participants showed statistically significant improvements in a measure of GMFM (P<0.01) and weight-bearing symmetry value (P<0.05), forward walking velocity (P<0.05), and step/stride length (P<0.05 or P<0.01). This pilot study suggests that BW therapy on a treadmill may help to improve walking abilities and other gross motor skills in this sample of patients.

History & Philosophy Of Science	The safety movement in healthcare approaches patient safety mainly by reducing uncertainty to prevent possible errors. This article is concerned with how this approach relates to other modes of conceptualising patient safety. Following the work of Georges Canguilhem, I argue that, depending on how we conceptualise knowing, acting and error, a different mode of patient safety is possible: one that involves 'living with uncertainty'. Through ethnographic research on daily clinical work in Dutch primary care facilities, I show that the assumption that clinical work can be made safe by reducing errors not only is problematic, it also creates new forms of 'unsafety'. My observations at general practitioners' out-of-hours service units and other primary care facilities display a 'continuous stream of knowing and acting' in which care professionals adopt specific practices that avoid contradictions between uncertainty and safety. Although these practices differed in the various locations I studied, there were some common dimensions of 'living with uncertainty'. By problematising the conceptions of safety and errors as antonyms I suggest that a reappraisal is in order, particularly of the notion of errors in healthcare. Keeping and protecting room for errors in a situated way is crucial for knowing and acting in a field riddled with uncertainty and dealing with human life.
Development Studies	Street trader organisations are paradoxical objects of study. Their claims resist being analysed through the right to the city' lens, so contested are rights to inner city spaces between multiple users, not all of them in dominant socioeconomic positions; and so ambiguous is the figure of the street trader, oppressed but also appropriating public space for profit, increasingly claiming, in neoliberalising cities, an entrepreneurial identity. In the aftermath of the 2013 Operation Clean Sweep' (in which the City of Johannesburg unsuccessfully attempted to evict street traders from its inner city), this paper unpacks the politics of street trader organisations: how they organise their constituencies, frame their claims, forge unlikely alliances and enter into disempowering conflicts in engagements with a divisive municipality.
Economics	"Resilience has become an important topic in many social sciences. Numerous individual choices and economic and demographic outcomes are likely to be influenced by people""s resilience. School performance, work absenteeism and burnout, longevity, the quality of sleep and health-risk behaviors such as substance abuse are some examples. Similarly, it is of high policy relevance to understand the determinants of both individual resilience (such as educational, marital and occupational status) and ecological resilience (such as climate change). Empirical work designed to uncover such relationships suffers from the absence of a resilience measure applicable in the context of large data sets. We fill this gap by proposing a specific measure that is characterized by a set of natural properties. After an introduction to the notion of resilience and its attributes, we argue why these conditions have intuitive appeal. Finally, we provide illustrating examples and derive our main characterization result. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
History Of Social Sciences	For want of legislation, municipal architects in small Belgian towns were able to develop flourishing private practices until the Second World War. Their resulting, rather ambiguous, position in between public and private allowed them to influence interwar reconstruction efforts in myriad ways, from sweeping, top-down projects led by the central government to local initiatives. More than has been acknowledged thus far the private practice of municipal architects seems to have influenced efforts to create aesthetically distinctive townscapes. This argument is advanced here with reference to the case of Dendermonde, a town heavily damaged during the First World War.
Education, Special	"This article critiques the treatment of disability as cultural difference by the theorists of the ""social model"" and ""minority group model"" of disability. Both models include all of the various disabling conditions under one term-disability-and fail to distinguish disabilities from cultural differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, or gender differences). Equating disability with cultural difference, they adopt a political strategy of positive identity similar to that used in other civil rights movements. The consequences of this strategy for the disability movement and special education are discussed."
History	"This article seeks to reconstruct the history of a type of cultural practice developed in Argentina between the end of the 19th century and the middle of-the 20th century, which propitiated the production, reproduction and consumption of arguments that assigned historical value to the associates of Jose de San Martin (1778-1850), who is considered the ""Father of the Country"" within the pantheon of the founding fathers of Argentina. Hence, the general objective is to analyze the particularities of the process of constructing the foundational myths of the nation, emphasizing the cult of the ""heroes,"" and exploring the rise of entities in which the feelings of national identity associated with them are enshrined."
Criminology & Penology	This article examines the constitutive role that silence performs in relation to crime; an area of study that remains relatively under theorized in criminological traditions more attuned to examining the noise that those party to the criminal act engage in, rather than the silence they also do. This article seeks to rectify this deficit by considering silence as the absent presence of crime. It outlines a methodological approach for excavating silence and applies it through undertaking a substantive analysis of the silence that perpetrators, control agents, bystanders and victims do.

Development Studies	Gender discourse and scholarship continues to be dominated by Western paradigms, generally leading to an abstract mapping of gender stratification instead of a critical reflection on the very institutions that shape such lines of inquiry. Not unlike Kipling's illustration of the white man's burden, which treats other cultures as 'childlike' and 'demonic', mainstream theories and studies on gender continue to reflect the white woman's burden, which seems to disparage the identity, voice and contexts of women of colour. This article reviews the historical and current roles of white women in white colonial and postcolonial projects. The review is intended to explore and understand reasons which may be currently contributing to doubts about the white woman's burden in the Third World.
Family Studies	This themed issue explores the caring, cultural and emotional labour of migrant mothers in raising their children, highlighting the ways in which their mothering and family practices contribute to creating future citizens in contemporary societies, increasingly characterised by ethnic, racial, religious, cultural and social diversity. A key objective of the themed issue is to probe into the practices, processes and structures shaping migrant mothers' 'kin work', while recognising the family as a site of internal and societal contestation. Kin work highlights the importance of women's culture and care work that takes places across public and private boundaries (di Leonardo, 1984), and also the way in which the link between 'race', racialisation and motherhood encourages particular kinds of mothering practices. The themed issue is multidisciplinary, combining cutting-edge work by leading and early-career researchers. The collection of articles originally emerged out of an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Network, 'Migrant mothers caring for the future' (2013-15).
Health Policy & Services	To assess whether there is a relationship between having quality as an item on the board's agenda, perceived external pressure (PEP) and the implementation of quality management in European hospitals. A quantitative, mixed method, cross-sectional study in seven European countries in 2011 surveying CEOs and quality managers and data from onsite audits. One hundred and fifty-five CEOs and 155 quality managers. One hundred and fifty-five randomly selected acute care hospitals in seven European countries (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Turkey). Three constructs reflecting quality management based on questionnaire and audit data: (i) Quality Management System Index, (ii) Quality Management Compliance Index and (iii) Clinical Quality Implementation Index. The main predictor was whether quality performance was on the executive board's agenda. Discussing quality performance at executive board meetings more often was associated with a higher quality management system score (regression coefficient b = 2.53; SE = 1.16; P = 0.030). We found a trend in the associations of discussing quality performance with quality compliance and clinical quality implementation. PEP did not modify these relationships. Having quality as an item on the executive board's agenda allows them to review and discuss quality performance more often in order to improve their hospital's quality management. Generally, and as this study found, having quality on the executive board's agenda matters.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"Our best sciences are frequently held to be one way, perhaps the optimal way, to learn about the world's higher-level ontology and structure. I first argue that which scientific theory is ""best"" depends in part on our goals or purposes. As a result, it is theoretically possible to have two scientific theories of the same domain, where each theory is best for some (scientifically plausible) goal, but where the two theories posit incompatible ontologies. That is, it is possible for us to have goal-dependent pluralism in our scientific ontologies. This ontological pluralism arises simply from our inability to directly know the world's objects, rather than any particular claims about our cognitive limits, values, or social structures. I then present two case studies in which this possibility actually occurs-one based on simulations and theoretical analyses of constructed causal systems, and one from actual scientific investigations into the proper ontology for ocean regions."
Development Studies	This article investigates the long-and short-term determinants of child nutritional status in the Malawian district of Salima. On the basis of monthly data from July 2004 to June 2012, the study adopts as explanatory variables a set of indicators representative of the following: household food security; maternal and child care; access to and coverage of health services; and health environment and services. Two models are estimated by Ordinary Least Square in order to compare results based on historical series and their trend-cycle, seasonal and irregular components. Findings highlight the value of a multidimensional food security indicator and the relevance of seasonal events and climatic shocks to child malnutrition. Implications for policy relate to the urgent need to arrest the long-term cycle of food insecurity and malnutrition and the differential response of child nutritional status to policies on food and health.
Business	"The institutional uncertainty of many emerging markets challenges the decision making processes of foreign managers and require advanced information gathering and processing activities. Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT) asserts that an adequate information level determines decision effectiveness and thereby firm performance. Although studies integrated OIPT""s contingent perspective, the actual identification of the adequate information processing per se received little attention. In this paper, we examine the optimal fit between the uncertainty levels of foreign firms in China and their information processing activities. We draw on data from 128 foreign firms"" strategic business units (SBUs) in China and unveil that the examined SBUs face substantially different business environments with respect to dynamics and associated information processing requirements. We develop distinct ideal profiles for information processing capacities and assess whether an alignment with the ideal profile results in improved performance. Our study result""s show that the degree of alignment (i.e. fit) between an SBU""s business environment and its ideal information processing profile is positively associated with strategic quality and company performance, empirically confirming OIPT""s central tenet of ""fitting"" organizational information processing capacities with requirements. We stipulate managers to emphasize the ideal information processing profile according to the level of information processing requirement they face. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Anthropology	In mobile social groups, cohesion is thought to be driven by patterns of attraction at both the individual and group level. In long-lived species with high group stability and repeated interactions, such as baboons, individual-to-individual attractions have the potential to play a large role in group cohesion and overall movement patterns. In previous work, we found that the patterning of inter-individual attraction gave rise to an emergent group-level structure, whereby a core of more influential, inter-dependent individuals exerted a unidirectional influence on the movements of peripheral animals. Here, we use agent-based modeling of baboon groups to investigate whether this core periphery structure has any functional consequences for foraging behavior. By varying individual level attractions, we produced baboon groups that contained influence structures that varied from more to less centralized. Our results suggest that varying centrality affects both the ability of the group to detect resource structure in the environment, as well as the ability of the group to exploit these resources. Our models predict that foraging groups with more centralized social structures will show a reduction in detection and an increase in exploitation of resources in their environment, and will produce more extreme foraging outcomes. More generally, our results highlight how a group's internal social structure can result in mobile social animals being able to more (or less) effectively exploit environmental structure, and capitalize on the distribution of resources. In addition, our agent-based model can be used to generate testable predictions that can be tested among the extant baboon allotaxa. This will add value to the existing body of work on responses to local ecology, as well as providing a means to test hypotheses relating to the phylogeography of the baboons and, by analogy, shed light on patterns of hominin evolution in time and space.

International Relations	"This article unpacks the discursive construction of a European ""China Threat"" narrative by European think tanks. We theorise think tanks as crucial actors in the securitising process, especially at the initial stages where ideas and reference frames are formed. Despite having no decision-making authority, think tanks participate as securitising actors in the process of idea formation and bidding, articulating a securitised frame of reference for policy makers. In the case of EU-China relations, we observe an emerging congruence between think tanks and policy makers that engage in a non-linear construction of a ""China Threat"" policy frame. In this article, we review key think tank reports that are circulated through official EU policy channels and deconstruct the assumptions behind the ""China Threat"" discourse. We first argue that, analytically, their securitising attempt is characterised by a distorted representation of Chinese economic activities abroad, including those falling under the Belt and Road Initiative. Second, politically, this narrative produces a distorted notion of European politics where pluralism is weakness and disagreement dissent, promoting a view of the EU where ""responsible"" core countries must contain the periphery""s ""opportunism"". Third, we contend that despite defending ""Europeanness"" as the epitome of human rights and democracy, the securitisation of Chinese FDI rests on othering practices that risk undermining those very ideals. By identifying the problematic undertones of this securitising effort, we call for a fact-based and pluralistic debate on the challenges of Chinese investment and financing for European economies and societies."
Anthropology	This article presents an approach to pictorial-diagrammatic modelling that was developed and used in ethnographic research on a quasi-global, networked cultural arrangement - specifically, hardcore punk. By facilitating visual mapping, thinking, and conceptualizing, this approach constitutes a methodological apparatus - or experimental system' - that helps to bridge the gap between collections of particular, situated ethnographic accounts and the development of a broader analysis of multi-scalar networks of relationships. A specific feature of this apparatus is its heuristic function, whereby research questions and approaches, on the one hand, and development and use of the model, on the other, recursively and mutually inform each other. The article advocates for a more formalized and systematic use of such tools in ethnographic research, and suggests new ways to move beyond ethnography's predominantly verbal and scriptocentric tradition. On a broader level, this retrospective analysis provides an example of the usually opaque, and rarely discussed, process of crafting ethnographic ideas, concepts, and approaches.
Urban Studies	Well over 90 percent of all motorized transportation is fueled by products of petroleum, but the end of such widespread use of oil may be in sight. Among alternative fuels for land transportation, electricity appears to be the most promising, in part because it can be renewably produced and readily transmitted. The inadequacy and high cost of on-board storage of electrical energy present major challenges to widespread deployment of electric traction, and may do so for many years. On-board generation of electrical energy also presents challenges. The third means of powering electric traction is to provide for connection to the electricity grid while in motion. Grid-connected vehicles (GCVs) are an established feature of many cities and of much inter-city transportation, chiefly as electric streetcars, buses, and trains. They may be more highly regarded by users than their counterparts fueled by petroleum products, but they are nevertheless communal transportation, considered to lack the amenity of the private automobiles in which most land-based movement of people occurs. Private electric automobiles could, in principle, be grid-connected for some or all of their journeys, as electric buses are grid-connected. An alternative is to provide public transport that is more like private automobiles. This is generally known as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT), which could comprise relatively small, fully automated GCVs-often known as pods-that carry one to six persons along reserved guideways providing direct origin-to-destination service on demand. PRT could share infrastructure with private electric automobiles, although this may not be an optimal solution. Development of such GCV applications-for freight movement too-may be a more promising strategy than the current focus on improving traction batteries and fuel cells.
Geography	In various every day contexts, maps are used as media supporting orientation, wayfinding, and navigation tasks. To create highly accurate and reliable maps, cartographers must be aware of cognitive effects that occur when people process map information. Interdisciplinary research from cognitive psychologists showed that map graphics lead to spatial distortions in human spatial memory. These distortions can influence human orientation capacities. Recently, it was discovered that grid structures overlaid on maps help to correct spatial distortions in cognitive representations of geographic space. Square grids chunk a map into smaller units (regions). They guide map-viewing behavior, and their regular structure helps map users to recall learned locations of objects more accurately. The effects caused by square grids may also occur when overlaying other common kinds of geometries, such as hexagonal structures. The effects of hexagonal grid structures on memory of object locations were investigated in this map-experimental study. The study design is based on a recall-memory-paradigm, an established method of experimental psychology to measure performance in memory. The results show that hexagonal grid patterns can improve the performance.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Sample members start web surveys but fail to complete them at relatively high rates compared to other modes. Existing theories and empirical findings on unit nonresponse may or may not apply to breakoff. This study contrasts breakoff and unit nonresponse in web surveys through response behavior for the same individuals across different surveys. Nonrespondents to one survey were considerably more likely to be nonrespondents to subsequent surveys, but such consistency in response behavior was substantially lower for breakoffs. There is a degree of transitioning between response behaviors, however, such as nonrespondents in one survey being more likely to be breakoffs than respondents in a subsequent survey, indicative of unmeasured common causes. Limited support for the common cause hypothesis is also found in demographic covariates, yet to a very limited degree; race and gender were associated with both breakoff and nonresponse, and some associations (e. g., year in school) were in the opposite direction. Subjects invited to multiple surveys in a short period of time were more likely than others to be nonrespondents, but were not more likely than others to be nonrespondents, but were not more likely to break off.
Criminology & Penology	Despite a steady decline in sex crime over the past twenty years, new laws, such as residence restrictions, targeting such crime have proliferated. Some scholars have argued that public concern about sexual offending against young children has served as a catalyst for the emergence of these laws. Few studies, however, have empirically tested this claim. To address this gap and to contribute to scholarship on public opinion about crime and justice, this research tests a central implication flowing from prior work-namely, the notion that people with children will be more likely to endorse increased restrictions on where sex offenders can live. Analyses of public opinion data from a 2006 poll of Florida residents suggest that parents are indeed significantly more likely to support such restrictions. Implications of the study for research and policy are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Environmental Studies	This article examines the transfer of knowledge and information in planning processes, particularly those related to Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam. The authors conclude that knowledge transfers are often highly dependent on the actions of individuals, and that the process of knowledge exchange is frequently uncoordinated and fragmented. Planning ideas from elsewhere often provide inspiration for policy makers but these do not often lead to changes in the formulation of policy or practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Ethics	The history of ethics contains many moral faculty theories, which usually are sorted by their metaphysics. The usual suspects include moral rationalism (Richard Price, Kant), moral sentiment theory (Hutcheson, Hume, Smith) and the varieties of ethical naturalism. Moral faculty theories differ importantly upon yet another dimension, on how widely it is distributed. Some, the Platonic elitists (Plato, J.S. Mill, R. M. Hare), suppose that moral truth can be discerned only by philosophical argument. Hence, they ascribe a revisionary task to normative theory, that of correcting nonphilosophers' moral errors. Others, the communalists (Aquinas, Hume, W. D. Ross), hold that the moral faculty is universally distributed. Hence, they hold that normative theory's task is not to revise, but rather to discern and explain the shared moral conception that we all apply in our ordinary moral lives. I here off er arguments to support commonalism.
Social Work	Psychiatric advance directives (PAIN) are legal documents that allow individuals to express their wishes for future psychiatric care and to authorize a legally appointed proxy to make decisions on their behalf during incapacitating crises. PADs are viewed as an alternative to the coercive interventions that sometimes accompany mental health crises for people with mental illness. Insofar as coercive interventions can abridge clients' autonomy and self-determination values supported by the NASW Code of Ethics social workers have a vested interest in finding ways to reduce coercion and increase autonomy and self-determination in their practice. However, PAIN are also viewed as having the potential to positively affect a variety of other clinical outcomes, including, but not limited to, treatment engagement, treatment satisfaction, and working alliance. This article reviews the clinical and legal history of PADs and empirical evidence for their implementation and effectiveness. Despite what should be an inherent interest in PADs and the fact that laws authorizing PADs have proliferated in the past decade, there is little theoretical or empirical research on PADS in the social work literature.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The split-ballot multitrait-multimethod (SB-MTMM) approach has been used to evaluate the measurement quality of questions in survey research. It aims to reduce the response burden of the classic MTMM design, which requires repeating alternative formulations of a survey measure to the same respondent at least three times, by using combinations of two methods in multiple groups. The SB-MTMM approach has been applied to the European Social Survey (ESS) to examine the quality of questions across countries, including the differences in response design and measurement errors. Despite wide application of the SB-MTMM design in Europe, it is yet unknown whether the same quality of survey instruments can be achieved in both a different cultural context and in a logographic writing system, like the one in Taiwan. This study tests for measurement invariance and compares measurement quality in Taiwan and Denmark, by estimating the reliability and validity of different response scales using the SB-MTMM approach. By using the same questions as in the ESS, a cross-cultural comparison is made, in order to understand whether the studied response scales perform equally well in Taiwan, compared to a European country. Results show that quality estimates are comparable across countries.
Economics	We propose a dynamic model in which firms compete to produce sequential and cumulative innovations, and in which the more firms do research in one sector the more likely it is that one of them innovates. Firms choose research effort and whether to patent innovations or to use an Open Source license like the General Public License. We show that (i) patents generate a larger stationary reward but foreclose research within a sector, and that (ii) Open Source generates a smaller stationary reward but allows everyone to use the technology, and therefore, by attracting firms to the sector, it induces a faster pace of innovation. We characterize all the equilibria of the model and show that in equilibrium an Open Source sector appears only after a proprietary sector. We also find conditions under which the model has a unique equilibrium, in which a proprietary and an Open Source sector coexist and compete in the short run, but the Open Source sector dominates the industry in the long run. We use our model to study whether patents are inefficient, and to explain firms' behavior in the software and the biomedical industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
History Of Social Sciences	This article examines three New World democratic capital cities - Washington, Ottawa and Canberra - where the growing number of public memorials has spurred the development of official plans and policies to regulate the siting and design of future memorial proposals. The historical evolution of these strategies is examined in relation to the designs of individual memorials. The analysis identifies a range of planning strategies that significantly influence the design of individual memorials, including large-scale memorial precinct plans, the social meanings of surrounding sites and structures and existing memorials, and the uses of memorial sites for activities other than grieving. The article examines controversies surrounding the siting, design, meaning and public use of a number of specific memorial examples. The research draws upon existing planning and briefing documents, wider public and professional discourse, and site analysis.
Communication	The 2011 Japanese earthquake and subsequent malfunction at the Fukushima nuclear power plant occurred at the apex of a complex crisis of nature. While some commentators claim that the Fukushima malfunction was the result of a 'natural disaster others situate the event within a broader context of human interventions in ecological and natural systems. Exercised through the global mediasphere, these environmental language wars are formed within crisis conditions and a crisis consciousness that have extensive genealogical roots. This article examines the crisis of nature in terms of contemporary and genealogical language wars that are embedded in a cultural politics of apocalysm. In particular, the article problematises the concept of 'nature' in terms of the disaggregation of human and non-human life systems. It argues that this disaggregation confounds the cultural politics of life (-death) systems, leading to excessive violence on the one hand, and Romantic idealisation on the other. The article recommends a reconceptualisation of nature that implicates all humans and human desires across the global mediasphere.
Women'S Studies	The present study sought to examine whether drinking motives (i.e., coping, social, conformity, and enhancement) moderated the relationship between physical, sexual, and psychological dating violence victimization and alcohol-related problems in a sample of drinking college women (N = 177). Results demonstrated that coping and social drinking motives moderated the relationship between sexual victimization and alcohol problems; conformity, social, and enhancement drinking motives moderated the relationship between alcohol-related problems and physical victimization; no significant findings were evident for psychological aggression victimization. Our results partially support the self-medication model of alcohol use, and this may be particularly relevant to sexual victimization.
Demography	This study explains trends in occupational injury rates among migrant and native workers in Taiwan and evaluates the results of related regulatory protection policies for migrants between 1998 and 2011. Results indicate that the relative occupational injury rate between migrant and native workers dropped from 2.1 times to 1.1 times during the whole period; on average, the injury rates for migrant workers were 1.45 times higher compared with non-migrants. Although policies protecting migrants' rights may have resulted in lower injury rates, the minimum wage policy has otherwise given rise to an increase in injury rates. We argue that governmental regulations regarding the monitoring and management of migrant workers' safety have been only loosely enforced under the guest-worker policy.
Political Science	Historical analogies serve to polarise. If one takes them literally, they seem inappropriate. At the same time, they can point out parallels. In spring 2006, when Radek Sikorski, then the Polish defence minister, cast plans for the construction of the Baltic pipeline in the tradition of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, a storm of indignation broke out in Germany. The Polish media, for the most part, saw the matter more calmly. Even if the pipeline plans do not lead to a partition of Poland, the analogy has drawn attention to the fact that the project also has a political dimension.
Health Policy & Services	Factors contributing to Pakistan's poor progress in reducing reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) include its low level of female literacy, gender inequity, political challenges, and extremism along with its associated relentless violence; further, less than 1% of Pakistan's GDP is allocated to the health sector. However, despite these disadvantages, Pakistani researchers have been able to achieve positive contributions towards RMNCH-related global knowledge and evidence base, in some cases leading to the formulation of WHO guidelines, for which they should feel proud. Nevertheless, in order to improve the health of its own women and children, greater investments in human and health resources are required to facilitate the generation and use of policy-relevant knowledge. To accomplish this, fair incentives for research production need to be introduced, policy and decision-makers' capacity to demand and use evidence needs to be increased, and strong support from development partners and the global health community must be secured.
Demography	Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we examine whether and how the health benefits of having two biological parents in a continuous marital relationship vary by maternal nativity and ethnicity, comparing UK-born White mothers with: (1) White mothers born in wealthy countries; (2) ethnic minority mothers from South Asia; and (3) ethnic minority mothers born in Africa. Making novel use of classification and regression tree (CART) methods, we examine whether marital status is a uniform marker of economic advantage or better health-related behaviours across the four maternal nativity and ethnic groups. The findings, which indicate that the health-related advantages associated with parental marriage are not uniform across the four nativity and ethnic groups, have implications for future research on family gaps in well-being and the socio-economic determinants of health.
Gerontology	"Using ethnographic data collected from a Swedish nursing home, this article analyzes residents' everyday or subtle influence attempts relative to the maintenance of institutional routines. Residents' efforts to carve out some autonomy or fulfill personal preferences in everyday matters could be categorized as (1) disruptions, (2) disturbances, or (3) ""good matches"" relative to ongoing and up-coming nursing home routines. Striking disruptions were often fruitless, while attempts rendered as disturbances were typically postponed or modified. In general, the outcomes of residents' maneuvers were shaped by brief and situational negotiations of whether (and how) temporary exemptions from the institutional order were deemed accountable or not by the staff. Although the staff sometimes arranged situations in which residents were given some defined or symbolic decision-making authority, the findings of this study show how an inflexible local routine culture can constitute a constraining and only occasionally porous framework for residents' self constructions and everyday life.

Environmental Studies	This review is written for climate experts dissatisfied with current approaches for contributing to societal responses to climate change via their interactions with publics. We review the origins and contemporary manifestations of the deficit model, showing that it is the underlying basis for how experts imagine and conduct their interactions with publics. Rather than simply raising awareness among experts concerning their role(s) in perpetuating the deficit model, we use experts and their assumptions to organize our synthesis. Our review will challenge climate experts by demonstrating that educative approaches are inadequate if their goal is to influence behavior by publics. We demonstrate that experts' prevailing means of contributing to socioscientific controversies are crippled, not by public indifference or ignorance, but by experts' allegiance to the assumption that information transfer can prompt behavior change. The transfer of climate experts' knowledge by itself has little chance of changing publics' behaviors. It may be that such approaches work with people already disposed to the information or who defer to experts, but it is unlikely to affect publics who are doubtful, those whose livelihoods are precarious, or those who do not want to consider the terrifying implications of climate change. We propose relationship building as an alternative that can avoid resuscitating the deficit model and its inherent problems. We argue that, to have the impacts that they are seeking, experts will need to negotiate their ends honestly, admit the values driving those ends, and coproduce the means that can accomplish the collaboratively chosen ends. This article is categorized under: Perceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Communication Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge
Management	The Deutscher Werkbund association was born in Munich, Germany, in 1907 with the scope of promoting a new culture of industrial labour' in which the costs of production, craftsmanship, methods and production time of each product would be carefully studied, in order to produce goods of the highest possible quality, given the materials available and the economic constrictions present. Its main focus, then, was on a standardisation of products, production and quality. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the Werkbund anticipated modern day standards of quality, as specified in the ISO family and the SA 8000, and that it was the first real theorisation of the concept of quality management. A comparison is made between the Deutscher Werkbund principles of quality, as formulated in 1907, and the quality management standards of the ISO and the social accountability standards of the SA 8000 series as formulated in the last two decades of the twentieth century. The many important similarities that emerge from this comparison show that the Deutscher Werkbund was an important historical and cultural antecedent to the ISO 9000 and SA 8000 series.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In this article, we illustrate the command distrate, which calculates age-standardized rates with efficient interval estimation by using formulas developed by Tiwari, Clegg, and Zou (2006, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 15: 547-569) as a modification of the method proposed by Fay and Feuer (1997, Statistics in Medicine 16: 791-801). This method is currently used in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland; the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (Associazione Italiana Registro Tumori, AIRTUM); and the Lombardy Mesothelioma and Sinonasal Cancer Registry in Northern Italy. The command produces a compact output and allows for the possibility of specifying a rate multiplier, for instance, x100,000 or x1,000,000. Furthermore, rates and confidence limits can be easily exported to an external dataset for further processing (for example, for making graphs). The command distrate is a useful addition to the official Stata command dstdize.
Education, Special	The aim of this study was to determine the information and communication technologies use in school activities of two groups of students with physical disabilities, comprised of those who did and those who did not use a computer-based assistive technology device (ATD) and to make a comparison with students from the general population. In addition, positive factors associated with in-school computer use are identified for students with physical disabilities. The method adopted was a cross-sectional survey about computer-based activities in school among students with physical disabilities (n = 287); including those who used (n = 127) and those who did not use (n = 160) a computer-based ATD in school (mean age 13 years 6 months). Group comparisons were made with students from the general population (n = 940). The results showed that the most frequent computer users were students with physical disabilities, who used a computer-based ATD daily. However, when considered as a group, students with physical disabilities used the computer for less varied educational activities than the reference group. Four factors had a positive association to 'participation in computer activities in school' for students with physical disabilities: attending a mainstream school, the students' age (notably, being 16-18 years old), using a computer often in school, and the teachers using a computer frequently in teaching. The present study concludes that, regardless of whether they use a computer-based ATD or not, students with a physical disability have restricted participation in some computer-based educational activities in comparison to students from the general population. An individual plan could be beneficial for each student to: focus on the aim of the computer use; examine the students' needs in terms of computer-based ATDs and their inclusion in education; and ensure that the students' digital skills are fully utilised.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The literature on childbirth organisations focuses on their critique of medical definitions of birth practices, their efforts to promote 'natural' or 'normal' birth, their espousal of choice rhetoric and their relationship to feminism. It says little, however, about the practices these organisations use to achieve their aims. Our study of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and France explores the centrality of knowledge-based activities to childbirth activism. Through these activities, we show, organisations (i) elicit the emergence of a concerned public through constituting evidence about women's experiences of childbirth and obstetric practices; (ii) produce evidence about obstetric practices from women's perspectives; (iii) articulate this vision of obstetric practices with a critical appraisal of scientific literature; and (iv) make visible international networks of actors who share similar concerns and conceptions. Drawing upon our empirical data we propose the notion of evidence-based activism in order to capture the specificity of birth organisations' modes of engagement and to describe what they bring about. Through evidence-based activism childbirth organisations get involved in policy making and become recognised as legitimate stakeholders; reframe the issues at stake; open debate with other stakeholders; and bring about changes in the health system. Knowledge-based activities also shape the missions and objectives of the organisations.
Education & Educational Research	This paper positions the photographic image of the self (the 'selfie') as the reflexive indicator on which students are prompted to reveal their learning behaviours, and uses this mode of reflexivity to construct a qualitative study of engagement in a higher education setting. The study leverages the intensified processes of self -reflection created by the novel forms of convergence across the social landscape in which the selfie is embedded, to reveal how oppositional and indexical selfie-reflective practices can operate to uniquely connect behaviours to learning in this sector.
Family Studies	"This article is based on a Franco-German collective research project on family memories that has been conducted at the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) of Paris over the past five years by a dozen of young German and French researchers and coordinated by the two authors. Based on an empirical study of eight family monographs, method inspired by the anthropology of kin relations, this article traces the process that has led us from the analysis of family memories toward the analysis of the production of history(ies) within and through kin groups. It is the Franco-German comparison, but also the necessity to interrogate the concepts of family and history/memory which has led us to propose an original approach of family memories, ultimately leading to a dissatisfaction with the conceptualization we started with. The term ""family memories"" suggests simultaneously the existence of a group (the family), common souvenirs (collective memories), and underlines their difference to history (produced by professionals). This triple definition finally reveals being little useful for this research, since we have rather tried to investigate ways in which individuals and groups, linked through relations of kinship, produce histories through reappropriations of stories constructed and transmitted within several institutions. It is the practices of kin relations, common or contradictory discourses, communicated and linked through emotions, which will produce these (hi-)stories. These multidimensional interactions and configurations contribute in turn to the production of history."
Social Issues	The aim of the study was to predict support for social equality among individuals of high social status based on socio-psychological variables. The study was conducted on a sample of highly-educated Croatian citizens (N=332). The results confirmed the predicted hypotheses. Perception of higher social status instability, greater social inequality, larger potential for making social changes, and higher egalitarian values predict stronger support for social equality. Relation between status instability and equality support is partially mediated by perception of greater social inequality. Perception of material threat contributes to support for social equality both directly, by enhancing a motivation for ensuring own future, and indirectly, by evoking a perception that others have similar needs. The results provide an insight to unexplored determinants of social solidarity among high status groups and give some guidelines how to draw citizens' attention to the importance of social support programs.
Transportation	The safety, ease of use, and independent use of three wheelchair securement systems and three different types of wheeled mobility devices (WhMD), including a manual wheelchair, a powered wheelchair, and a three-wheeled scooter, were evaluated by eight vehicle operators of a large accessible public transit vehicle (LATV). The securement systems included a forward-facing four-point tiedown system, a prototype forward-facing autodocking system, and a prototype rear-facing-wheelchair passenger (RF-WP) system. The eight LATV operators transported wheelchair-seated passengers in each wheelchair securement system, after which they completed a questionnaire. Operators responded generally positively to the autodocking and RF-WP systems because they were observed by the drivers to be quicker and easier to use and allowed more independent use by wheelchair-seated passengers compared to the four-point tiedown system. From all three securement systems, operators favored the forward-facing autodocking system, because no assistance from operators is required to use it and most users preferred the forward-facing orientation in the vehicle. The autodocking system was perceived to be safe and easy to use by wheelchair- and scooter-seated passengers. These study results promote the need for alternative and improved securement systems that can be used by wheelchair and scooter-seated passengers that travel in LATVs in forward- or rearward-facing directions. Ideally, future securement solutions should not require assistance from LATV operators for their operation and should allow wheelchair- and scooter-seated passengers to ride public transportation safely and independently.
History	This article examines the masculinity of metal workers in the post-WWII era of reparation and radical societal change in Finland. Young men from agrarian communities took on employment in metal industry jobs in droves after WWII. In this paper, metal workers' masculinity is explored in three areas: (a) the transitional period when young men took their first steps in the shoes of metal workers; (b) defining the personal territory of work; and (c) the men's physical capacity to bear their strenuous work. The sources we draw on are the metal workers' work-life stories and workplace narratives in which they write about their personal experiences of work and their attitude about the trade. According to our analyses, metal workers' culture was a double-edged sword. Male workers respected the skills, strength, and autonomy of their trade, but the work in itself and the habits and informal norms of the masculine industrial culture were often harmful to their health. Hence, although the masculinity of the post-war industrial era helped these men to overcome daily difficulties and to find collective strength when needed, masculinity was also connected to risk-taking, and even with illnesses and premature death.
History Of Social Sciences	Using a historical-institutionalist framework, this paper discusses the emergence and evolution of transnational cooperation initiatives in post-war Europe. A number of critical junctures can be identified at which different goals and approaches were introduced. Due to the path-dependent nature of institutional arrangements, this has resulted in increasingly fuzzy rationales and contradictory objectives for transnational regions in Europe today. The paper concludes with a reflection on the value of historical institutionalism to identify the malleability of such complex policy concepts and the key challenges that transnational regions are facing due to unresolved tensions in their policy design and evolution.
Demography	As a follow-up to our 2016 study, this article presents new findings examining the relationship between same-sex family structure and child health using the 2008-2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). After discussing NIHS data problems, we examine the relationship between family structure and a broad range of child well-being outcomes, including school days lost, behavior, parent-rated health, emotional difficulties, and activity limitations. We find both similarities (school days lost, behavior, parent-rated health) and differences (emotional difficulties and activity limitations) across our two studies using different survey years, but our overall conclusions are robust. We further discuss the implications of our findings for future research on this topic, including how to account for biological relatedness in a study on child health in same-sex families.
Management	This study provides insight into the reality of university-industry technology transfer through the assessment of some of the most influential factors for success or failure in research contracts. This widespread mechanism of technology transfer is examined in the light of exhaustive information and experience gathered from 30 interviews with qualified university researchers. The interviewees, who have been directly involved in collaborative projects with industry partners, have deeply described both sound and unsatisfactory cooperation cases, in order to explore which relevant circumstances have led to success or failure. The analysis drives to conclude that there are some features ( beyond technological ones) related to the corporate partner's strategic and functional characteristics, which come to be decisive for success. For example, company's real interest and involvement during the technology transfer process, its capacity to assimilate new knowledge and a confident attitude towards the university research group are identified to be key elements for attaining an effective technology transfer. In this contribution, the importance of these aspects is contextualised and summarised in a model for successful technology transfer.
Sociology	Analyses of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Supplemental Homicide Reports show that southern whites are much more likely than northern whites to be victims of gun homicides and assaults, but not other homicides and assaults. While blacks are more likely than whites to be victims of gun assaults (regardless of region). they have lower risks of assault victimization by unarmed offenders. The patterns are inconsistent with the subculture of violence thesis. In addition, incident analyses reveal that patterns of weapon use primarily reflect the race of the victim not the offender. Our results point to the importance of adversary effects: Offenders avoid assaulting blacks and southern whites unless they have guns because members of these groups are perceived as a greater threat. We suggest that the prevalence of armed assault in a community may lower the likelihood of unarmed assaults, and that honor culture explanations may be salvageable. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Sociology	Previous research has established an association between residential segregation and violent crime in urban America. Our study examines whether school-based segregation is predictive of arrests of juveniles for violent crimes in U.S. metro areas. Using Census, Uniform Crime Report, and Common Core data for 204 metro areas, a measure of school-based racial segregation, Theil's entropy index, is decomposed into two components: between- and within-district segregation. Findings reveal evidence of a significant interaction term: Within-district segregation is inversely associated with arrests for juvenile violence, but only in metropolitan areas with higher than average levels of between-district segregation.
Cultural Studies	This article explores the figure of the good time girl as generated through discussions of young women's sexualities in popular media platforms in Kenya. The article locates itself within a socio-historical space in which sexuality has always been debated through a dominant moral economy embedded within religious and traditional structures. It seeks to answer questions around how, within such a context, the figure of the good time girl can be understood in contemporary Kenya. In this regard, the article considers competing meanings of the good time girl within and beyond the inscriptions of heteropatriarchal ideals that attempt to normalize and fix the sexual identities of young women in Kenya. The article uses the broad template of the good time girl, as articulated in African popular culture, to try and understand the differing ways in which the sexualities of young women, particularly those attending university, are publicly debated and represented in the Kenyan media. The work is framed around scholarship on sexuality and gender in Africa. Methodologically, the work draws on theories of popular culture that emphasize how new genres constituted through new forms of addressivity constitute new publics, enabling possibilities for accessing meaning in new ways.
History	Until now, the struggles against colonial domination in the 1940s and 1950s have primarily been analysed as a face-to-face confrontation between the metropoles and their colonies. This paper proposes a change in scale and analytical angle, by focusing on how African women combined the imperatives of national liberation and internationalism, and used the international arena to structure their local struggles, as well as to circumvent male domination and cope with repression by the French. More precisely, the aim is to trace the history of contacts and exchanges between women from French West Africa (women from Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Mali, among other countries) and the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), founded in Paris in 1945. The WIDF is still not very well known, but it was the largest international women's organisation in the 1950s in terms of the number of members. Based on colonial archives, the WIDF's monthly newsletter and published testimonials, we investigate the influence that the WIDF may have had on African women and especially the use that they made of their ties with the federation in order to organise women's militant sections that were autonomous but dependent on the men of the Rassemblement democratique africain (RDA), the African Democratic Assembly, which was the main opposition party to the colonial authorities at the time. This paper deciphers the presence of these women in the WIDF's international congresses, their modes of action, and the references and values that they adhered to. It applies a threefold perspective of the history of women and gender, transnational history and connected history.
Environmental Studies	This paper analyzes the decoupling states between CO2 emissions and transport development in China from 1994 to 2012. The results indicate that, at the aggregate level, the Chinese transport sector is far from reaching the decoupling state. Negative decoupling or non-decoupling years account for 72.2% of the study period. At the disaggregated level, the decoupling states between CO2 emissions and eight primary fuels are as follows: raw coal and coke are in the absolute decoupling state; crude oil, gasoline and diesel are in the weak negative state; and the other three types (kerosene, heavy fuel oil, and natural gas) are in the strong negative decoupling state. Policy implications underneath the identified decoupling states are also revealed to help China build a more sustainable transportation system.
History & Philosophy Of Science	In an age of genetic medicine, ethnic groups are increasingly being labeled at risk for chronic diseases. Biomedical and genetics research studies have had a significant impact on Native Americans' perceptions of diabetes risk. Ethnographic interviews with 53 Native Americans were conducted in a tribal community that has participated extensively in studies of diabetes. Tribal members had varying reactions to research labeling them at risk genetically for diabetes, from fatalism to motivation for changing diet/exercise habits. Interviewees spontaneously discussed the 'thrifty genotype' hypothesis in diverse ways. Some felt Native Americans had 'weak genes' that made them 'poorly adapted' to modern society's diet, while others stated that Native Americans had 'survival genes' that historically helped them thrive in harsh environments. Interviewees used genetics as a metaphor for expressing vulnerability in the face of a challenging history that resulted in rapid changes to Native American lifestyles. Interestingly, some tribal members saw biomedical research as a tool to help them 'adapt' to the modern world. Collaborative research may provide tribes with unique opportunities to actively address the diabetes epidemic. Researchers' and healthcare providers' descriptions of diabetes risk have important implications for how community members perceive their ability to prevent or manage the disease.
Environmental Studies	Small-island states face a unique challenge. Their natural beauty, an asset as a tourist attraction, hides the fact that they have fragile ecosystems, vulnerable to climate change. They often rely on imported fossil fuel, even if they may have a potential for renewable energy. High population density may be an additional burden. A new paradigm for their development is necessary. The case of Mauritius as a sustainable island (Maurice Ile Durable or MID) is analyzed with focus on energy, considering intrinsically-related engineering, economic, environmental and ethico-socio-political dimensions. A holistic action plan is proposed for a transition towards a sustainable future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Social Issues	This paper reports on a study that explored the experiences, perceptions and motivations of a new type of autonomous volunteer emerging in modern society, in particular, those working to assist in the rural resettlement of refugees in Australia. The volunteers filled a gap left by under resourced government and community services. In-depth semi structured interviews revealed that their motivation was due in part, to the lack of bureaucratic' red tape'. Their drive to address social issues was based also in part on values to see social justice expressed in their community. Some challenges and tensions due to cultural differences were identified. Questions for community development and social capital are raised. Implications are raised for volunteer groups' and resettlement organisations' policy and practice to enhance the resettlement process for both the host community and those with a refugee background.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The Miscellanea Curiosa, sive Ephemeridum Medico-Physicarum Germanicarum, the learned periodical published in different German cities under the aegis of the Academia Leopoldina Naturae Curiosorum, contained many cases of an anatomical nature. The Miscellanea Curiosa in its first years actively participated in the development of anatomia practica, the anatomical practice of observing the signs of diseases in cadavers and connecting them to what had been observed at the bedside. The illustrations that accompanied the post-mortem reports published in the Miscellanea Curiosa allow one to assess the evolution of the pathological illustration itself. This article is thus intended to serve as a contribution to the rediscovery of the origins of this visual genre. A learned journal like the Miscellanea Curiosa, which appeared regularly, provided an ideal venue for the process of accumulating, cross-referencing and - in the final analysis -selecting, serializing and systematizing the knowledge that would form the foundations of modern pathology, by providing a wealth of evidence and images observed at the dissection table.
History & Philosophy Of Science	We study set algebras with an operator (SAO) that satisfy the axioms of S5 knowledge. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for such SAOs that the knowledge operator is defined by a partition of the state space. SAOs are constructed for which the condition fails to hold. We conclude that no logic singles out the partitional SAOs among all SAOs.
International Relations	In the literature on civil conflicts, federalism is often touted as a useful institution to address regional demands. However, diversity in the groups present in a country is also associated with a higher tendency for conflicts. In this article we examine how the geographic distribution of groups across a country affects the ways in which federalism contributes to conflict resolution. Of tantamount importance in assessing these effects of federalism is whether particular types of distributions of groups across a territory make the adoption of federal institutions more likely. We find federal countries with strong ethno-federal arrangements to be particularly conflict-prone.
Women'S Studies	"Gender relations and conceptions of the future in books by the physician and ""voelkish"" activist Mathilde Ludendorff (1877-1966) In her books, Das Weib und seine Bestimmung/Woman and Her Destination (1917) and Erotische Wiedergeburt/Erotic Rebirth (1919), the German physician Mathilde Ludendorff (1877-1966) argued for a social and sexual reformation of gender relations. In so doing, she developed conceptions of a future characterized by equal gender relations and expressed her utopian spirit with regards to the possibilities for change. A comparative analysis of first prints and reprints of her books shows how she changed her ideas in the 1920s, when she became involved with the ""voelkish movement"" and came to define gender-relations and gender equality in racist-antisemitic terms. This shift in Ludendorff's conceptions of the future, towards a ""voelkish-national feminism"", can be seen as one example of how radical developments in the Weimar Republic promoted the rise of National Socialism."
Transportation	This study investigates an integrated optimization problem on the three main types of resources used in container terminals: berths, quay cranes, and yard storage space. It presents a mixed integer linear programming model, which takes account of the decisions of berth allocation, quay crane assignment, and yard storage space unit assignment for incoming vessels. In addition, since the majority of the liner shipping services operate according to a weekly arrival pattern, the periodicity of the plan is also considered in the model and in the proposed algorithm. To solve the model on large-scale instances, a column generation (CG) procedure is developed to provide a lower bound for the integrated problem, in which an exact pseudopolynomial algorithm is designed for the pricing problems. Using this procedure, we propose a CG-based heuristic with different solution strategies and apply dual stabilization techniques to accelerate the algorithm. Based on some realistic instances, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the algorithm. The results show that the CG-based heuristic can yield a good solution with an approximate 1% optimality gap within a much shorter computation time than that of CPLEX.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Portugal did not participate in World War II but was one of the first countries in the world to receive penicillin for civilian use. The Portuguese Red Cross began to import the antibiotic from the United States of America in 1944 and appointed a controlling committee to oversee its distribution, due to the small amount available. In 1945, as world production increased, penicillin began to be distributed through the normal channels. An important role in its regulation was played by the official department responsible for controlling pharmaceutical and chemical products in Portugal, the Comissao Reguladora dos Produtos Quimicos e Farmaceuticos (Regulatory Committee for Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products). Penicillin was imported as a raw material from 1947 and the first medicaments containing penicillin, prepared in Portugal, were released into the commercial circuit in 1948. A laboratory had been established in 1942 by the Comissao Reguladora for the analytical verification of medicaments and medicinal products with the aim of certifying their quality and minimizing the number of products with no attested therapeutic efficacy. The number of medicaments analysed by this laboratory increased substantially from 72 in the year of its foundation (1942) to 2478 in 1954, including, after 1948, medicaments containing penicillin. The aim of the present paper was to elucidate the role of the Comissao Reguladora dos Produtos Quimicos e Farmaceuticos in regulating and controlling the distribution of penicillin in Portugal during the 1940s and 1950s.
Communication	This study introduces and evaluates the robustness of different volumetric, sentiment, and social network approaches to predict the elections in three Asian countries - Malaysia, India, and Pakistan from Twitter posts. We find that predictive power of social media performs well for India and Pakistan but is not effective for Malaysia. Overall, we find that it is useful to consider the recency of Twitter posts while using it to predict a real outcome, such as an election result. Sentiment information mined using machine learning models was the most accurate predictor of election outcomes. Social network information is stable despite sudden surges in political discussions, for e.g. around elections-related news events. Methods combining sentiment and volume information, or sentiment and social network information, are effective at predicting smaller vote shares, for e.g. vote shares in the case of independent candidates and regional parties. We conclude with a detailed discussion on the caveats of social media analysis for predicting real-world outcomes and recommendations for future work.
Law	The modern legal framework for the protection of the mentally ill was conceived and developed in the nineteenth century. A substantial growth in the numbers of the mentally ill revealed an absence of effective and accessible legal protection for the property of patients with small estates. This challenge was met through the retention and reform of the ancient jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor in the Lunacy Court as the sole instrument of protection. The judicial solution was adopted in preference to bureaucratic regulation, despite the strong forces of state intervention and the reform of the legal system and its processes.
Management	Extant research has characterized a firm's search for external knowledge in its innovation activities as either relational or,transactional in nature. The former implies that a firm chooses and develops collaborative relationships with knowledge sources like universities, customers or suppliers, while the latter suggests transactions governed by markets for technology. We argue that prior literature has ignored that both search strategies are interrelated and complementary: adopting one strategy has a higher marginal return on innovation performance if the other one is present. Moreover, we suggest the benefits from complementarity to be higher when a firm is more distant to the technological frontier in the industry and when markets for technology in that industry are shallow. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 3921 German firms from 2001 to 2009 and find support for our hypotheses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Criminology & Penology	After declining for over two decades, homicides in the United States rose sharply in 2015 and 2016. We dissect the homicide rise by characteristics of the victims, offenders, and incidents and devote special attention to the similarities and differences in homicide growth by race. The results indicate that the upturn was demographically and geographically pervasive and encompassed multiple event circumstances. Regardless of whether the 2014 to 2016 homicide spike was a short-run aberration in the long-term crime drop or augurs an extended increase in lethal violence, it should be explained. We offer some general directions for explanatory research on the homicide rise.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This ethnography-based research article explores the negotiation of well-being and subjectivity for youth workers in a Faith-Based Organisation (Canterbury Youth Services [CYS]) in Christchurch, New Zealand. We highlight the emergent significance of the Clifton StrengthsFinder psychometric assessment as a biopolitical mechanism, operating to actualise vocational identities and optimise 'life and health' of CYS leaders, in response to burnout and other salient threats to 'collective human vitality'. We demonstrate how StrengthsFinder contributes to the governing and responsibilisation of youth workers through a call to heightened self-reflexivity, interacting with existing faith practices. We suggest the concept of 'moral labour' as the most appropriate term to describe the active participation of individuals in their own subjectification through a combination of managerial and spiritual techniques. We highlight the paradoxical value of this neoliberal/managerial tool of introspection and personality auditing to the growth of spiritual identities.
Linguistics	This study investigated Korean heritage language (KHL) learners' foreign language classroom anxiety, reading anxiety and writing anxiety using the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) by Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope, the Foreign Language Reading Anxiety Scale (FLRAS) by Saito, Garza and Horwitz and the Writing Apprehension Test (WAT) by Daly and Miller. Sixty-one KHL students enrolled in a heritage-track second semester Korean course at a large university in the southwest USA participated. The results showed that the KHL students generally showed low or moderate levels of foreign language anxiety and reading anxiety and a relatively high level of writing anxiety. In addition, the FLCAS had highly positive correlations with the FLRAS and the WAT, indicating that students who had high anxiety about foreign language learning in the classroom also had high levels of reading and writing anxiety. All three types of anxiety correlated negatively with student achievement, that is, students with high anxiety had lower grades. Moreover, significant differences existed between two groups based on perceived cultural ethnicity, indicating that KHL students who identified themselves as Korean showed significantly lower levels of anxiety and had higher grades than KHL students who perceived their cultural identity as American.
Social Issues	The need for the higher education process to be economically efficient, together with the need for equity and equality in access to higher education services for everyone represents the starting point of this paper. The analysis was conducted using data from a survey on a random sample of young people who recently finished their education using three criterion variables: completion of the study, study success, and the speed of study completion. These variables were chosen because all three individually and in total indicate the efficiency of the process of higher education, but taken together with the data about students and their form of study, other costs of study, family socio-economic background, and eligibility for indirect state financial assistance, also indicate the problems of equality in access to public higher education in Croatia. The obtained results show that the chances for completion of the study are primarily related to the socio-economic status of students. Completion is especially low for students from lower socio-economic strata who do not pay tuition fee, which suggests that the existing instruments of financial aid for non-academic costs are not sufficient for this group. The speed of study completion is primarily influenced by the costs students have to pay for tuition, lower socio-economic status of the students, and eligibility for financial aid conditioned by the dynamics of the study (scholarships).
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Traditional methods of evaluation are limited in their ability to answer key questions often of interest to process evaluators, such as heterogeneity in the ways individuals adopt new programs. In this article, we demonstrate how a statistical approach, Latent Class Analysis, can help improve the quality of process evaluations and illustrate its use in an evaluation of an educational technology integration program in a large school district. In this illustration, we were interested in detecting variability in the ways teachers adopted the new program. We defined classes based on a set of innovative teaching strategies associated with educational technology. Results showed five distinct subgroups of teachers, based on level of program adoption. Results also demonstrate that specific school support strategies (professional development and personalized computing devices) facilitated program adoption. These findings can help to inform individualized support for teachers to optimize the ease and quality with which they are able to adopt new skills in the classroom.
Information Science & Library Science	Connecting academic libraries to the higher education environment is crucial for demonstrating the impact of libraries on student success. The purpose of this study is to examine the information transfer between the disciplines of library and information science (LIS) and higher education in order to evaluate the influence of ideas between the two disciplines. Information transfer was analyzed in 39 articles focused on the library's contributions to student success by examining the cited references, the author and collaborator affiliations, and the forward citations. The findings from the cited reference analysis suggest that LIS is borrowing concepts and methods through citations from the discipline of education. Authorship affiliations showed that some non-LIS authors are publishing in the field of LIS and that LIS authors are collaborating with non-LIS authors. Finally, based on the forward citations, other disciplines are rarely citing LIS research about student success. This article's findings highlight the need to consider research and collaborators outside of the LIS field when researching the library's contribution to student success.
Development Studies	"This article investigates the regionally varied changes in social support and responsibilities of large-scale farms vis-a-vis household plot holders and their rural communities in post-Soviet Russia. Ongoing marketisation puts pressure on the Soviet-inherited symbiosis between large farms and household plots. We observe that large farms"" shift to Anglophone-style, explicit Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) hides declining support for villagers and sometimes even dispossession. In the second of our two case studies, a less well-endowed region, the inherited symbiosis continues with modifications (implicit CSR) and helps sustain comparatively higher household plot production."
Business, Finance	Using a unique online currency transactions dataset, we examine the performance, trading activity, drawdown, and timing abilities of individual currency traders. Evidence from 428 accounts during the 2004-2009 period shows that currency traders earn positive abnormal returns, even after accounting for transaction costs. Additionally, the results reveal that day traders not only trade more frequently than non-day traders, but also outperform them in terms of raw, a passive benchmark and risk-adjusted returns. Finally, sorts on trade activity, measured as the mean number of trades per day per account, and account turnover, show a positive association between performance and trade activity.

Demography	This short paper presents the trends in legal separation in Italy by marriage-cohort and duration, and discusses future prospects. To catch a glimpse of the future of legal marital dissolution in Italy, the authors: (i) project the probabilities of legal separation by duration; (ii) perform a territorial analysis of the twenty Italian regions, suggesting the possible explanations for territorial differences; (iii) compare Italy and Spain (where divorce became legal in 1981), and examine the situations in other western countries, where marital dissolutions became widespread earlier (USA, UK, and France). Many clues suggest that legal separation will becoming increasingly frequent over the coming years for all marriage cohorts.
Health Policy & Services	Policy makers, health professionals, research leaders, and funders in academia and industry interested in healthcare have a major current challenge. What to do about personalizing healthcare in the face of twin pressures from increasing costs of healthcare and major restraints on national and international funding? The encouraging evidence is that investing now is likely at least to reduce many aspects of per person costs of healthcare, in some cases with evidence for associated improvement in clinical outcomes, and with potential for added value for society from the impact on national economies from innovation in biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other health industry sectors. In this paper, we discuss opportunities to accelerate the discovery and development both of safer and more effective medicines, and their companion diagnostics, through personalizing medicines by new pharmacological approaches, combined with innovative chemical biology, (C) 2012 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

Communication	Purpose - How can governments and survivors prepare for and manage natural disasters? Post-disaster reconstruction researchers advocate that community involvement is needed to help survivors recover effectively. This study aims to propose that cooperative goals between government officials and survivors develop guanxi relationships and constructive controversy wherein survivors voice their opinions to aid disaster recovery. Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted the critical incident technique (CIT), which has proved especially useful for studying complex issues, as well as site-intensive research for interviews and participant observation. After developing a local reputation and rapport by working in a residential resettlement area for two months, an author used the CIT to ask 118 survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake to describe specific incidents when they interacted with government officials about recovery issues and then to rate survey items that measure independent and dependent variables. Findings - Results, including structural equation analyses, support the reasoning that cooperative goals between government and survivors facilitate guanxi and constructive controversy, which in turn produced effective disaster recovery, as indicated by survivors' social support, satisfaction, reduced stress and beliefs that government officials led effectively. Research limitations/implications - The data are self-reported and subject to biases and may not be accurate. Practical implications - In addition to developing theoretical understanding, the results can have important practical implications for strengthening relationships and constructive controversy between government and survivors. Social implications - Results suggest that communities have practical ways to prepare for disasters. Structuring cooperative goals among survivors, encouraging guanxi relationships, and training in constructive controversy should promote effective recovery fromnatural disasters. Originality/value - The paper develops theory and research on how leaders can promote community involvement for effective disaster management. The paper proposes that high-quality interpersonal relationships, also referred to guanxi, and the open-minded discussion of opposing ideas, labeled constructive controversy, are major components of effective community involvement. The paper adds to the literature by empirically documenting the utility of the Western-developed theory of cooperation and competition and the concept of constructive controversy for understanding the effectiveness of government leadership for disaster recovery in China.
Political Science	Policy diffusion studies often invoke explanations that draw on the directional pressures for emulation, whether top-down, horizontal, or bottom-up. This article develops a theoretical framework that accounts for the multidirectional features of diffusion, including sub-national, cross-national, and international mechanisms, through the illustrative case of Brazil's federal adoption of Bolsa Escola (School Grant Program), a conditional cash transfer program that preceded the internationally acclaimed poverty alleviation program called Bolsa Familia (Family Grant Program). Using process tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure.
Education & Educational Research	The question of teaching a standard written algorithm for the four arithmetical operations in the first years of elementary school is increasingly raised as a consequence of the possibility of using calculators, tablets, and computers. This article first presents arguments both against and for maintaining this teaching in the first school years. Then, it presents an analysis of the procedurewhether it implies the standard algorithm or notused by second grade students to solve a subtraction verbal problem. The 4720 students involved in the research were divided in a control group (n=2101) and an experimental group (n=2619) in which the standard written algorithm (SWA) was taught, or not taught, respectively. The effectiveness of algorithm use was analyzed not only in terms of accuracy of the answers, but also for its influence on the choice of the correct arithmetical operation and for its choice by the students as a function of their ability. The SWA was strongly associated with the use of the false arithmetical operation (effect size phi=0.79)addition instead of subtractionbut was chosen by students of all levels of ability. The latter result suggests that the SWA is well suited for the most advanced students but far less for the others who use it mechanically and without reflection.
Business, Finance	In this paper we analyze the relation between dominant institutional control and earnings informativeness in a sample of non-financial Spanish firms listed on the electronic market over the 1996 to 2009 period. Our results suggest that, when a bank is the firm's dominant owner, increasing his ownership stake beyond the minimum level needed for effective control provides an alignment of interest between the bank and the minority shareholders, what positively affects earnings informativeness. Nevertheless, when the dominant owner is an investment fund, increasing his ownership stake beyond the minimum level needed for effective control reveals the investment fund's desire to obtain greater control premiums when he leaves the firm, what negatively affects earnings informativeness. Our results are consistent with differences in objectives, stability, scrutiny and visibility of both banks and investment funds when they own the effective control of the firm.
Health Policy & Services	"Polio eradication, like all eradication efforts, is a gamble. If it fails, much of the money spent will have been wasted. If it succeeds, the world will reap a dividend. Success or failure and the magnitude of the dividend depend on a long chain of ""weakest links."" In this paper I identify these links and explain how the chain can be strengthened. A crucial vulnerability is the current plan to halt vaccination using the live-attenuated oral polio vaccine in the post-eradication era. This weakest link can be strengthened by efforts that lower the cost to poor countries of vaccinating with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine.

Development Studies	This article considers whether, and if so how, rural communities can be supported, through a facilitated process, to create social enterprises within the field of health and care. Using results from the thematic analysis of four community case studies involved in a facilitated action-research process, the article identifies community capabilities and entrepreneurial skills needed to create such rural community-based service providers. The identification of similarities and differences in how the development process took place in four communities allows us to present a development model of our facilitated process. The article contributes to understanding about rural community social enterprises for service provision and the processes associated with their creation.
International Relations	This paper seeks to enrich understandings of middle-power security strategies by examining countries that lack great-power capabilities but still aim to influence the regional security environment. Based on a literature review highlighting the functional and behavioral approaches of middle power diplomacy, we note that these elements could also apply to their regional security strategies. The paper focuses on regional security strategy as a subset of foreign policy and asks why some middle powers appear to go for a regional security strategy that is more functional while others adopt a strategy that is more behavioral. It argues that this divergence derives primarily from differences in resource availability and strategic environment. An analysis of Indonesia, South Korea, Australia and Vietnam highlights how each of these middle powers has adopted a particular regional security strategy, driven by their resource availability and strategic environment.
Management	Performance excellence in higher education institutions (HEIs) requires the management of the capabilities related to research, programme design and delivery, and service performance. The capabilities that relate to these three dimensions of HE are numerous, but the resources required to manage these capabilities are usually limited. The key capabilities required for performance excellence must be determined as a part of systematic management. Mapping out the key capabilities, however, is not easy given the unique context of each HEI and subjective perceptions of those involved in determining the key capabilities. This article provides a structured framework for mapping out the key capabilities - required for performance excellence - through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The framework allows the integration of diverse viewpoints, is consensus-based, and allows input to, and ownership of, the decision-making process and its outcomes. The application of AHP is demonstrated through a case study.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Issue addressed: This paper describes how a notorious central Sydney housing estate nicknamed 'Suicide Towers' became the first public housing estate to achieve the World Health Organization criteria for designation as a Safe Community. Methods: A case study was the method of choice to report on the way Government and non-government agencies worked with tenants in a community development approach. Results: The Neighbourhood Advisory Board formed at Northcott worked collaboratively with tenants, Big hART, Government and non-government organisations to make Northcott a safer place to live. This resulted in improved social cohesion, improved environments and a decrease in violent crime. Most importantly, tenants reported feeling more valued, much safer and more comfortable since the project started. Conclusions: Although the arts are not often considered part of the community development process, the use of the art of story telling was the catalyst for the regeneration of this notorious housing estate. In addition, the criteria required for Safe Community accreditation provided an infrastructure within the Northcott Housing Estate for Government and non-government agencies to work with the Northcott community to establish the inter-connectiveness necessary to turn this community into somewhere that the residents felt safe and were proud to be part of.
History	Lojze Ude (1896-1982) is best known for his journalistic and scientific work dedicated to the fight for the northern border (1918-1920) and the uneven struggle for survival of the Carinthian Slovenians. During World War II, he decided to cooperate with the resistance movement and later on also joined the partisans. Nevertheless his affiliation to one camp did not cloud his critical attitude towards the wartime conditions that were marked by fratricidal conflicts. To resolve this situation, Ude decided to mediate between the two Slovenian camps so as to negotiate a truce. Since he had the full confidence of his acquaintances in both warring camps and was regarded as a man of high credibility, Ude was the ideal person to assume this role. Through his mediation, truce negotiations were to take place between the representatives of the Liberation Front and the Slovenian People's Party in the summer of 1943. However, all attempts to negotiate truce, held in the strictest secrecy, failed to break the deadlock. Upon this realization, Ude expressed his feelings with the following words, My work of the past few months that has also been done in the spirit of the aspirations of the Liberation Front, has thus come to an end Further mediation is pointless. In the spiritual atmosphere of illegality, utterly ridiculous secrecy and most demagogic garrulity, hatred and general mistrust, it is impossible to get all the information and much less to find out what has or has not been reported to the intended address. It is also impossible to know how and to whom one should communicate the information one has obtained With this report I hereby cut the Gordian knot of this last thought. This bitter experience of mediation after which Ude decided to join the partisans represents the failure of the most serious attempt to negotiate truce between the two camps in Slovenia during World War II.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The Minimalist Program in generative linguistics is predicated on the idea that simplicity is a defining property of the human language faculty, on the one hand; on the other, a central aim of linguistic theorising. Worryingly, however, justifications for either claim are hard to come by in the literature. We sketch a proposal that would allow for both shortcomings to be addressed, and that furthermore honours the program's declared commitment to naturalism. We begin by teasing apart and clarifying the different conceptions of simplicity underlying generative inquiry, in both ontological and theoretical capacities. We then trace a path towards a more robust justification for each type of simplicity principle, drawing on recent work in cognitive science and in philosophy of science, respectively. The resulting proposal hinges on the idea that simplicity is an evolved, virtuous cognitive bias-one that is a condition of our scientific understanding and, ultimately, of successful scientific practice. Finally, we make a case for why minimalists should take this proposal seriously, on the one hand; and for why generative linguistics would make for an interesting case study for philosophy of science, on the other.
Development Studies	Today three-quarters of the extreme poor live in middle-income countries. There is a clear link between growth and income inequality in large middle-income countries, making poverty and associated problems increasingly a distribution issue. Livelihood studies - through a holistic perspective on how poor people organise themselves a living - have made a significant contribution in the past two decades to our understanding of processes of inclusion and exclusion and thus of the root causes of poverty and marginalisation. The greatest challenge now is translating livelihood studies into social protection policies that countervail social exclusion.
Public Administration	Contemporary public-serving organizationsboth government and nonprofit organizationsface increasing pressure to be innovative and adaptable amidst ongoing global changes. However, existing frameworks of strategic management are generally inadequate in managing the tensions between conflicting imperatives to be adaptable and innovative while providing stable and reliable services. In addition, existing strategic frameworks generally assume that strategic processes are dominated by a group of top decision makers. In contrast, public-serving organizations operate under growing legal and normative expectations to involve a diverse range of participantsindividuals and organizationsin the strategy process. In this paper, we propose that complexity science offers promise in providing a theoretical framework that describes inclusive strategic processes that are associated with both innovation and emergent order. To more fully understand the potential contributions of complexity science, we provide an introduction to complexity science and compare and contrast it to the existing frameworks that currently dominate research on strategic management in public-serving organizations. We then describe and illustrate how complexity science informs our understanding of strategy content, formulation, and implementation and its implications for inclusive management practices.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The relationship between Critical Tourism Studies (CTS) and Asian tourism research is worthy of research. In particular, the challenges that CTS offers to Asian tourism scholarship and how the latter expands the scope of critical thought are areas for consideration. CTS deconstructs mainstream concepts and theorizations and gives voice to the marginalized in the real world of tourism industry and also in the research domain of knowledge creation. How CTS and Asian tourism scholarship are mutually implicated is considered through six exploratory questions relating to principle, language, authorship, concepts, emancipation and pedagogy. Drawing on select literature in Asia, the criticality of extant studies is examined and meaningful directions for further critical scholarship charted. The ultimate goal is to work towards a Critical Asian Tourism Studies (CATS) in which the mutually reinforcing relationship between Asian tourism scholarship and CTS is celebrated, and where research on Asian tourism can be made more theoretical, inclusive and emancipative.
Development Studies	The measures put into place to mitigate the COVID-19 health crisis around the world have disrupted global supply chains and sent commodity prices tumbling. We argue that, while the nature of the COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented, the unfolding consequences for primary commodity export-dependent economies are not. By developing a state-centred adaptive supply chain resilience framework and drawing on past experiences, we identify three impact channels that are specific to commodity exporters: a price, a supply chain and a financial channel. Taking Ghana as a case study, we show how the interplay of these three channels can be particularly damaging.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	We consider alternatives to poststratification for doubly classified data in which at least one of the two-way cells is too small to allow the poststratification based upon this double classification. In our study data set, the expected count in the smallest cell is 0.36. One approach is simply to collapse cells. This is likely, however, to destroy the double classification structure. Our alternative approaches allows one to maintain the original double classification of the data. The approaches are based upon the calibration study by Chang and Kott (2008). We choose weight adjustments dependent upon the marginal classifications (but not full cross classification) to minimize an objective function of the differences between the population counts of the two way cells and their sample estimates. In the terminology of Chang and Kott (2008), if the row and column classifications have I and J cells respectively, this results in IJ benchmark variables and I + J - 1 model variables. We study the performance of these estimators by constructing simulation simple random samples from the 2005 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages which is maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We use the double classification of state and industry group. In our study, the calibration approaches introduced an asymptotically trivial bias, but reduced the MSE, compared to the unbiased estimator, by as much as 20% for a small sample.
Business	The majority of studies on absorptive capacity (AC) underscore the importance of absorbing technological knowledge from other firms to create economic value. However, to preserve moral legitimacy and create social value, firms must also discern and adapt to (shifts in) societal values. A comparative case study of eight firms in the food industry reveals how organizations prioritize and operationalize the societal value health in product innovation while navigating inter- and intravalue conflicts. The value-sensitive framework induced in this article extends AC by explaining how technically savvy, economic value-creating firms diverge in their receptivity, articulation, and reflexivity of societal values.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	We extend the twofold small-area model of Stukel and Rao (1997; 1999) to accommodate binary data. An example is the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), in which pass-fail data for mathematics of students from US schools (clusters) are available at the third grade by regions and communities (small areas). We compare the finite population proportions of these small areas. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model in which the first-stage binary responses have independent Bernoulli distributions, and each subsequent stage is modeled using a beta distribution, which is parameterized by its mean and a correlation coefficient. This twofold small-area model has an intracluster correlation at the first stage and an intercluster correlation at the second stage. The final-stage mean and all correlations are assumed to be noninformative independent random variables. We show how to infer the finite population proportion of each area. We have applied our models to synthetic TIMSS data to show that the twofold model is preferred over a onefold small-area model that ignores the clustering within areas. We further compare these models using a simulation study, which shows that the intracluster correlation is particularly important.
Information Science & Library Science	"Today's life is not insulated from different kinds of ""change."" Change is also experienced in organizations as a somehow daily process. Academic libraries are organizations which need to be active in confrontation with ""change"" because of their essential role in education and research. These libraries could be more successful in meeting users' information needs, if they manage change in a planned manner. In this regard, Iranian academic libraries are not exceptional. They are faced with pressures from their internal and external environments, which make it essential for them to respond and implement necessary changes. In order to assist these libraries in overcoming challenges stemming from change and improvingthe change management capacity in libraries, this article aims to select an appropriate change management model for Iranian academic libraries. After reviewing the literature, finding and selecting basic change models including Kotter's Change Model, Penfold's Information Services Framework for Managing Change, and Curzon's Cycle of Change, a research questionnaire was designed and answered by a group of experts using the consensus method. The results were analyzed by Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques including Technique for Order-Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Simple Additive Weighting Method (SAWM). Penfold's Information Services Framework for Managing Change received the highest scores from the application of both techniques. It is concluded that Penfold's Information Services Framework for Managing Change could be applied as an appropriate change model in the context of Iranian academic libraries."
Information Science & Library Science	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and assess the awareness and extent of the use of social networking sites (SNSs) by the students and research scholars of universities of North India. Design/methodology/approach - The study is a questionnaire-based survey on the usage of SNSs among the students and research scholars of the universities of North India. The data of the study were collected through questionnaires, which were personally distributed to the identified population, i.e. undergraduate students, postgraduate students and research scholars, by the authors. The survey was based on a sample of 610 questionnaires; of which, 486 questionnaires were received, having a response rate of 79.67 per cent. Findings - The study showed that all the respondents were found to be aware of and making use of such applications in their academic affairs. It was revealed from the study that Facebook is the most popular SNS by all categories of respondents. To determine the purpose of SNSs, it emerged that SNSs are mostly used for entertainment and communication. The study also found that the majority of respondents were aware about the security aspects of SNSs. It signifies that excessive time consumption and fear of misusing personal information were the major hurdles in the way of accessing SNSs. Research limitations/implications - The study covers the students and research scholars of select universities of North India. It also signifies the use of SNSs in their research and academic environment. Originality/value - The paper provides reliable and authentic data. The study is worth, justifiable and enlightens the salient findings on the topic, which will be very useful for researchers in this area.
History Of Social Sciences	The recent, joint inscription of Le Locle and La Chaux-de-Fonds on the World Heritage List (2009) offers an interesting example of public use of planning history within the context of a heritage-making process. The notion of ` watchmaking town planning' that was coined for the Unesco campaign of these two Swiss cities suggests that a fundamental unity existed between their planned spatial organization in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries and the social organization of their industrial communities. The paper questions this narrative by discussing the interpretation of a specific planning document -the 1835 scheme for La Chaux-de-Fonds drafted by Ponts-et-Chaussees inspector Charles-Henri Junod -that seems to play a central role within the conceptual framework of ` urbanisme horloger'. The analysis aims to suggest that there are both difficult challenges and promising intellectual opportunities to be taken by closely observing the ways in which planning histories are publicly disseminated and appropriated by a plurality of social actors.
Economics	We study the manipulability of stable matching mechanisms. To quantify incentives to manipulate stable mechanisms, we consider markets with random cardinal utilities, which induce ordinal preferences over match partners. We show that most agents in large matching markets are close to being indifferent of overall stable matchings. In one-to-one matching, the utility gain by manipulating a stable mechanism does not exceed the gap between utilities from the best and worst stable partners. Thus, most agents in a large market would not have significant incentives to manipulate stable mechanisms. The incentive compatibility extends to many-to-one matching when agents employ truncation strategies and capacity manipulations in a Gale-Shapley mechanism.
Economics	We revisit the role of vertical specialization and supply constraints during the 'great trade collapse' with new data and a new model that allows us to resolve some of the conceptual and data limitations faced by previous studies. We find that (i) demand factors explain a smaller (than previously understood) fraction of the collapse in trade during 2008-9; and (ii) models tend to over-estimate (or under-estimate) the decline in the demand for domestic (or imported) inputs. These model errors are equivalent to an increase of about 4% in the export price premium, on average.
Geography	Political ecology has often defined itself against Eurocentric conceptions of the world. Nevertheless, recent contributions have questioned the ongoing reproduction of an Anglo-American mainstream against 'other political ecologies'. Decentring Anglo-American political ecology has therefore forced a greater recognition of traditions that have developed under the same banner, albeit in different linguistic or national contexts. In addition, thinking more about the situatedness of knowledge claims has forced a deeper questioning of the Eurocentric and colonial production of political ecological research. In this report I begin by reviewing a range of political ecological traditions before going on to look at decolonial moves within the field. I conclude by considering how political ecologists might reframe their practice as one of relational comparison.
Ethics	"Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest growing form of waste worldwide, associated with a range of environmental, health, and justice problems. Unfortunately, disposal and recycling are hindered by a tendency of consumers to resist recycling their e-waste. This backlog of un-discarded e-waste poses significant challenges for the future. This paper addresses the reasons why many people might continue to value their technological artifacts and therefore to hoard them, suggesting that many of these common explanations are deficient in some way. It argues instead for a derivative kind of value, here labelled ""system value"". Addressing the problem of hoarding by invoking the idea of system value, the authors conjecture, could offer some clarity about how to move forward with more successful e-waste management programs."
Management	Are designers doomed to sacrifice creativity when integrating new product development processes? Although many studies highlight the need to produce original and innovative designs, maintaining creativity in the design process continues to be difficult due to industrial constraints. Thus, creativity is restricted to phases in the fuzzy front end' to avoid those constraints that might effectively kill it. However, constraints are also acknowledged as a resource for creativity, as has previously been shown with artists and engineers. Thus, we pose the following research question: In which cases can a constraint be a resource for creativity? To answer this question, we investigate different types of computer-aided design (CAD) software. Relying on an experimental method, we compare the performance of those types of software at the so-called design gap where design sketches are transformed into digital models. We show that some CAD software enables designers to work under additional constraints, be more creative and avoid the trade-off between robustness and creativity, and that understanding this performance means appreciating that such software enables designers to play with the embedded constraints to reveal associated fixations and to design models that follow the constraint but overcome the fixation. Constraints and creativity are linked by two competing processes: constraints decrease the degree of freedom and, as a result, creative possibilities, but embedding constraints increases the awareness of fixations and therefore the capacity to design original models. Today, new CAD tools more effectively support the second process, which leads to acquired originality' in design.
Public Administration	This study comparatively explores the suitability of SERVQUAL and the relationship between perceived service quality, patient satisfaction, and patient preference (intent to revisit the hospital) for the public and private hospitals in Turkey. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicated that SERVQUAL is a valid and reliable instrument to measure health care service quality in Turkey. However, the dimensions of SERVQUAL are not confirmed. Public hospitals' quality is composed of two dimensions (i. reliability-tangibility and ii. responsiveness-assurance-empathy); private hospitals' quality is composed of three dimensions (i. reliability-assurance, ii. tangibility and iii. empathy). Structural equation analysis showed that perceived service quality has a significant positive impact on patient satisfaction and patient satisfaction has a significant positive impact on patient preference both in public and private hospitals. On the other hand, perceived service quality directly affects patient preference in public hospitals while the same effect is indirect thanks to patient satisfaction in private hospitals.
Development Studies	Food insecurity is still remarkably high in the poorest areas of the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Many rural households struggle to have sufficient access to the food they need or prefer. This article explores the extent of food access insecurity and assesses the perceived impact on food security of an Empowerment for Food Security Programme that was launched in the Province in 2007. One of the programme aims was to improve agricultural practices in community gardens, home gardens and broiler production. Data were collected among 390 beneficiary households involved in these agricultural projects in 2010. Findings confirmed that experience-based food insecurity levels were still high, despite the agricultural support programme and the government income transfers. Nevertheless, respondents attribute an improved dietary diversity and better access to resources to the programme.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Respondent-driven sampling is a widely used method for sampling hard-to-reach human populations by link tracing over their social networks. Inference from such data requires specialized techniques because the sampling process is both partially beyond the control of the researcher, and partially implicitly defined. Therefore, it is not generally possible to compute the sampling weights for traditional design-based inference directly, and likelihood inference requires modelling the complex sampling process. As an alternative, we introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator. We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample. We also apply the method and an extension to the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in a high-risk population.
Health Policy & Services	Introduction: There has been a growing emphasis on the use of integrated care plans to deliver cancer care. However little is known about how integrated care plans for cancer patients are developed including featured core activities, facilitators for uptake and indicators for assessing impact. Methods: Given limited consensus around what constitutes an integrated care plan for cancer patients, a scoping review was conducted to explore the components of integrated care plans and contextual factors that influence design and uptake. Results: Five types of integrated care plans based on the stage of cancer care: surgical, systemic, survivorship, palliative and comprehensive (involving a transition between stages) are described in current literature. Breast, esophageal and colorectal cancers were common disease sites. Multi-disciplinary teams, patient needs assessment and transitional planning emerged as key features. Provider buy-in and training alongside informational technology support served as important facilitators for plan uptake. Provider-level measurement was considerably less robust compared to patient and system-level indicators. Conclusions: Similarities in design features, components and facilitators across the various types of integrated care plans indicates opportunities to leverage shared features and enable a management lens that spans the trajectory of a patient's journey rather than a phase-specific silo approach to care.
Communication	"Launched in 2005 as a platform for user-generated content (UGC), YouTube is one of the most popular websites in the world. In this article, I focus on the site's use of ""the view,"" which I argue serves as a pervasive category enacted through the platform, in its information regimes and beyond. The view supports a myth of viewer intentionality and satisfaction and serves as the operational logic of the platform as a whole. It is a category in Durkheim's sense, ordering practices and naturalizing hierarchies and inequalities. These hierarchies concern, and impact on, participation, financial compensation, visibility, and popularity. In making my claims, I demonstrate how the celebratory discourse around YouTube as an empowering tool that levels the media playing field was positively misguided. I make a plea for a critical reading of the view, which can enhance our understanding of the platform and its culture."
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article is about selective abortion. It concentrates on the existential, moral and social conditions that arise when pregnant women, using prenatal diagnosis (PND), are told that there is something seriously wrong with the foetuses that they are carrying. This is characterised as a micro state of emergency, where both normal cognitive categories and normative orders are dissolved. The analyses are anchored in the womens' own presentations and understandings of the processes and dilemmas related to the abortion decisions, and our most important empirical materials are interviews with women who have experienced them. Our main ambition is to show the relation between some important dimensions of the situation in which the abortion decision has to be made, and the special kind of authority on behalf of the women that presents itself. Of equal importance is the vulnerability of the pregnant women, resulting in a co-production of the women as both Sovereigns and Homo Sacer in the decision situation. We also analyse some of the experienced relations between the women and the foetuses, and how the women constitute themselves as moral subjects, with a particular emphasis on the motifs of sacrifice and self-sacrifice. It is a central argument in the article that we have to understand the specificity of the decision situation, without reducing it either to other phases (before or after) of the total processes of PND and selective abortion, or to general discourses of disability or normality. The specificity of the situation in which the abortion decision is made is a pivotal point in society's regulation (in a broad sense) of the field and in the constitution of the regime of selective abortion.
Transportation	Over the past decades, many activity-based travel behaviour models have been proposed based on individuals' independent decision making. The modelling of individuals' joint activity/travel choices, however, has received less attention. In reality, both independent and joint activities/travels form individual's normal daily activity-travel patterns. Travel surveys have indicated that joint activity/travel constitutes an important part in individuals' daily activity-travel patterns. On this basis, explicit modelling of joint activity/travel choices is an essential component for long-term transport planning. In this study, an activity-based network equilibrium model is proposed for scheduling two-individual joint activity-travel patterns (JATPs) in congested multi-modal transit networks. The proposed model can be used to comprehensively investigate individuals' activity choices (e.g. activity start time and duration, activity sequence) and travel choices (e.g. departure time, route and mode) in multi-modal transit networks, including both independent ones and joint ones. The time-dependent JATP choice problem is converted into an equivalent static user equilibrium model by constructing a joint-activity-time-space (JATS) super-network platform. Joint travel benefit is modelled by incorporating a commonality factor in the JATP utility. A solution algorithm without prior JATP enumeration is proposed to solve the JATP scheduling problem on the JATS super-network. Numerical results show that individuals' independent and joint activity/travel choices can be simultaneously investigated by the proposed model. The impacts of joint travel benefit on individuals' independent and joint activity-travel choices are explicitly investigated.
Business, Finance	Modelling mortality and longevity risk is critical to assessing risk for insurers issuing longevity risk products. It has challenged practitioners and academics alike because of first the existence of common stochastic trends and second the unpredictability of an eventual mortality improvement in some age groups. When considering cause-of-death mortality rates, both aforementioned trends are additionally affected by the cause of death. Longevity trends are usually forecasted using a Lee-Carter model with a single stochastic time series for period improvements, or using an age-based parametric model with univariate time series for the parameters. We assess a multivariate time series model for the parameters of the Heligman-Pollard function, through Vector Error Correction Models which include the common stochastic long-run trends. The model is applied to circulatory disease deaths in U.S. over a 50-year period and is shown to be an improvement over both the Lee-Carter model and the stochastic parameter ARIMA Heligman-Pollard model.

Cultural Studies	This paper argues that religious institutions have largely been neglected within the study of cultural policy. This is attributed to the inherently secular tendency of most modern social sciences. Despite the predominance of the 'secularisation paradigm', the paper notes that religion continues to promote powerful attachments and denunciations. Arguments between the 'new atheists', in particular, Richard Dawkins, and their opponents are discussed, as is Habermas' conciliatory encounter with Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). The paper then moves to a consideration of the Roman Catholic Church as an agent of cultural policy, whose overriding aim is the promotion of 'Christian consciousness'. Discussion focuses on the contested meanings of this, with reference to (1) the deliberations of Vatican II, and (2) the exercise of theological and cultural authority by the Pope and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It is argued that these doctrinal disputes intersect with secular notions of social and cultural policy and warrant attention outside the specialist realm of theological discourse.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The principle of mass additivity states that the mass of a composite object is the sum of the masses of its elementary components. Mass additivity is true in Newtonian mechanics but false in special relativity. Physicists have explained why mass additivity is true in Newtonian mechanics by reducing it to Newton's microphysical laws. This reductive explanation does not fit well with deducibility theories of reductive explanation such as the modern Nagelian theory of reduction, and the a priori entailment theory of reduction that is prominent in the philosophy of mind. Nonetheless, I argue that a reconstruction of the explanation that incorporates distinctively philosophical concepts in fact fits both theories. I discuss the implications of this result for both theories and for the reductive explanation of consciousness.
Communication	The paper attempts to build a mathematical model for predicting mobile promotion response behaviour of users towards promotional Short Messaging Services (SMS). The conceptual model has been assumed to predict the response behaviour towards useful to not useful information. The conceptual model has been converted into a mathematical model and empirically tested through fuzzification process. The results show that: 1) the users ignore the promotional SMS irrespective of useful to not useful information; 2) the model shows the cyclical response behaviour of users towards promotional SMS in the short to long run.
Criminology & Penology	Using a theoretical framework based on the concept of sexual proprietariness, findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey are presented. Prevalence of physical and sexual violence, stalking, threats of violence, and power and control were examined for the overall NVAW sample, for those women abused by an intimate partner in particular, and those who were physically abused during a pregnancy. Results indicate that women who are physically abused during pregnancy also experience higher levels of all other forms of abuse compared to women who are not pregnant when abused, including nearly twice the level of power and control.
Management	Much has appeared in the literature about institutional voids, a component of institutional theory. Little has been written, however, about the effects of institutional voids on individuals in emerging market nations and how they might react in proactive ways, including leaving their home country problems to pursue opportunities elsewhere. This article focuses on how institutional voids can create opportunities not only for such individuals but also for the firms that they join and the national economies of their host countries. We illustrate this juxtaposition from problem to opportunity by providing background on institutional voids in Russia as well as the welcoming institutional environments experienced in the United States. We do so by presenting some early findings from a larger ongoing research project. We emphasize not only the individual successes of migrants we interviewed as they seized opportunities afforded by their substantial backgrounds but also the resulting benefits to the U.S. firms that they joined or founded, as well as to the U.S. innovation economy. As illustrations, we offer the profiles of three professionals who came from Russia around 2000. They are part of a much larger group that came from various countries of the former USSR whom we interviewed in the Silicon Valley and Boston-Cambridge innovation hubs.
Rehabilitation	Cultural studies scholars are investigating everyday practices that deny sexual pleasure and create barriers to wellbeing and health. Human rights violations regularly happen at the level of sexuality, which has prompted discussion about formal sexual rights by feminist and disability scholars. People with disabilities often negotiate medical settings that make sexual autonomy challenging. Cultural expectations surrounding sexual pleasure contribute to oppression. Based on the professional values of social work, social workers need to consider the importance of sexual pleasure to wellbeing and advocate against cultural barriers. This analysis will use mixed method by investigating a variety of popular and professional discourses about the cultural expectations surrounding sexual pleasure that create barriers to access. Medical education discourse about approaches to training professionals about sex will be synthesized as potential models for social work education. Autoethnography will be used to support the analysis by highlighting the experience of the author in critical care, graduate education and professional training roles that include integration of sexual pleasure into social work practice. Medical educators have been dealing with reluctance and avoidance of health care professionals to discussions of sexual pleasure for decades. Health care providers, in large numbers, do not feel prepared to integrate sexual pleasure into general care and consumers of health care report insensitivity on the part of professions when pursuing assistance with sexual concerns. This paper will explore ways that social work educators can increase knowledge about sexual pleasure as a complex concept, encourage client-centered attitudes, and build communications skills.
Criminology & Penology	Notions of 'the self' in criminology are rarely explored or defined, which is surprising given how pervasively the term is used. According to narrative criminology, the self is generated and moulded by the stories we tell; our identity emerges through narrative scripts and these stories motivate future action. But this understanding of selfhood is quite narrow. This article attempts to widen it by separating selfhood into three categories: 'the reflexive self' (the person we think we are); 'the unconscious self' (things we do not know that shape us); and 'the experiencing self' (the in-the-moment, living and breathing feeling of being alive). The article begins with a critical engagement with the field of narrative criminology which tends to address 'the reflexive self' somewhat in isolation. Then a number of findings in criminology, psychology and theology are presented which reveal alternative notions of selfhood. This includes engaging with theological accounts that can be described as transcendent or transpersonal. Second, psychoanalytic research notes how our behaviour is often motivated by unconscious processes that are hard to reconcile with traditional notions of selfhood. There is a call to bring these different 'selves' into dialogue and to draw cleaner distinctions between them. Increasing our understanding of selfhood helps us to think more clearly about key criminological debates, such as the causal mechanisms undergirding adaptation and desistance from crime.
Substance Abuse	Large outdoor music festivals have emerged as part of a general expansion of licensed recreational activities, but in research terms they have been largely impenetrable due to commercial sensitivities. These sensitivities notwithstanding, the number and scale of such events necessitate a greater understanding of alcohol and drug use and the potential to promote normative protective behaviours in this context. This study examines self-reported alcohol and drug behaviours of 1589 attendees at a music festival in Scotland during the summer of 2008. Similarities between the outdoor rock music festivals and the dance club scene are considered alongside the challenges associated with risk reduction in these settings. Results show that alcohol was consumed by the majority of samples; however, negative consequences were reported by a minority of respondents, suggesting evidence of controlled hedonism within a situation traditionally associated with unrestrained excess. Similarly, the majority of samples did not use drugs. The majority also report a number of self-regulating protective behaviours suggesting that alcohol and drug use is contained within a developing social culture of 'controlled intoxication'. Results further suggest that although music festivals are transitory events, there is a degree of consistency amongst attendees. Music festivals may therefore be atypical but potentially effective environments to increase protective behaviours using normative messaging and modern communications media. This study was resourced exclusively by local alcohol and drug partnerships.</.
Women'S Studies	This paper explores the construction of the Icelandic mother within the discourse of attachment, on Icelandic websites offering expert advice on pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, and care. The paper examines whether attachment theory discourse in Iceland differs from the more traditional discourse of attachment theory and specifically, if the ideas of attachment and bonding have been modernized or recycled to be more inclusive of fathers and to the promotion of equality and shared parental responsibilities. The paper argues that the maternal body is constructed as a site of production and the maternal mind as (possibly) problematic, unnatural, and pathological. The discourse of attachment present on the Icelandic parenting websites incorporates classic ideas about the primacy of the mother and the intensification of motherhood, and little effort has been made to incorporate fathers into the discourse or to include them as meaningful agents when it comes to attachment and bonding.

Development Studies	In spite of 30 years of international support, the Least Developed Countries (LDC) have become increasingly marginalized. Their recent growth spurt was mainly driven by the pull-effect of the emerging Asian economies. Part of the problem is that the strategies adopted in the past to promote their development mainly emphasized on trade and aid measures, paid little attention to the removal of domestic obstacles, and hardly questioned the global governance system. UNCTAD's 2010 LDC Report addresses many of these problems. It proposes a systemic reforms of the global regimes for trade, FDI, official finance, technology transfers and climate change adaptation; the introduction of new measures addressing the structural weaknesses of the LDCs; and enhanced South-South coorperation with the fast-growing developing countries. By necessity, UNCTAD's Report has been selective in its approach, and has paid less attention to a few topics that are mentioned below for future consideration.
Demography	"Applying latent class analysis to a unique data source of 3,500 Polish migrants in Western Europe, we develop a new typology of Polish migrants under ""free movement"" following the 2004 expansion of the European Union. We characterize these diverse migrant types in terms of their premigration characteristics and link them to varied early social and economic integration outcomes. We show that alongside traditional circular and temporary labor migration, European Union expansion has given rise to new migrant types who are driven by experiential concerns, resulting in a more complex relationship between their economic and social integration in destination countries."
Criminology & Penology	Purpose: History shows that one of the most important institutions to a society is its criminal justice system. The current study offers an analysis of the criminal justice system's effectiveness in identifying, apprehending, convicting, and punishing high-level/persistent offenders. Methods: Data were drawn from all four waves of the Add Health study. Survey-corrected univariate statistics and logistic regression models were estimated to provide population parameter estimates of the frequency of arrest and punishment for a group of persistent offenders compared to non-persistent offenders. Results: Findings indicated persistent offenders (as identified by self-reported crime) were much more likely to be arrested (63% vs. 26%), accounted for more arrests ((x) over bar = 1.71 vs. (x) over bar = .53), were more likely to be convicted (39% vs. 11%), were more likely to be placed on probation (38% vs. 12%), and were more likely to be sent to jail (43% vs. 13%) compared to non-persistent offenders. These differences remained when levels of psychopathy, age, race, and sex were controlled in the logistic regression models. Conclusions: These findings suggest the criminal justice system does a good job of identifying and punishing offenders who break the law more frequently. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Business	Comparative cross-national research is among the oldest approaches of scientific inquiry in the social sciences. We investigate the foundations of published works in cross-national research (CNR) in international business (IB), sociology, and psychology with an eye on leveraging their rich traditions for future IB research. Our approach aims to contribute and address repeated calls for taking an interdisciplinary approach in IB. We examined published CNR in 106 scholarly journals and identified 817 articles with 51,738 citations in IB, 477 works with 30,017 citations in sociology, and 835 articles with 54,519 citations in psychology. We use metric multidimensional scaling to examine the co-citation data for each field and identify knowledge and approaches commonplace in sociology and psychology to propose future research paths in IB. In particular multilevel analysis, which is scarcely used in IB, offers the potential of unfolding new dimensions within the field. Based on the emergent results from our MDS solutions, we recommend multiple future paths for CNR, particularly with respect to IB relationships, market entry, and related domains.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	There are many ways to be an intellectual friend and ally. In this response to Lee Monaghan's article I argue that while groups of scholars and activists may share broad social and political commitments, this does not mean that they should never challenge each others points of view. Sometimes friendship is deepened by a robust interrogation of unexplored areas of difference. In this case, our shared domain is the critical scholarship of body weight. However, one theme in my recent work has explored the mosaic of different writers whom I call 'obesity sceptics' and the radically different ways they arrive at similar conclusions about the 'obesity epidemic'. In this article I offer both context for this work and an account of my interest in the idea of intellectual consistency. In particular, although Monaghan accuses me of abandoning any interest in intellectual rigour, he fails to see that intellectual rigour is precisely what I am most interested in. Above all, my point is that political solidarity and intellectual consistency are rarely easy bedfellows and that emphasising one inevitably threatens the other. This does not mean that solidarity is impossible, but rather that part of the scholar's role is to notice Lazy solidarity where it occurs so that politics and scholarship might enrich, rather than simply pander to, each other.

Law	This article analyses the various methods available to courts in Australia for allocating a loss of trust funds to the beneficiaries of a mixed fund. These distinct methods can be used to allocate a shortfall of trust funds that has occurred due to a fraudulent misappropriation committed by the trustee or as a result of other operational risks. There is still a debate in Australia over the best method for allocating any losses to beneficiaries when there is a shortfall in a mixed fund. Significantly, this article introduces a new practical framework with guidelines for allocating losses in a mixed fund in order to enhance legal certainty for beneficiaries, trustees, insolvency administrators, and courts. It also introduces a new method of distribution that beneficiaries can adopt. The new framework considers the intention (actual or presumed) of the beneficiaries to be the main factor for determining the method of distribution that is applied in allocating a shortfall.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This paper aims to demonstrate how a simple rule of thumb can form a basis to offer a rational and consistent approach to pricing decision-making when faced with (partially) unknown demand and cost functions. To this purpose Nash's decision rule (1975) is re-evaluated, modified, and applied in a service product context. The decision rule can provide management with a powerful indicator of the direction in which profit will change as the result of a change in price. It specifies the conditions under which differential pricing or discounting may be (more) profitable. In this way, the rule provides a basis for a more competitive business pricing policy. The modification to Nash's rule demonstrates that pricing can benefit from quantitative techniques which are comparatively straightforward to understand and apply. It reduces uncertainty by specifying the required elasticity of demand necessary to make change in price worthwhile. With this rule, managers have an additional tool to evaluate potential price changes in the context of particular market circumstances. The paper concludes by explaining how Nash's applied and modified rule provides an original and rational methodology for exploring whether discounting is a suitable pricing strategy for service businesses with high variable costs and inelastic demand patterns.

Development Studies	This article examines the paradox found in mineral-rich Andean countries where the sustained economic growth observed over the last decade has not provoked a corresponding decrease in poverty. The impact of the expansion of the extractive industries (mining and hydrocarbons) on these countries is addressed from the perspective of political economy, indicating that the permanence of poverty, in particular rural poverty in areas where mineral wealth is concentrated, can be explained by inconsistencies between the significant amount of tax revenue that national and regional governments receive from these industries and the ways in which said revenue is used in public policy. Among the factors which explain these inconsistencies are the failure of the State to design and implement social policies and the limitations of a development strategy based on the exploitation of non renewable resources. The argument is illustrated by the cases of Bolivia and Peru.
Communication	Is the use of think tanks ideologically balanced in BBC news and current affairs programming? This study answers this question empirically by establishing which think tanks are referenced in different BBC programming in 2009 and 2015, and then classifying them according to their ideological aims (either left, right, centrist or non-partisan). We draw on a sample size of over 30,000 BBC news and current affairs programmes in 2009 and 2015 to measure how often these think tanks were mentioned or quoted. Overall, BBC news reveals a clear preference for non-partisan or centrist think tanks. However, when the Labour Party was in power in 2009, left and right-leaning think tanks received similar levels of coverage, but in 2015, when the Conservative Party was in government, right-leaning think tanks outnumbered left-leaning think tanks by around two to one. Overall, our findings add weight to a pattern emerging from a number of recent academic studies that show, despite its undoubted commitment to impartiality, BBC news programming has shifted its centre of gravity to the right. We argue that broadcasters need to be more independently aware of how stories emerge, and how issues and sources should be balanced and explained in an increasingly partisan news environment.
Linguistics	Linguistic landscape (LL) research seeks to account for the visible displays of multilingualism on public signage. While surveys of signage in the LL produce quantitative descriptions of language contact in a given area, such analyses shed little light on people's interpretations of multilingual signs. Moreover, even within more qualitative inquiries, after eliciting people's stated understandings of linguistic phenomena, the analyst is faced with interpreting the (participants') interpretations' of the roles and functions of languages on public display. As one means of achieving this in a principled and revealing way, this article discusses the discourse analytic method known as motive analysis, developed by Kenneth Burke. Burke's concern was how and why people impute motives to human action through language use. By focusing on Japanese university students' perceptions of multilingual signage, this study outlines three distinct characterisations of the motivations behind English language use on signage in the Japanese LL. The students' interpretations draw upon discourses of commercialism, cultural essentialism, and globalisation, and accordingly project both materialist and idealist worldviews. The article concludes that motive analysis, used in conjunction with a folk linguistics approach, is a particularly apposite method for providing coherent and defensible analyses of people's interpretations of societal multilingualism.
Geography	Researchers in the spatial analysis literature commonly aggregate crime types: property, violent, and total crime, for example. This practice is done for a number of reasons that range from low crime counts to confidentiality to the form of data provided to researchers. But is this practice appropriate, particularly in the context of studying spatial patterns? In this paper, we analyze the appropriateness of such crime type aggregations. We find that in almost all cases, aggregating crime types is inappropriate for polygon-based analyses. Only in the cases of micro-spatial units of analysis (street segments) may these aggregations be appropriate. Therefore, aggregating crime types in a study that implicitly or explicitly considers the spatial patterns of crime is inappropriate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Women'S Studies	The purpose of this project was to conduct a qualitative study of how participating in in-depth interviews impacted rape survivors. These interviews contained both open-ended, free response section and closed-ended, standardized assessments. The implementation of the interviews was informed by principles of feminist interviewing, which emphasized reducing hierarchy between the interviewer and interviewee, providing information and resources, and creating an emotionally supportive and compassionate setting. Narrative data were analyzed from rape survivors (N = 92) regarding how they were affected by participating in these interviews. Results suggested that the overwhelming majority of survivors found the interview to be a helpful, supportive, and insightful experience. Additional analyses revealed that the feminist interviewing principles were noticed and appreciated by the participants and contributed to their overall positive participation outcomes.
Transportation	Pricing and availability of tickets have always been a source of confusion for customers in transportation industries. What is the best time to buy tickets? Why passengers taking the same flight might pay significantly different prices for the same seat? Why round trip tickets between two cities sometimes become cheaper than the one-way flights between them? Is it fair to buy a ticket for an itinerary cheaper than a ticket for just a part of it? These observations make customers wonder why they pay higher prices for shorter flights. In this paper, we study the airlines' revenue management systems and explain some of these pricing schemes in travel industries. We develop a simulator to study the decision making process of network revenue management and use a numerical study to explore these questions and address some explanations for them. We relate these observations to the revenue management measurements such as the bid price or the adjustment cost and show how the dynamic of the network get influenced by these measures that eventually results in unusual pricing. We explain how a zero or small bid price of a specific leg may cause the price of an itinerary be cheaper than one segment of it and that the small bid price is caused by low demand in comparison to the available capacity. We exhibit network revenue management system and show the above issues for a small network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Education & Educational Research	This article examines differences in the mathematics and English proficiency of academic-track students in Baden-Wurttemberg (N = 3526) and Hamburg (N = 3734), investigating whether and to what extent these differences are reflected in the Abitur grades the students are awarded. The article also examines the extent to which scores in centrally conducted examinations provide better comparability than do coursework grades. Multilevel analyses predicting coursework grades in mathematics revealed clear between-state differences, with students in Hamburg being awarded higher mathematics grades than comparably able students in Baden-Wurttemberg. These differences are partly attributable to frame of reference effects and their impact on teachers' grading practices. No corresponding between-state differences were found for English. Mathematics examination scores provided a much better measure of student achievement than mathematics coursework grades. The findings are discussed in terms of meritocratic access to sought-after university and training places.
International Relations	This article seeks to explore the quantum notion that to 'see' an entanglement is to break it in the context of an 'experiment' regarding the ongoing impact of traumatic political memory on the present. The analysis is a product of collaboration over the past four years between the two authors, one a scholar of international relations, the other a therapeutic practitioner with training in medical physics. Our focus is the conceptual claim that 'seeing' breaks an entanglement rather than the experiment itself. The first section explores a broad contrast between classical and quantum measurement, asking what this might mean at the macroscopic level. The second section categorizes Wendt's claim about language as a form of expressive measurement and explores the relationship to discourse analysis. The third section explores the broad contours of our experiment and the role of a somewhat different form of non-linear expressive measurement. In the final section, we elaborate the relationship between redemptive measurement and breaking an entanglement, which involves a form of 'seeing' that witnesses to unacknowledged past trauma.
Cultural Studies	How does mediated time become human (historically, affectively)? What can the results of an attention to 'new' mediation tell us about duration as embodiment and about becoming human in time? This essay approaches the question of when we become post/human through an exploration of anatomical images that mark the connection between bodies/embodiment and the historical reproduction of knowledge. These transhistorical images offer competing glimpses of the reproduction of bodies in time and the temporality of mediated embodiment. The various modes of mediation that these images embody impose or evade a transtime, a temporality caught up in the production of mediated time as a form of bio-reproduction.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Some sociologists argue that non-intact family structures during childhood have a negative effect on adult children's civic engagement, since they undermine, and in some cases prevent, the processes and activities through which parents shape their children's political attitudes and orientations. In this paper, we evaluate this hypothesis on the basis of longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. In a first step, we construct various measures of family structure during childhood and perform both cross-sectional and sibling difference analyses for various indicators of young adults' civic engagement. Both exercises reveal a significant negative relationship between growing up in a non-intact family and children's political engagement as adults. In a second step, we implement a novel technique-proposed by Oster-for evaluating robustness of results to omitted variable bias. The distinctive feature of this technique is that it accounts for both coefficient movements and movements in R-2-values after the inclusion of controls. Results suggest that our estimates do not suffer from omitted variable bias.
Family Studies	China has seen a rapid urbanization and industrialization, and a dramatic improvement in the quality of life and living conditions since its economic reform started in 1980s. The changes in the social and economic context, and implementation of One Child Family Policy, led to noticeable changes in family structure and relationship. While traditional extended families exist, there occur multiple forms of Chinese families, i.e. nuclear families, single-parent families, DINK families, the single person household and the cohabitant household. Some scholars view the changes as the deterioration of marriage and family values and growing emphasis on individualism. The current paper critically analyzes the major studies of Chinese families to understand the changes in family relationship, structure and values over the past 30 years. Three questions are asked: Has Chinese family become nuclear in structure and diverse in form? Have Chinese shifted their values from collective interests to individual interests? Has Chinese marriage become less important? The extended family is the dominant functional family form in which children and elderly are taken care of while nuclear family is the most common form. Single-person family, single-parent family, remarried family and childless family are a fraction of the population. Families continue to prioritize collective interest over individual interest. Overall Chinese value marriage. The first marriage is postponed. Premarital sex is less stigmatized, but cohabitation remains marginalized. Contemporary family is fluid and dynamic.
Health Policy & Services	Adaptive Reserve (AR) is positively associated with implementing change in ambulatory settings. Deficits in AR may lead to change fatigue or burnout. We studied the association of self-reported AR and burnout among providers to hospitalized medicine patients in an academic medical center. An electronic survey containing a 23-item Adaptive Reserve scale, burnout inventory, and demographic questions was sent to a convenience sample of nurses, house staff team members, and hospitalists. A total of 119 self-administered, online surveys collected from June 2014 to March 2015 were analyzed. Ordinal regression analyses were used to examine the association between AR and burnout. Eighty percent of participants reported either level 1 or 2 burnout. Additionally, 10.9% of participants responded level 0% and 7.6% of participants reported level 3. Participants reporting higher burnout were about three times more likely to report lower AR levels. AR is strongly associated with self-reported burnout by physicians and nurses providing inpatient care at this academic medical center. Growing evidence supports the positive association of AR to successful change implementation in ambulatory settings. Similar studies are needed to determine whether certain levels of AR can predict successful change in hospital settings.
Transportation	Commercial airlines need to balance their environmental footprint with operational cost when managing the assignment of aviation fleets. These assignments are typically made under uncertainty in terms of their cost (change in labor cost, fuel prices, etc.) and impact on the environment (weather, rules and regulations, etc.). Trade-offs of this kind are complicated, and often result in sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, by considering random demand, fare price and avgas price, we propose a multi-criteria method to solve fleet assignment problems. It involves the use of an objective, such as minimizing emission cost or maximizing profit, as a target or a level of aspiration, and the construction of a solution that deviates least from the given target in the L2-norm. We discuss the theoretical advantage of this approach and assess its performance using benchmark data on two test cases-Jetstar Asia, and a major Chinese airline. The Jetstar Asia case is first used to test the effectiveness of this approach in balancing profit against emission by employing an integrated form of simulated and open-source acquisition data. For the case of the Chinese airline, we develop a simple rounding algorithm to deal with the large-scale problem. All cases exhibited the superiority of our compromise approach over the linear-weighted-sum method in terms of accessing the utopia point in discrete objective space. An out-of-sample test revealed the vicinity of the compromise solutions to the Pareto solutions. Our method also yielded better assignment than the airline's existing strategy in terms of both profit and emissions reduction. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Political Science	Do party strongholds exacerbate partisan extremism? Using over 140 years of election data and roll call votes I find that, on average, members of Congress elected in states where their party overwhelmingly dominates tend to moderate from their national party's ideology when compared to members elected in more competitive settings. I argue that heavily one-party states have often been engendered by widespread agreement over locally salient issues, group affect, or imbalanced party organization, not because the electorate consistently agrees with one national party. Consequently, representatives have incentive to run under the dominant party label but must respond to diverse electoral pressures that align to both national parties. While scholars prominently observe one-partyism in the Democratic South, I observe that the plains and rural west, particularly between 1896 and 1932, can be characterized as one-party Republican, too. Perhaps surprisingly, state party strength since the 1990s, in a historical perspective, is quite balanced.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Multi-site evaluations, particularly of federally funded service programs, pose a special set of challenges for program evaluation. Not only are there contextual differences related to project location, there are often relatively few programmatic requirements, which results in variations in program models, target populations and services. The Jail Diversion and Trauma Recovery-Priority to Veterans (JDTR) National Cross-Site Evaluation was tasked with conducting a multi-site evaluation of thirteen grantee programs that varied along multiple domains. This article describes the use of a mixed methods evaluation design to understand the jail diversion programs and client outcomes for veterans with trauma, mental health and/or substance use problems. We discuss the challenges encountered in evaluating diverse programs, the benefits of the evaluation in the face of these challenges, and offer lessons learned for other evaluators undertaking this type of evaluation.

Public Administration	"The measurement and comparison of the public administration output of universities is an important means for mapping the state of the field. However, such exercises are very sensitive to design choices made in the ranking and measurement methodology. Following an overview of existing research on journal reputation and quality in public administration and studies of institutional reputation and productivity, this article presents five alternative rankings of journal article output in public administration to illustrate how rankings of universities in the field of public administration vary depending on what is considered to be a ""good journal."" Article output extracted from Web of Science and Scopus for the period 2009-2013 is used. It was found that using SSCI Journal Citation Reports as opposed to journal reputation has a considerable effect on the regional composition of the rankings. The article discusses key challenges in measuring and ranking article output in the discipline of public administration."
Public Administration	Based on data drawn from the Office of Personnel Management's Federal Human Capital Survey, as well as from data provided in written interviews, this study offers empirical evidence that followership mediates the relationship that exists between participative leadership and public organization performance.
History Of Social Sciences	Eleanor Gibson and Richard Walk's famous visual cliff experiment is one of psychology's classic studies, included in most introductory textbooks. Yet the famous version which centers on babies is actually a simplification, the result of disciplinary myth-making. In fact the visual cliff's first subjects were rats, and a wide range of animals were tested on the cliff, including chicks, turtles, lambs, kid goats, pigs, kittens, dogs, and monkeys. The visual cliff experiment was more accurately a series of experiments, employing varying methods and a changing apparatus, modified to test different species. This paper focuses on the initial, nonhuman subjects of the visual cliff, resituating the study in its original experimental logic, connecting it to the history of comparative psychology, Gibson's interest in comparative psychology, as well as gender-based discrimination. Recovering the visual cliff's forgotten menagerie helps to counter the romanticization of experimentation by focusing on the role of extrascientific factors, chance, complexity, and uncertainty in the experimental process.
Political Science	The question of the role of Islam in the public space has become a new pivotal point in political disputes about civil liberties in Western Europe. This debate challenges the scholarly literature on tolerance by highlighting that our understanding of the situational factors shaping tolerance judgments remains limited. This study therefore investigates how the salience of the signaling of religious group membership influences religious tolerance. Based on a unique question-wording experiment embedded in an approximately nationally representative survey, I demonstrate that conspicuous manifestations of religious outgroup membership spark stronger intolerance than subtle manifestations and that anxiety mediates the effect of conspicuous manifestations of religious outgroup membership. Finally, I demonstrate that the effect of the salience of religious outgroup membership is strongest among those who are highly opposed to secularism. I conclude by discussing how these findings constitute an important extension of the extant work on tolerance and feed back into the discussion regarding the role of religion in the public space.
Family Studies	Grounded in a cultural-ecological perspective, the goals of this study were to examine the implications of young adolescents' experiences of racial discrimination for the quality of relationships with mothers and fathers and to test whether sociocultural processes, such as youth ethnic identity and parents' racial socialization strategies, moderated these linkages. Participants were older and younger adolescents in 176 two-parent African American families who completed questionnaires about their discrimination experiences, ethnic identities, and warmth and conflict in their relationships with parents. Mothers and fathers reported on cultural socialization and preparation for bias practices. Consistent with an emotional spillover hypothesis, discrimination was linked to poorer relationship quality with both mothers and fathers. Youth ethnic identity and mothers' racial socialization moderated discrimination-relationship linkages. Findings were consistent with prior research on discrimination and highlight the protective nature of some sociocultural processes for family relationships.
Area Studies	The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is well known and understood within the intricacies and intractability that it possesses. The political geography of the region known as the Holy Land has been debated by elites since before the establishment of the state of Israel. Demographic realities have altered the geopolitical definitions of what is defined as Israel and Palestine. Currently, there is a fresh push by political elites to achieve new political resolutions that will respect the aspirations of both the Israelis and Palestinians. This process has been bogged down by new demographic realities specifically in the West Bank. An alternative mode of negotiations known as the 'Minds of Peace' experiment or MOPE uses a grassroots approach to try the overcome stumbling blocks in the current Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The MOPE experiment provided fresh and valuable perspectives on the conflict. This article discusses reflections of the author on this new and innovative approach to peacemaking.
Development Studies	BRAC started out as a limited relief operation in 1972 in a remote region in Bangladesh and has become probably the largest nongovernmental development organisation in the world. Organising the poor using communities' own human and material resources, BRAC has developed a holistic development approach geared towards inclusion, using tools like microfinance, education, healthcare, legal services, community empowerment, social enterprises and BRAC University. Its work now touches the lives of an estimated 135 million people in 12 countries in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. BRAC established a Research and Evaluation Division (RED) in 1975 that, over time, has grown and developed as a multidisciplinary independent research unit. The division has been playing an important role in designing BRAC's development interventions, monitoring progress, documenting achievements and undertaking impact assessment studies. It provides an analytical basis for BRAC's programmatic decisions, fine-tuning it for better performance and making development efforts evidence-based, effective and community-sensitive. This article uses specific examples to demonstrate how a close link between evaluation and research, and project planning and implementation can drive a dynamic process of 'development', both in the sense of economic and social development of communities and in the sense of institutional change and innovation within BRAC itself. For example, research on the distribution of benefits in microfinance demonstrated that it rarely reached the 'ultra-poor', that is, those spending >80 per cent of income on food and still not reaching 80 per cent of calorie requirements. The ultra-poor tend to have limited social assets; this is a reason why they may not be included as members of self-selected microfinance groups, and there is a considerable literature on this. In 2002, this led directly to the introduction of a package of specific measures, centred on 'asset-transfer', which has enabled hundreds of thousands to 'graduate' from ultra-poverty and has been replicated in at least 11 countries. Results have been verified extensively through rigorous evaluation and are contributing to a continuing global policy dialogue on the effectiveness of different approaches to 'social safety nets'. This article also explores how organisational structures in BRAC aid or impede the reporting on results and the documentation of effects. It also examines the relationship between programme Management Information System and rigorous evaluation and the institutional factors encouraging or retarding BRAC's focus on results measurement and the development of a positive institutional culture. Specifically, BRAC RED focuses on the method that is best suited for each context and frequently conducts research using mixed methodology, with a good blend of qualitative and quantitative research. This has been understood from the beginning, but has also been borne out by experience throughout BRAC's development.
Linguistics	In Japanese loanword phonology, geminates optionally devoice when there is another voiced obstruent within the same stem, i.e., geminates may optionally devoice when they violate OCP(voice). This devoicing of OCP-violating geminates has received much attention in the recent phonological literature. However, the debates centering around this phenomenon have relied primarily on intuition-based data, and no systematic judgment experiments have been performed. This paper fills that gap. The experiment reported in this paper shows that Japanese speakers do find devoicing of geminates natural when there is another voiced stop within the same word, i.e., when the geminates violate OCP(voice). The experiment moreover finds other interesting aspects of devoicing: (i) the naturalness of devoicing of OCP-violating geminates correlates positively with the lexical frequencies of the words in question, (ii) the naturalness of devoicing of OCP-violating geminates is not significantly affected by place of articulation, (iii) speakers find (context-free) devoicing of geminates more natural than devoicing of OCP-violating singletons, and (iv) speakers find the devoicing of OCP-violating singletons more natural in word-medial position than in word-initial position.
Business, Finance	This article examines the implementation of Best Value-an audit tool of the U.K. government's modernization policy-in local government, specifically in Scotland. This is a study of the impact of this key concept, primarily on the management of these public services. The aim of Best Value Audit is to enhance transparency and accountability of management actions in local government. The article draws on Power's (1997) Audit Society thesis to inform this research. The Best Value approach has been heavily influenced by audit processes and oversight bodies both in its design and implementation. This article supports the Power thesis of the Audit Society: It reveals the manner in which audit practices are deployed by agencies of central government with the intent to shape the management of local government.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The academic literature on obesity frequently bifurcates into two poles: a realist pole that treats obesity as a biomedical fact, a health risk and an 'epidemic', and a second, constructionist pole that adopts a critical view of obesity as a moral panic driven by political interests and cultural values. Drawing on a wide range of literature from epidemiology, medical sociology, public health, political economy, cultural studies and popular journalism, this article maps out a realist-constructionist divide within academia and the public sphere, and examines the insights and limitations of these perspectives. After mapping the main 'silos' within obesity studies, we examine two key questions: (1) is the obesity epidemic based on medical fact or political interest, and (2) is obesity a disease or a social identity. Drawing from the metatheoretical principles of critical realism, we argue that obesity scholarship can be advanced by conceptualizing the obesity epidemic as a 'hybrid' construction that arises out of the interaction of biophysical, socio-economic and cultural forces. This analysis demonstrates the useful role of social theory integrating diverse analytic perspectives, and bringing clarity to a heated public debate that characteristically points the finger of blame at obese individuals.

Communication	Young children today are early adopters and frequent users of touchscreen devices. This study explores how parents perceive the role of new media in their families, how and why they regulate children's media use, and how they feel about this process. The study conducts ethnographic interviews with 20 South Korean parents of two-to six-year-olds and observes 10 children in their media use and interaction with parents. We find that parents presumed that touchscreen media wielded a more negative than positive influence on their children. As a result, parents engaged in restrictive and technical mediation, though they often failed to effectively manage their children's media use due to practical challenges. The failure of parental mediation made the parents feel guilty. We suggest a greater need to attend to the contexts and emotions in which parental mediation of children's media use occurs.
Rehabilitation	This study investigated the ability of persons with aphasia to complete a series of experimental tasks involving single symbol and subject-verb-object sentence identification on a speech-generating device (SGD) in the presence/absence of competing stimuli. In all, 10 persons with Broca's aphasia and 10 persons in the control group were compared on accuracy and response latency of symbol identification across three listening conditions. Persons with aphasia identified fewer symbols accurately and had longer response latencies than persons in the control group. Number of symbols on the screen and location level had a significant effect on accuracy and latency for both groups. Persons with aphasia perceived tasks to be more difficult than persons in the control group. Results indicate that effective use of SGDs by persons with aphasia may depend on several message organization factors including location and number of symbols per screen.
Health Policy & Services	In response to Manthous, we discuss the role of unions in health care. The ethical quandary that Manthous perceives in health care worker unions is overstated because patient and worker interests are frequently aligned. The search for a selfless union overlooks the importance of adequate compensation for providing excellent care. The collective actions employed by health care workers' unions need not include strikes or slowdowns and can be consistent with patient safety and well-being.
Communication	This study examined how sponsorship disclosure on television influences persuasion knowledge and brand responses (i.e., brand memory and brand attitude). Moreover, we tested whether extending disclosure duration increases its effect. By conducting an experiment (N?=?116) we compared the effects of no disclosure to a 3-second and a 6-second disclosure. Results showed that especially a 6-second disclosure activates conceptual and consequently attitudinal persuasion knowledge. Regarding brand responses, we found that disclosure directly increased brand memory, regardless of duration. In addition, a 6-second disclosure indirectly resulted in less favorable brand attitudes through higher rates of attitudinal persuasion knowledge. Theoretically, this study provides insights into how sponsorship disclosure influences the persuasion process and the role of persuasion knowledge within this process.
Anthropology	A scapula malformation is described in two burials from the site of the late medieval Dominican friary at Ipswich, UK. The changes appear most consistent with primary scapular neck dysplasia. One of the burials also showed clear signs of leprosy. The burials are of lay benefactors of the friary. The Ipswich Dominican friary had no known function as a leprosy hospital. Finding of burials of lepers other than in burial grounds of leprosaria is highly unusual for medieval England. Scapular neck dysplasia has a strong genetic component in its aetiology. TNs, coupled with its rarity, suggests a close genetic link between the two burials. The findings suggest that in this case, family ties with the friary overrode the normal medieval custom of interring lepers in leprosy hospitals. This illustrates that even rare skeletal variants may convey useful biocultural information about past populations, Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	To investigate differences and similarities in birth outcomes, postpartum health and primary care contacts of mothers born overseas of non-English speaking background (NESB) compared with Australian-born mothers. Nulliparous women were recruited in early pregnancy (a parts per thousand currency sign24 weeks gestation) to a prospective pregnancy cohort study from six metropolitan public hospitals in Victoria, Australia. Analyses are based on questionnaires completed in pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. Of the 1,507 women recruited in the study, 1,431 women (95%) were followed up at 3 months postpartum. Immigrant mothers of NESB (n = 212) and Australian born mothers (n = 1,074) had similar obstetric outcomes and postpartum physical health outcomes. Immigrant women were more likely to say they had been depressed for 2 weeks or longer since the birth (Adj OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.3-2.8); to report relationship problems (Adj OR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.9-2.1) and to report lower emotional satisfaction with their relationship with the partner (Adj OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.1-2.6) after adjusting for age, education status, income, method of birth and genital tract trauma. Immigrant mothers were less likely to be asked about feeling low or depressed by general practitioners (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and about relationship problems by maternal and child health nurses (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Immigrant women of NESB reported greater psychological distress, less emotional satisfaction with their partner and more relationship problems in the first 3 months postpartum than Australian born women. Although immigrant mothers had an equivalent level of contact with primary care practitioners in the first 3 months postpartum, they were less likely to be asked about their emotional well-being or about relationship problems by health professionals.
Family Studies	The predominant view in both the research literature and practice is that marital quality declines over time. Although the majority of research using variable-centered approaches such as latent growth curve modeling supports this view, contemporary research using person-centered group-based trajectory modeling techniques suggest a variety of trajectories of marital quality development, including stability, decline, and, occasionally, rebound following decline. The present review synthesizes this current body of research and summarizes the variety of trajectories found across 14 reports examining both positive and negative marital quality dimensions. The theories informing this body of research and the predictors of the various trajectories are also reviewed. We conclude with a discussion of methodological and practical implications of the findings to date and introduce the honeymoon-as-ceiling effect, a phrase we use to capture the consistent finding that marital quality rarely increases beyond its initial value.
Education, Special	Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in secondary school settings (i.e., grades 6-12) typically struggle with multiple academic challenges. Critics have noted that secondary schools traditionally have not been particularly effective in helping students with ASD develop self-determination (e.g., self-management) skills, which are considered pre-requisites to success in academics. Thus, there is a significant need for increased parent-professional collaboration in secondary schools. This study examined the effectiveness of coaching parents to implement a technology-mediated (e.g., iPad) approach to increasing the homework-related self-management skills for mathematics of five middle school students with ASD. Results indicate that these five students significantly increased their math homework self-management skills as a consequence of effectively using iPad applications when coached by their parents.
Business	This study focuses on how life satisfaction mediates the links from dispositional optimism to entrepreneurial success and exit intentions. The theoretical basis of this study is a hierarchical approach to personality, and its primary contribution is to the research on psychological entrepreneurship. To analyze potential links among these constructs we develop five hypotheses and then test them on small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. Hypotheses are tested by using consistent bootstrapped PLS-SEM estimations. Our results indicate that dis-positional optimism is associated with entrepreneurial success. Our study also reveals that life satisfaction mediates the relationship between dispositional optimism and entrepreneurial success in addition to the relationship between dispositional optimism and exit intentions. Our study demonstrates that entrepreneurial success is related to exit intentions. We conclude by discussing the implications for researchers and practitioners.
Environmental Studies	We study whether the contemporaneous and lagged volatility of the commodity/energy markets can help predict the volatility of Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) sovereign risk in the quantiles. We first define the latent volatility using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) specifications and then use it within a quantile-based regression augmented with a dichotomous variable identifying the periods before and after the mid-2014 energy price decline. The analysis on daily data from January 4, 2010 to August 31, 2016 provides evidence that the volatility relation between commodity/energy and sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets is not the same under different volatility conditions, although energy volatility is slightly more important than commodity volatility. Importantly, the volatility of commodity/energy markets shapes sovereign risk in middle and upper volatility quantiles of commodities/energy exporters (Brazil and Russia). While in commodities/energy importers, such as China, predictability is only significant in upper volatility quantiles. Notably, we reveal the importance of the mid-2014 energy price decline for the volatility dynamics of BRIC sovereign risk; after the mid-2014, the volatility of the sovereign risk has increased in Brazil and Russia, while it has decreased in India. Finally, we recommend adoption of measures to reduce commodity and energy dependency.
Political Science	The lastest empirical onslaught on democracy comes from globalization. Democracy encompasses Constitutional power, popular sovereignty, the values of political pluralism, the openness and transparency of the constitutional norms, and the democratic principle of the fundamental right to political participation. The paper seeks to explain the intensity of the damage done to democracy term the five different phases of the first stage of globalization and in its second stage. At the same time, the paper looks for solutions in order to overcome the problem to try to diminish the attack on democracy.
Ethnic Studies	The last 20 years have seen a flood of studies of resistance, ranging from collective to individual acts of resistance, from the study of material aspects to its more ideational ones. Yet students of resistance have neglected the psychological dimension of everyday individual acts of resistance to power. This article is a first step to remedy that oversight. Inspired by Butler's reading of Foucault's notion of power at work in subjection and resistance, the article uses Goffman to substantiate such an account. Based on a 20-month ethnographic study of a traditional immigrant suburb north of Stockholm, Sweden, which is being redeveloped into a high-tech region, it offers empirical insight into the psychic life of resistance. Further, a particular resistance strategy is identified: symbolic dislocations through adherence to a boundary other than the one subjecting the self in the first place.
Gerontology	Studies of disclosure amongst older people living with HIV (PLWH) are uninformed by critical social gerontological approaches that can help us to appreciate how older PLWH see and treat age as relevant to disclosure of their HIV status. These approaches include an ethnomethodologically-informed social constructionism that explores how 'the' life course (a cultural framework depicting individuals' movement through predictable developmental stages from birth to death) is used as an interpretive resource for determining self and others' characteristics, capacities, and social circumstances: a process Rosenfeld and Gallagher (2002) termed 'lifecoursing'. Applying this approach to our analysis of 74 life-history interviews and three focus groups with older (aged 50+) people living with HIV in the United Kingdom, we uncover the central role that lifecoursing plays in participants' decision-making surrounding disclosure of their HIV to their children and/or older parents. Analysis of participants' accounts uncovered four criteria for disclosure: the relevance of their HIV to the other, the other's knowledge about HIV, the likelihood of the disclosure causing the other emotional distress, and the other's ability to keep the disclosed confidential. To determine if these criteria were met in relation to specific children and/or elders, participants engaged in lifecoursing, evaluating the other's knowledge of HIV, and capacity to appropriately manage the disclosure, by reference to their age. The use of assumptions about age and life-course location in decision-making regarding disclosure of HIV reflects a more nuanced engagement with age in the disclosure decision-making process than has been captured by previous research into HIV disclosure, including on the part of people aging with HIV.

Criminology & Penology	"Criminologists have long studied the relationship between economic conditions and crime. Empirical evidence is inconclusive, pointing at different directions. This may reflect the conflicting theoretical predictions on the relationship between these phenomena, but also the prevailing methodological choice which focuses on linear relationships even though nonlinearities are plausible theoretically. In this paper, we revisit the empirical relationship between economic conditions and crime by exploring potential nonlinearities. We look at flexible parametric specifications that include up to a cubic term of per capita income (or one dummy for each income quintile) and nonparametric and semi-parametric specifications (such as General Additive Models). Our results are robust to controlling for the standard socioeconomic, demographic, and policy determinants of crime, as well as to including a lagged dependent variable or state and time fixed effects. We document the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between crime and income within US states for the period 1970-2011. Crime increases with per capita income until it reaches a maximum, and then decreases as income keeps rising. This ""Crime Kuznets Curve"" (CKC) exists for property crime and for categories of violent crime that can be related to economic appropriation, like robbery, and is less robust for violent crimes not connected to economic incentives. We show that this pattern cannot be explained by correlated changes in economic inequality or by changes in law enforcement. In addition to providing robust evidence of the existence of a CKC, our findings lay the groundwork for studies exploring the underlying theoretical mechanisms. These should go beyond income inequality or law enforcement, and should explain why the results hold more clearly for property than for violent crime. Our findings and subsequent research to understand the underlying drivers are relevant for policy, as they suggest that violent conflict cannot be tackled solely by the trickle-down forces of economic growth."
International Relations	This article develops and applies the role of 'common sense' in a Gramscian theory of transnational counter-hegemony. Building on recent interpretative literature on the alter-globalisation movement, it applies this framework to then evaluate empirically the impact of the alter-globalisation movement on the realm of global 'common sense' understandings of the world in the period 2002 to 2007. It shows that there is little empirical support for the notion that the alter-globalisation movement effected a legitimation crisis for neo-liberalism as a hegemonic project on a global scale. Instead, a more ambivalent and potentially reactionary situation amongst collectively held norms is revealed. This indicates the shortcomings of the alter-globalisation movement as a coalition of social forces capable of mounting an ideological attack on neo-liberalism and forging a new intellectual-moral bloc.
Economics	We consider the impact of a regulatory process forcing an incumbent telecom operator to make its local broadband network available to other companies (local loop unbundling, or LLU). Entrants are then able to upgrade their individual lines and offer Internet services directly to customers. Employing a very detailed data set covering the whole of the United Kingdom, we find that, over the course of time, many entrants have begun to take advantage of unbundling. LLU entry only had a positive effect on broadband penetration in the early years, and no longer in the recent years as the market reached maturity. In contrast, LLU entry continues to have a positive impact on the quality of the service provided, as entrants differentiate their products upwards compared to the incumbent. We also assess the impact of competition from an alternative form of technology (cable) which is not subject to regulation, and what we discover is that inter-platform competition has a positive impact on both penetration and quality.
Business, Finance	We evaluate the conditional performance of U.K. equity unit trusts using the approach of Lynch and Wachter (2007, 2008) relative to three conditional linear factor models. We find significant time variation in the conditional performance of some trust portfolios and individual trusts using the lag term spread as the information variable. The conditional performance of the trusts is countercyclical and larger trusts have more countercyclical performance than smaller trusts within certain investment sectors. These patterns in conditional trust performance cannot be fully explained by the underlying securities that the trusts hold.
Communication	The public health community generally agrees that TV exposure influences children's cognitions and behaviors. Research on TV's influence on children's eating habits has mainly analyzed advertisements aired during TV programs for children and how they influence children's food preferences and practices. Yet little is known about the food messages children encounter in the content of their favorite programs. Most previous studies may have underestimated children's total exposure by failing to take food exposures within programming into account. The current study addresses this by examining the amount and characteristics of food content appearing in commercials and the content of shows seen by children in Peru. Using a sample of children's TV programs and the ads run during the programs' commercial breaks, it was found that overall, 17% of all commercials in the sample were for food and beverages, and 28% of all the program content included food items such as water, fruit, snacks, or prepared meals. Overall, children in Peru seem to be exposed to TV messages about food and beverages that mostly should be consumed only sparingly.
Education & Educational Research	The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of blended e-learning on electrical machinery performance (achievement test and self-assessment). Participants were two classes of 11th graders majoring in electrical engineering and taking the electrical machinery class at a vocational high school in Taiwan. The participants were randomly selected and assigned to either the experimental group (n = 33) which studied through blended e-learning or the control group (n = 32) which studied through traditional classroom learning. The experiment lasted for five weeks. The results showed that (a) there were no significant differences in achievement test scores between blended e-learning and traditional learning; (b) students in the experimental group obtained significantly higher scores on self-assessment than students in the control group; (c) students' scores on self-assessment were significantly higher after studying through blended e-learning than before. Overall, blended e-learning did not significantly affect students' achievement test scores, but significantly affected their self-assessment scores.
Education & Educational Research	Background: Since the passage of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the demographic landscape of American schools has changed dramatically. By 2011, there were 12.4 million Latinos enrolled in prekindergarten to 12th-grade public schools, which constitutes 23.9% of the U.S. student population. A primary challenge that faces schools today is the increasing segregation of these Latinos, who are now the most segregated group of students in the West. Despite the Supreme Court decision to address the plight of segregation of Latino students, desegregation and language programming to assist English learners has been viewed as contradictory and competing with each other. Implications: The authors contend that school and community leaders should focus on the promotion of dual immersion, International Baccalaureate, and magnet programs to provide Latino, and particularly, English learners, the opportunity to attend strong integrated schools.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"During the past thirty years, immunological metaphors, motifs, and models have come to shape much social theory and philosophy. Immunology, so it seems, often has served to naturalize claims about self, identity, and sovereignty-perhaps most prominently in Jacques Derrida's later studies. Yet the immunological science that functions as ""nature"" in these social and philosophical arguments is derived from interwar and Cold War social theory and philosophy. Theoretical immunologists and social theorists knowingly participated in a common culture. Thus the ""naturalistic fallacy"" in this case might be reframed as an error of categorization: its conditions of possibility would require ceaseless effort to purify and separate out the categories of nature and culture. The problem-inasmuch as there is a problem-therefore is not so much the making of an appeal to nature as assuming privileged access to an independent, sovereign category called ""nature."""
Geography	This commentary first documents the ways in which President Jair Bolsonaro's administration has evoked securitized discursive strategies that frame Brazil's national response to COVID-19 as a matter of defense instead of public health. We then ask: What does it mean to talk about the virus and the ways to address it through war-framings? We argue that the Bolsonaro administration has framed the COVID-19 pandemic as an extra-territorial threat in an effort to create internal stability while failing to handle the matter effectively. Such politically motivated spatial framings inhibit an effective response in Brazil and pose a severe threat to public health. Once COVID-19 becomes securitized, the response is framed by the military bureaucracy rather than public health authorities, resulting in dangerous consequences.
Criminology & Penology	Whether it insists on the significance of anticipation or interrogates the centrality of pre-crime to security practice, current scholarship misses how security professionals make sense of their work's temporality. Borrowing its theoretical tools from the sociology of generations and evaluation, this article focuses on how Canadian border officers rely on generational categorizations to negotiate change in their work. It proposes exploring the coexistence of competing temporalities in border control through the notion of generational borderwork. Produced by different paths of professional socialization and embedded in tensions over social status in ports of entry, generational borderwork makes more explicit the security field's logic of aging, the internal dissensions over policing methods and the decisions these differences sustain. Whether it concerns nostalgia for economic protectionism or disagreements over the respective value of intelligence, technologies and interview skills, the contested nature of time in border control invites investigation into officers' transforming policing sensibilities.
Economics	The model predicts out-of-sample whether an NBER-defined peak or trough will occur within the next half-year. It yields a 100% proportion of correct recursive forecasts from 1970 to 2015. All the necessary data are readily available in un-revised form. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Education, Special	Teacher educators are expected to provide preservice special education teachers with extensive knowledge about a variety of topics as well as allowing candidates a chance to engage in higher-level thinking about content. Today, some teacher educators are thinking outside the box when it comes to instructional delivery by moving beyond the traditional lecture format for instruction. This article discusses three alternatives to lecture-style instruction: (a) interteaching, (b) video-based reflection, and (c) content acquisition podcasts. Each of these strategies is a way to improve candidates' engagement with the material while improving learning. The features and benefits of each approach are provided in addition to steps for using these strategies within teacher preparation.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Informed by Lacan's reading of the Sophocles' tragedy Antigone, this paper will explore the political limits of an ethical act determined by perseverance in desire. The tragedy of Antigone can be considered to be an ethical and political act insofar that suspension of the symbolic coordinates that support the organization of law and community is produced, thereby allowing the restructuring of political space. The morbidity of desire, i.e. its inseparable relationship to death, mobilizes a paradoxical productivity that, without actually filling the immanent void of the symbolic field, allowing a continuous creation ex nihilo in which a society can discuss its organization of relations and political significations.
Business	"This study aims to identify consumers"" motives for visiting the Facebook page of a food retail chain. Data were collected using an online survey of 1208 members of the FB page of a Canadian food retail chain. The results show that respondents"" main motives are to obtain information on discounted items, consult recommended recipes, enter contests, and learn about new products available in-store. Analyses identify informative, dynamism, and enjoyment values as the most important motives that influence attitudes toward the food retail chain""s FB page. A further qualitative analysis of the FB pages of four supermarket chains supports these results."
History Of Social Sciences	The cantonment has been a neglected topic of planning history, yet is significant for urban landscapes and governance in both India and Africa. Drawing upon scholarship in critical comparative legal geography, path dependency and Foucault's genealogical method, the article explores the transfer of laws and regulations for urban governance by networks of knowledge and actors, tracing a line of descent from rules for cantonments in British India, through Lugard's Nigerian period, and his indirect rule policy to townships and local government ordinances. The influence of Lugard's Political Memoranda and Dual Mandate books is evidenced through the work of various senior officials moving between colonies, specifically South Africa, Kenya, and Northern Rhodesia.
Ethics	"INFORMED CONSENT IS A BASIC requirement for the conduct of ethical research involving human subjects. Currently, the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association and the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) are widely accepted as international codes regulating human subject research and the informed consent sections of these documents are quite important. Debates on the applicability of these guidelines in different socio-cultural settings are ongoing and many workers have advocated the need for national or regional guidelines. Nigeria, a developing country, has recently adopted its national guideline regulating human subject research: the National Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC) code. A content analysis of the three guidelines was done to see if the Nigerian guidelines confer any additional protection for research subjects. The concept of a Community Advisory Committee in the Nigerian guideline is a novel one that emphasizes research as a community burden and should promote a form of ""research friendship"" to foster the welfare of research participants. There is also the need for a regular update of the NHREC code so as to address some issues that were not considered in its current version."
Gerontology	Americans remain at risk for potentially devastating costs for LTSS that are not covered by Medicare or private health insurance. This article proposes a legislative package to finance LTSS, offering LTSS coverage in the context of existing integrated health plans. Building on current federal demonstrations, LTSS coverage would initially be integrated with Medicare Advantage plans. The goal is to provide coverage for LTSS at little or no incremental cost within the existing health insurance system, relying on well-managed home- and community-based care to reduce the use of expensive hospital and institutional care.
Business	"Targeting the ""right"" consumers is a core part of marketing. Whereas existing techniques to identify these consumers use demographic or psychographic variables or behaviors such as response probabilities, a proposed new targeting approach builds on consumers' incremental responses to identify them by their willingness-to-pay (WTP) ranges. These WTP ranges reveal a consumer as a definite buyer, a definite non-buyer, or an indecisive buyer. The proposed theoretical framework indicates that indecisive buyers offer the highest incremental responses to targeted marketing mix activities and thus should be the most preferred targeting group. A sequence of three laboratory experimental studies validates the proposed approach for targeted price discounts and non-price tactics. In addition, a large-scale field experiment involving a consumer engagement campaign that includes observed purchase behavior demonstrates the high external validity and applicability of this approach.

Geography	The question of how ecosystem services can be spatially defined and visualized continues to be challenging, particularly for cultural services such as recreation and ecotourism. This study proposes a methodological framework that combines Geographic Information System and participatory methods (Delphi method and Analytic Hierarchy Process) to map recreation and ecotourism at the municipality level. Attributes selected were singular natural resources, scenic beauty, accessibility, tourism attraction capacity, and tourism use aptitude, which were represented by specific spatial criteria validated and weighted by experts. Two types of indicators were obtained and mapped: i) Recreation and ecotourism potential (REPf) which, based on the selected attributes, measured recreation potential in a 0-100 point scale; and ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities (REOi), which adjusting REPf by carrying capacity, measured the visitors per hectare that could sustainably recreate in the study area. The resulting maps were highly consistent with the distribution of areas recognized by the tourism authorities as of interest for recreation development (i.e. areas with emblematic flora and fauna and the presence of public and private protected areas). Overall, the methodology demonstrates an important potential for identifying recreation areas to inform local decision making regarding land use planning. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Diagnosis in psychiatry is portrayed as the same type of activity as diagnosis in other areas of medicine. However, the notion that psychiatric conditions are equivalent to physical diseases has been contested for several decades. In this paper, I use the work of Jeff Coulter and David Ingelby to explore the role of diagnosis in routine psychiatric practice. Coulter examined the process of identification of mental disturbance and suggested that it was quite different from the process of identifying a physical disease, as it was dependent on social norms and circumstances. Ingelby pointed out that it was the apparent medical nature of the process that enabled it to act as a justification for the actions that followed. I describe the stories of two patients, which illustrate the themes Ingelby and Coulter identified. In particular they demonstrate that, in contrast to the idea that diagnosis should determine treatment, diagnoses in psychiatry are applied to justify predetermined social responses, designed to control and contain disturbed behaviour and provide care for dependents. Hence psychiatric diagnosis functions as a political device employed to legitimate activities that might otherwise be contested. Social Theory & Health (2010) 8, 370-382. doi: 10.1057/sth.2009.11
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Background: Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring frequent monitoring that may be accompanied by considerable quality of life (QOL) burden. Low-and middle-income countries such as Swaziland are facing a double disease burden exacerbated by the high prevalence of infectious diseases. This study aimed to understand the QOL and its correlates in diabetic outpatients in Swaziland. Methods: Participants were consecutively recruited during their routine visits to a referral hospital in Swaziland. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with outpatients using the Diabetes-39 questionnaire to measure their QOL. Raw scores were transformed to a standard domain-specific score using linear transformation with scores ranging from 0 (lowest impact) to 100 (highest impact). Results: Among the 340 participants in this cross-sectional study anxiety and worry was the most affected QOL domain. In multiple linear regression analyses, the presence of complications and/or comorbidities, low income, limited education and being on insulin therapy, showed higher impacts of diabetes on the participants' QOL. Conclusions: The high impact of diabetes on anxiety and worry QOL score highlights the need to address diabetic patients' psychological wellbeing in the clinical management of diabetes. An integrated diabetes care program that takes into account the impacts of sociodemographic and clinical factors on QOL may improve the QOL of diabetic patients.
Urban Studies	Urban transport projects have great potential to influence public space and the way we understand the city. Nowadays, the design and cost-benefit analysis of transport infrastructure projects in Chile consider attributes mainly related to transport. However, the implementation of transport projects can also give additional benefits to the environment, which are not being considered by current methodologies, although their costs of implementation and maintenance are included. This article proposes a methodology using stated preferences (sp) to evaluate urban attributes in the transport planning context, considering three urban attributes: Existence of green areas, bike paths and bus corridors. The attributes were found to have a positive valuation in all sectors, reaffirming the importance of the qualities and characteristics of urban spaces. Therefore, these positive benefits should be incorporated in future evaluations.
History Of Social Sciences	Pre-reform Chinese cities base their uniqueness in urban transformation on Mao's duality of utopian and revolutionary ideals and pragmatic and economized approaches in practice. Through the lens of urban economy, population management, and city planning, this paper examines China's pre-reform urban transformation. By the case study of Hangzhou, this research reveals that urban development was driven by a diverse set of forces devised by the communist state to configure the urban conditions and control people's daily lives in pursuit of radical socialist goals. The controls from the state and other pertinent forces led to the actual outcomes of political-economic ambitions and spatial policy rhetoric. It was an inherent feature of the society and economy to go outside of the state's controls, and the unintended consequences were unavoidable. The state had to revise their strategies, the outcomes of which were again to be tested by time. An iterative process determined the urban transformation of Chinese cities.
Linguistics	The subject of this study is the copy-verb construction {VERBAL_STEM=DISCOURSE_CLITICFINAL_VERB} in the Tibeto-Burman family, with particular emphasis on two languages, Burmese and Pumi. Both languages show a highly diverse functional span of this construction, thereby offering insights for its analysis and for our understanding of the interaction of verbal categories with information structure and context. The copy-verb construction of Pumi and Burmese is subsequently compared with parallel phenomena in Tibeto-Burman and is situated in a wider crosslinguistic perspective.
Sociology	In Mississippi counties with large African American populations, forest resources constitute one of the most important agricultural outputs. Despite the efforts of natural resources extension personnel to provide educational programming to this group, little is known about their needs, concerns, and meanings of the landscape for them. Research has taken place in the Carolinas, Alabama, and Georgia; however, forests and African American forest landowners in Mississippi face unique social, historical, and ecological contexts that need to be examined. If forests and forestry programs are to provide an equitable distribution of benefits to diverse populations in Mississippi, a culturally based understanding of landowners is needed with special attention to those populations who have been traditionally underserved because of race and income. We address this need by presenting data from focus groups with African American forest landowners in several rural Mississippi counties. Findings indicate that a complex relationship with the landscape has inculcated much traditional knowledge about forest resources, opportunities and challenges to participation in programs and landowner associations, and concerns over heir property, among other factors. We discuss implications for how forestry can meet the sustainable natural resource goals and rural development needs of African American landowners and communities.
Environmental Studies	Catch share programs can have far-reaching effects on coastal communities and the people that rely on fishing income, including crew members. Analysis of management actions affecting crew wages and well-being is often limited due to a dearth of available data. We examine crew-related outcomes during the first six years of the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program using two unique datasets - a mandatory economic survey and a voluntary social science study. We find that impacts on crew compensation differ from other catch share programs due to prior conditions of the fishery and also vary by the target species within the program. The median number of crew positions per vessel increased slightly, annual crew days decreased, and crew wage as a percentage of revenue was nearly unchanged, even with the introduction of new costs. Median daily crew compensation increased from $514 per day to $776 after implementation of catch shares and annual compensation increased from $33 thousand to $39 thousand. Many crew members expressed a lack of support for the program and job satisfaction did not rise with increased wages and fewer days at sea, indicating that job satisfaction is likely influenced by more than compensation and effort.
Rehabilitation	The aim of this study was to investigate the floor and ceiling effects of 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS). This was a cross-sectional survey study at a university's physical and rehabilitation medicine outpatient clinic of 1988 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Floor and ceiling effects were calculated as relative frequencies of the lowest or the highest possible scores for each item. The probit plotting method was used to detect the non-normality of distribution of the total score graphically. A significant floor effect of 15-79% was observed in all 12 WHODAS 2.0 items. A substantial floor effect for total score was also detected graphically. No ceiling effects were observed. In this study, a significant floor effect was found for all WHODAS 2.0 items among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain associated with mild or no disability.

Women'S Studies	There has been limited discursive space for Korean women in the sex and entertainment industries, particularly for those working overseas in countries including Australia, to narrate their experience. Bringing out the voices of these women to the forefront, this paper offers a nuanced understanding of their migration trajectories and working and living conditions. Neither the abolitionist nor the decriminalization approach fully understands how women in these industries fare. The former neglects the agency of women who voluntarily choose this work, while the latter tends to silence the women trafficked into the industry. These views fail to encompass women's complicated lived experience, often falling outside this binary. The 22 women interviewed here described their involvement in the industry as a short-lived and auxiliary part of their global exploration. Although they voluntarily chose such work, and despite its legal status, they still suffer from the stigma associated with it, while their working conditions are often deceptive, abusive and exploitative. The paper suggests that we need to transcend the dichotomy between the free and the trafficked assumed by both global and national policies regarding the sex trade, in order to develop policies and programs to support and protect these migrant women better.
Environmental Studies	Contradictions in various coal city aspects have become increasingly prominent, with many cities becoming locked in due to lack of overall planning and resource degradation, and sustainable development of coal cities has attracted widespread attention. However, many research challenges remain regarding breakthrough of coal city lock-in effect. This paper evaluated 43 typical Chinese coal city 2012-2016 lock-in breakthrough abilities considering economy, environment, and sustainable development capacity aspects. We then used the fixed effect model to analyze impact mechanisms for various influencing factors on lock-in breakthrough. We found there was no significant change in overall lock-in breakthrough capacity in recent years. Technological innovation and human resources played important roles in lock-in breakthrough, and higher secondary industry proportion implied poorer ability to lock in breakthroughs. Economic externality and government finance had no significantly affect. Therefore, the government should clarify coal city transformation goals, establish a typical city as a benchmark for others, accelerate alternative industry developments, increase talent introduction and personnel training, and insist that technological innovation solves urban development problems from the root.
International Relations	Since the end of the Cold War there has been a renaissance in the study of history by International Relations scholars. Constructivists have been at the forefront of this rediscovery, turning to historical inquiry to highlight the contingent meaning and evolution of a myriad of international practices, processes, and social structures. To what extent, however, is this work informed by a distinctive philosophy of history, explicit or implicit? Do constructivists read history in a particular way? If so, what are the contours of their approach? This article takes up these questions, arguing that constructivist history is essentially 'Skinnerian' in nature, marking it off from realist-materialist histories, on the one hand, and histories of ideas, on the other. To illustrate this approach I end with a brief constructivist reading of the constitutional crisis that beset the Spanish Empire in the aftermath of the Napoleonic invasion and usurpation in 1808.
Ethnic Studies	This paper explores the social reproduction of precarity among white South African migrants in Australia. Building on Griffiths and Prozesky's elucidation of the white South African imaginary and its role in triggering emigration, we draw on ethnographic data on white South Africans living in Melbourne to argue that our informants reproduce what Hage terms a white nation fantasy'. In documenting the ways our informants' migration experiences can be read as a function of a threatened social imaginary, we suggest that their successful' resettlement in Australia points to the congruence of their ontological grounding with the white nation fantasy predominating in Australia. Ultimately, however, we argue that the sense of precarity our informants experience in Australia is intrinsically embedded in their reproduction of the white nation fantasy. Our case study therefore serves as a cautionary tale to inflexible constructions of whiteness globally.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	To examine the extent of nutritional vulnerability seen in a cohort of asylum seekers in Australia. Twenty-one asylum seekers (15 males, 6 females) that used a food bank were interviewed over a 6 week period at the Melbourne based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre about foods consumed in the previous 24-h and any non food bank foods obtained. A basket audit was conducted after participants accessed the food bank on the day of interview, Participants obtained significantly less than the minimum requirements for the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating in the vegetables and legumes (P < .001, 95% CI -3.5, -1.7) fruits (P < .001, 95% CI -1.7, -.1.2), dairy (P < .001, 95% CI -1.8, -1.5) and meat and meat alternatives core food groups (P = .001, 95% CI -0.8, -0.3) using foods accessed from the food bank, their primary or sole food source. A high level of nutritional vulnerability was seen in this cohort due to their inability to meet minimum nutritional requirements from their primary food access point. Health professionals working with asylum seeker populations need to be aware of this issue and the resulting potential for longer term ill health as a consequence.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Incomplete unemployment data is a fundamental problem when evaluating labour market policies in several countries. Many unemployment spells end for unknown reasons; in the Swedish Public Employment Service's register as many as 20 percent. This leads to an ambiguity regarding destination states (employment, unemployment, retired, etc.). According to complete combined administrative data, the employment rate among dropouts was close to 50 for the years 1992 to 2006, but from 2007 the employment rate has dropped to 40 or less. This article explores an imputation approach. We investigate imputation models estimated both on survey data from 2005/2006 and on complete combined administrative data from 2005/2006 and 2011/2012. The models are evaluated in terms of their ability to make correct predictions. The models have relatively high predictive power.
Rehabilitation	Background. Adolescents with physical disabilities (PD) report difficulties making friends. Education in inclusive high schools may help to minimize these challenges. Purpose. This paper begins to answer the question: What is the nature of the friendships of adolescents with PD attending inclusive high schools? Methods. Standard qualitative methods were used to analyze the data of three multi-perspective case studies that included interviews of three adolescents with PD and their nominated friends, parents, and teachers. Based on these analyses, we describe the activities and the quality of the adolescents' interactions and relationships. Findings. Three unique patterns of friendship were identified: an extensive network of friendships, a core group of friends with an avid interest, and few friendships in or out of school. Implications. Successful development of friendships among adolescents with and without PD is complex and influenced by personal, environmental, interactional, and relationship factors.
Sociology	This article looks at the contribution of non-profit organisations to public action. It employs a conceptual arsenal usually applied to the analysis of street-level bureaucracy to depict day-to-day work in the field of access to justice for disadvantaged individuals. A case study on the implementation of a legal right to housing shows how non-profit actors play a policy-making role through their participation in the process of selecting the beneficiaries of public action. This entails the exercise of discretionary power in the legal characterisation of individual situations and the selection of cases to support or reasons to adduce in dealings with the administration, with the result that the outcomes for clients who receive social and legal support appear strongly improved.

History & Philosophy Of Science	"Mariangela Ardinghelli (1730-1825) is remembered as the Italian translator of two texts by the Newtonian physiologist Stephen Hales, Haemastaticks and Vegetable Staticks. This essay shows that her role in the Republic of Letters was by no means limited to such work. At a time of increasing interest in the natural history of the areas around Naples, she became a reliable cultural mediator for French travelers and naturalists. She also acted as an informal foreign correspondent for the Paris Academy of Sciences, connecting scientific communities in Naples and France. Unlike other learned women of the time, Ardinghelli was neither an aristocrat nor a member of the ascendant middle class. The essay discusses the strategies she devised to build her authority and her choice of anonymity at the apex of her popularity, when she translated scientific texts by contemporary celebrities such as the abbe Nollet and the comte de Buffon. It argues that, in spite of Ardinghelli's historical invisibility, for her contemporaries she never became an ""invisible assistant"": she constructed layers of selective visibility that allowed her authorship to be identified by specific audiences, while protecting herself from social isolation or derision."
Sociology	This research uses binary logistic regression to test for a connection between the race of interviewer and race of respondent on five questions in the General Social Survey about the use of physical force by the police. Results indicate two instances of race-of-interviewer effect: (1) black respondents were more likely to voice disapproval about whether the police can strike a citizen trying to escape when speaking to a black interviewer, and (2) white respondents were less likely to voice approval of police striking an adult male citizen in the presence of a black interviewer. Secondary findings indicate that education is consistently significant regardless of race of respondent and the survey question, while social class, sex, age, and region are significant in only limited scenarios.
Education & Educational Research	Over past decades we have witnessed considerable debate questioning the capacity of contemporary research to address the challenges posed by complex societal developments. As a consequence the need for rethinking cultures and practices of knowledge production has moved high on the policy agenda. In this context transdisciplinarity has become one of the key-notions standing for more openness towards and engagement with non-scientific actors all along the process of knowledge production. While there is much debate, little is known about the every-day research practices in such contexts. This paper focuses on early stage researchers and how they manage to reconcile the demands of transdisciplinarity with other normative requirements in contemporary research. Using the concept of 'epistemic living spaces', which addresses how researchers see their room for epistemic and social manoeuvre within research, the paper explores the possibilities and limits of contemporary research structures to accommodate this alternative way of producing knowledge. Introducing the concept of 'transdisciplinary knowledge regime', the article finally argues that this kind of knowledge production cannot be understood through solely focusing on the specific epistemological and normative prescriptions, but demands close consideration of the complex entanglements between the epistemic, the institutional, the social and the ideological perspectives in contemporary research. All this also raises new issues of responsibility towards early stage researchers.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	"Survey questionnaires commonly include retrospective questions on attitudes as a substitute for concurrently obtained assessments. Empirical studies have shown that these retrospectively obtained attitudes often deviate seriously from the attitudes for which they are substitutes: the attitude that respondents held in the past. In spite of this, hardly any research has been done to examine whether aided recall methods might be able to minimize such a discrepancy. The present study provides a first empirical test of a cue-list which was used as an aided recall method for retrospective attitude questions about unemployment. The cuelist consisted of a standardized set of cues - advantages and disadvantages of being unemployed - that was added to a retrospective attitude question on unemployment. It was tested in a randomized field experiment during the second wave (1991) of a longitudinal social survey in the Netherlands. The cue-list was expected to enhance the reconstruction of the past attitudes of those respondents who had actually been unemployed at the time of the first interview. Respondents who had not been unemployed were treated as a control group. The agreement between the recalled attitude and the attitude reported in the first wave of the survey, four years earlier, was used to evaluate the effects of the cue-list. Contrary to expectation, the cue-list led to a lower instead of a higher level of agreement. However, in line with Tulving's encoding specificity principle, the ""unemployment"" cue-list did have this unexpected effect only for the respondents who had been unemployed at the time of the first interview and not for the control group. In addition, the cue-list led to a more positive attitude towards unemployment, in retrospect, for the former group of respondents. Exploratory analyses suggest that the cues might have triggered positive features of unemployment that could have been easily overlooked otherwise. Based on the outcomes, the risks of applying cues are discussed."
Linguistics	We present a series of large-scale formal acceptability judgment studies that explored Norwegian island phenomena in order to follow up on previous observations that speakers of Mainland Scandinavian languages like Norwegian accept violations of certain island constraints that are unacceptable in most languages cross-linguistically. We tested the acceptability of wh-extraction from five island types: whether-, complex NP, subject, adjunct, and relative clause (RC) islands. We found clear evidence of subject and adjunct island effects on wh-extraction. We failed to find evidence that Norwegians accept wh-extraction out of complex NPs and RCs. Our participants judged wh-extraction from complex NPs and RCs to be just as unacceptable as subject and adjunct island violations. The pattern of effects in Norwegian paralleled island effects that recent experimental work has documented in other languages like English and Italian (Sprouse et al. 2012, 2016). Norwegian judgments consistently differed from prior findings for one island type: whether-islands. Our results reveal that Norwegians exhibit significant inter-individual variation in their sensitivity to whether-island effects, with many participants exhibiting no sensitivity to whether-island violations whatsoever. We discuss the implications of our findings for universalist approaches to island constraints. We also suggest ways of reconciling our results with previous observations, and offer a systematic experimental framework in which future research can investigate factors that govern apparent island insensitivity.
Law	"This Article examines the likelihood of the emergence of an alternative center for investment arbitration - a very much debated, if not favored, option in some policy circles. We argue that given the current market dominance of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (""ICSID""), the emergence of institutional competition from other regions of the world is constrained by network effects. Network effects arise when the value that consumers derive from a good increases as others also use the good. (Language is the classic example.) As more users adopt the good and its utility is enhanced, additional consumers flock to the good, creating positive feedback. When a market has settled upon a single standard, the market is said to have ""tipped."" This gives rise to a monopoly-type situation that prevents potential rivals from successfully challenging the market dominance of the prevailing standard, creating what is known as ""institutional lock-in."" After explaining the concept of institutional lock-in, we explore its salience in the investment arbitration realm. We find that this model is robust and its impact discernible in the current investment arbitration environment. Notwithstanding this finding, certain exogenous events could substantially reduce or even annihilate this effect. To this end, potential ""disruptive events"" - such as the European Union's push for an investment ""court,"" potential competition from the Permanent Court of Arbitration (""PCA"") or other arbitration centers, and unforeseen legislative changes - are explored. These events could undermine the market dominance of ICSID and trigger either a large-scale coalescence around an alternative institution or, rather more likely, the parceling out of investment arbitration among multiple competitors until the market again coalesces around a new standard. However, we conclude that in the absence of a strong exogenous shock, the institutional lock-in of ICSID will be difficult to dislodge."
Geography	U.S. housing policy strengthens the local specificity of capital through support for homeownership and the mortgage lending industry. As access to capital and homeownership rates have grown, predatory lending has emerged as a significant danger to homeowners and their surrounding communities. The geographic distribution is not well understood, likely due to the unavailability of mortgage data to identify instances of predatory lending. This article examines the spatial distribution of predatory lending in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, using public mortgage and property data. Predatory lending is spatially clustered within the city, suggesting a spatial component of abusive lending patterns not previously addressed. U.S. housing policy and intervention strategies designed to prevent and reduce the incidence of predatory lending should address the spatial aspects of predatory lending to target efforts and prevent weakening local connections between capital and communities.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between insulin resistance and changes in body composition in older men without diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study of older men participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. SETTING: Six U.S. clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred thirty-two ambulatory men aged 65 and older at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline insulin resistance was calculated for men without diabetes mellitus using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Total lean, appendicular lean, total fat, and truncal fat mass were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans at baseline and 4.6 perpendicular to 0.3 years later in 3,132 men with HOMA-IR measurements. RESULTS: There was greater loss of weight, total lean mass, and appendicular lean mass and less gain in total fat mass and truncal fat mass with increasing quartiles of HOMA-IR (P<.001 for trend). Insulin-resistant men in the highest quartile had higher odds of 5% or more loss of weight (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46-2.43), total lean mass (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.60-2.73) and appendicular lean mass (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.27-1.95) and lower odds of 5% or more gain in total fat mass (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.45-0.68) and truncal fat mass (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.42-0.64) than those in the lowest quartile. These findings remained significant after accounting for age, site, baseline weight, physical activity, and change in physical activity. These associations were also independent of other metabolic syndrome features and medications. CONCLUSION: Greater lean mass loss and lower fat mass gain occurred in insulin-resistant men without diabetes mellitus than in insulin-sensitive men. Insulin resistance may accelerate age-related sarcopenia. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:1217-1224, 2011.
Family Studies	Giving support may be a stressful or rewarding experience, and little is known about how family members perceive giving support amid problems or crises. Using a sample of 226 mother-child dyads (mother mean age = 75.04 years; child mean age = 49.57 years), we examine how mothers and their middle-aged children perceive giving support in the context of life problems. Actor-partner interdependence models tested whether associations between problems and perceptions of support are moderated by frequency of support given and if associations were stronger for daughters or sons. Children perceived giving support to their mother as more stressful when they had more of their own problems and gave high levels of support. Daughters, but not sons, considered helping their mother more stressful when their mother had more problems and they gave high levels of support. Distinctions between mother-son and mother-daughter dyads demonstrate the merit of a dyadic approach to understanding mother-child relationships.
Business, Finance	"We examine whether financial expert audit committee members tailor their approach to overseeing the corporate tax planning process according to the firm""s business strategy. We predict and find that such directors encourage defender-type firms (characterized partially by high risk aversion) to engage in more tax avoidance activities and prospector-type firms (characterized partially by innovation and risk seeking) to scale back on tax avoidance, relative to the opposing strategy type. We also find that both accounting experts and non-accounting financial experts on the audit committee contribute to our results to some extent, although the effects of non-accounting financial experts present more consistently. Overall, our results suggest that financial experts on the audit committee tend to play more of an advising role for defenders and more of a monitoring role for prospectors, relative to one another."
Sociology	Arguments that migrants represent a threat to the Britain are often cast in terms of impact on the economy and a criminal threat to Britain's streets. We examine the impact of these attitudes on support for policies curtailing the rights of European Union (EU) and non-EU migrants in the United Kingdom separately, as well as their implications for support for punitive criminal sanctions. Using data on a nationally representative sample of Britons, results indicate that perceptions of migrants as a criminal threat have a greater effect on support for curtailing rights of EU migrants, more so than economic threat, suggesting that British citizens invoke deep rooted stereotypes about EU migrants as criminal when choosing their preferences. Criminal threat is also associated with support for more punitive criminal sanctions. Thus, threat narratives, especially narratives of immigrant crime, could be instrumental in public support for policy, but different narratives are associated with EU and non-EU migrants.
Health Policy & Services	In Spain, the use of generics has considerably evolved in a short period of time through different anti crisis legislation changes. Before the financial crisis the proposal of generics was an option for patients. Nowadays its use is actively enforced by Health authorities. Objective: To explore the perceptions of pharmacists and physicians regarding the generic substitution driven by new Spanish drugs policies as well as their adaptive strategies intended to lessen the impact of changes to their patients' treatment. Methods: Pharmacists (16) and physicians (13) from Ferrol and A Coruna participated in a qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results: Qualitative analysis allowed identification of nine key components in the substitution process: Enabling factors: 'Adequate information to patients', 'Acute treatments', 'Bioappearance', 'Prescription by Estate Official Denomination followed by laboratory name', 'Personalized dosage systems'. Obstructing factors: 'Generics/Authorities distrust', 'Lack of time', 'Patient characteristics', 'Pharmacy financial management'. Conclusions: Pharmacists and physicians in our economic crisis context perceive different barriers resulting in difficulties in the generic substitution process. They have implemented strategies to capitalize on the enablers and overcome the additional budget-cut barriers imposed by the Administration that had prevented them from maintaining their patient's treatment preferences. Spanish health authorities could improve current legislation either by reducing the number of new laboratories of authorized generic manufacturers or by extending the pharmacist capability for equivalent drugs substitution.

Transportation	The reasons for, and the implications arising from, the underrepresentation of women on the flightdeck of commercial aircraft continues to challenge national Governments, the aviation industry, and the academic community. Although some airlines have made concerted efforts to improve the gender balance of their flightcrew, womens' participation in the profession remains low. Of the 130,000 airline pilots worldwide only 4000 (3%) are women and only 450 hold the command of Captain. The dominant historical discourse of airline pilots as assertive masculine figures may act to dissuade women from pursuing a career on the flightdeck and women pilots are subjected to sexist remarks and behaviour from colleagues and passengers. Given commercial aviation's increasing growth worldwide and the concurrent increase in demand for highly skilled labour, the inability to recruit and retain women pilots represents a significant problem for both the sector and the wider economy as it will constrain growth, hinder aviation's expansion by failing to capitalise on women's skill sets, and delay the achievement of gender equality. Understanding the experiences of flightcrew is therefore vital in addressing this important research problem. Through the use of in-depth interviews with men and women flightcrew in the UK, the research identifies a number of obstacles to greater female participation and recommends that airlines not only focus on gender differences in learning, leadership and communication but that they also take steps to more effectively manage diversity in their workforce and actively promote positive representations of women flightcrew both within and beyond their organisation.

Environmental Studies	The Blue Economy is an ocean based economic growth model gaining traction around the world. The way in which the Blue Economy is conceived and understood differs significantly across different sets of actors. A particular area of contestation exists around which ocean based industries or sectors can be considered to be 'Blue'. This highlights the possibility of the Blue Economy becoming a forum through which the legitimacy of different private uses of ocean resources is contested and debated. The question of legitimacy of Blue Economy activities and sectors is explored through a critical engagement with the notion of a 'social license to operate' (SLO). Whilst SLO is normally considered in the context of individual businesses or developments, in this article we explore the applicability of SLO at a cross-sectoral scale. In doing so we examine how the concept of SLO may inform debates over appropriate private use of public ocean resources, and how this might influence the legitimacy of the broader concept of a Blue Economy. A case study involving a range of private sectors actors engaged in diverse ocean industries was conducted, drawing on interviews, a cross-sectoral survey and an interactive workshop with the ocean business community. The case study explores the role that SLO is currently playing in ocean industries. In particular we explore perceptions of who grants a SLO, what kind of concerns impact a SLO and how sectors work to obtain, or maintain, a SLO. By comparing the responses of individual sectors to these three critical questions, we identify that many of the SLO challenges currently being experienced by ocean industries relate to conflicting social and political values. This is creating a range of complex, sometimes irresolvable, SLO challenges for maritime industries, largely concentrated in sectors engaged in resource extraction, such as mining and oil and gas. In addition we find that attempts to address SLO challenges to date focus mostly on technical or technological adaptations. When comparing this to Blue Economy narratives we find that current engagement with SLO speaks primarily to interpretations of the Blue Economy which favour growth based narratives, and largely neglect competing discourses. This has considerable implications for the overall legitimacy of the Blue Economy, as the loss of SLO within one sector may undermine the credibility of the concept overall. This research highlights the importance of broader societal and political engagement in questions about appropriate use and management of private sector activities in the ocean.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	The historic centre of Palma is undergoing significant socio-urban change due to tourism-real estate speculation-an issue that is constantly highlighted in debates on tourism gentrification. This revaluation of the historic centre as a place for investment coincided with a serious economic crisis and an increase in urban inequality throughout the city. Tourism gentrification is spreading throughout neighbourhoods in the old town, most notably in areas with high heritage value. Our aim herein is to examine tourism gentrification in the historic centre of Palma through the increase in luxury hotels and short-stay holiday home rentals, particularly those listed on Airbnb, as the two most recent agents of gentrification. The advent of social resistance to this phenomenon can be tied to the socio-urban impacts that have stemmed from this tourism speculation: financial (real estate speculation and rising property prices), social (evictions), and functional and scenic (symbolic and commercial transformation). The strongest political response has come in the recent Tourism Act (August 2017) introducing certain regulatory measures: firstly, the focus on the illegal nature of renting holiday accommodation and, secondly, tourism zoning which, in Palma, has led to a complete ban on holiday rentals in residential apartment blocks. Palma is the first city in Spain to opt for this solution.
Ethnic Studies	Barack Obama was more successful in the South in the 2008 election than many previous Democratic presidential nominees had been. While John McCain continued Republican dominance in the conservative region, it was a major breakthrough for a northern liberal Democrat, especially an African American from Illinois, to win three southern states and secure 55 electoral votes. Florida, North Carolina and Virginia were good opportunities for Obama because, demographically, they had come to resemble other large states outside the South. In these 'converging' southern states, the Latino and Asian communities had grown substantially. The percentage of college-educated Whites had increased and there had been large-scale migration from other regions of the country. The states that Obama won in the South were not as 'southern' as they once were. In some southern states, those called the 'neo-Confederate South' in this article, white support for Obama was less than John Kerry had received in 2004. This decline in white voting for the Democratic presidential nominee occurred despite the difficult economic times that enveloped the country in the months preceding the election, and the general unpopularity of the incumbent Republican administration headed by George W. Bush. Some of these states, like Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, had been among the most intransigent states in resisting the claims of the civil rights movement for social and political equality for African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. In the future it may be more accurate to speak of more than one South, rather than refer to the region as an undifferentiated whole.
International Relations	Why might public acknowledgment of cooperative security negotiations generate bargaining constraints that provoke stalemate? Previous scholarship points to aroused public opinion. Yet in many cases where hard-line bargaining stances develop and talks collapse following public acknowledgment, it is not domestic political pressures that tie leaders' hands. This article examines instead an international constraint attendant to publicity: opposition by third-party states. I argue that international power position shapes the balance of vulnerability between the negotiating parties to abandonment and entanglement. The act of official acknowledgment can constrain the more vulnerable partner by enabling third-party states to credibly scrutinize its intentions. By threatening strained relations, such scrutiny can create a security dilemma that reduces the weaker partner's bargaining range to a choice between cooperation on its terms and noncooperation. I evaluate this argument by studying foreign military basing negotiations. Statistical analyses and a comparative case study produce strong support for my argument.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This research adopts the system dynamics method from complex science to develop a model to address conflicts of development among interest groups in the context of cultural tourism. This study deploys various surveys at different cultural heritage sites and incorporates findings from a literature review of industrial development motives within the fields of economics, geography, sociology, and tourism. Consequently, this research identifies critical factors related to the evolution of the cultural tourism system. Based on these factors, we present a dynamic model including (1) 3 level variables, (2) 6 rate variables, and (3) 35 auxiliary variables. We discuss the three sub-systems of the derived model and the relationships among these sub-systems. The dynamic model suggests that cultural tourism managers should evaluate the benefits of cultural assets, protective investment ratios, crowding ratios, and resident tourism participation ratios as key leverage points in sustaining the development of cultural tourism.
Cultural Studies	Following aluminum as part of a material culture of speed and lightness, this article examines how assemblages of energy and metals connect built environments, ways of life, and ideologies of acceleration. Aluminum can be theorized as a circulatory matrix that forms an energy culture. Through a discussion of speed and social justice, the history of aluminium-based socioecologies reveals how the materiality of energy forms assemblages of objects, infrastructures, and practices. The article then traces the aluminum industry's involvement in the production and distribution of energy itself both at the national scale of power grids and in the emergence of transnational transfers of energy, such as hydropowered smelters in Iceland. Finally, this analysis of deeply embedded energy cultures calls for a transnational approach to the accelerated socioecologies of aluminum production and consumption; and for energy transition theories to pay closer attention to the figured worlds and figuring work of the military-industrial complex.
Education, Special	Cooperation is an observable and measurable relationship skill identified within social and emotional learning paradigms. Although cooperation plays a role in the academic and behavioral development of students, educators may not have the time, expertise, or motivation to target cooperation skills explicitly. Self-monitoring, grounded in reactivity theory, is an evidence-based practice that can help students improve their cooperation skills. The use of mnemonics is a common practice to assist in identifying the important components of any intervention. Using mnemonics and self-monitoring is efficient for academic and social skills. Combining them to improve cooperation skills would produce both academic and social benefit while allowing the teacher to maintain classroom instruction. The article illustrates the pairing of mnemonics and self-monitoring to target cooperation skills with explicit instruction for implementation.
Urban Studies	Racial/ethnic inequality is a common feature of urban life. This paper attempts to identify spatial structures that contribute to disparities in White and minority incomes. In a study of 49 core based statistical areas (CBSAs) in the U.S., we analyze 2016 data on racial/ethnic income inequality, 2010 data on minority-White segregation, and 2014 data on job accessibility through transit, driving and pedestrian transportation networks. We find that Black and Latino incomes are far lower than White incomes where the former are more segregated and if transit, driving, and pedestrian networks are more efficient, i.e., residents can access a larger proportion of metro area employment opportunities during the morning rush hour. For Latinos, these effects are independent of each other. For Blacks, they are substitutes. We conclude by offering various explanations for why transit and pedestrian networks, in particular, could contribute to racial inequality.
Demography	Forecasts of life expectancy (LE) have fuelled debates about the sustainability and dependability of pension and healthcare systems. Of relevance to these debates are inequalities in LE by education. In this paper, we present a method of forecasting LE for different educational groups within a population. As a basic framework we use the Li-Lee model that was developed to forecast mortality coherently for different groups. We adapted this model to distinguish between overall, sex-specific, and education-specific trends in mortality, and extrapolated these time trends in a flexible manner. We illustrate our method for the population aged 65 and over in the Netherlands, using several data sources and spanning different periods. The results suggest that LE is likely to increase for all educational groups, but that differences in LE between educational groups will widen. Sensitivity analyses illustrate the advantages of our proposed method.
Law	"Modern jury selection is pulled in two directions. Equal protection prohibits racial discrimination, but the traditional peremptory strike permits exclusion of a juror without explanation. To reconcile this tension, the Court developed the Batson framework, requiring lawyers to articulate ex post race-neutral justifications for suspicious strikes. But many doubt Batson's efficacy at uncovering latent discrimination. During the 2015-16 term, while recognizing a Batson violation in Foster v. Chatman, the Supreme Court counter-intuitively reinforced this concern. Foster is the rare case in which prosecutors documented in writing their reliance on race. A framework that depends on such transparency is weak and ineffective. And the systemic persistence of discrimination, three decades after Batson was decided, has convinced many that the only solution is to eliminate peremptory strikes in their entirety. In this Article, I offer an alternative strategy. I introduce a new mechanism to reform - but not entirely eliminate - the system of peremptory challenges: the ""hybrid jury strike."" Hybrid strikes would fall in between traditional peremptory challenges, which may be exercised at the party's discretion, and challenges for cause, which may be granted only upon an adequate showing of juror bias or other basis for disqualification. Hybrid strikes would require ex ante justification but not a conclusive showing of bias; they could be used to exclude a set number of jurors who survived non-pretextual and meaningful cause challenges. Hybrid strikes could replace traditional peremptories wholesale or could be leveraged asymmetrically - for example, by preserving traditional peremptories for the defense while permitting only hybrid strikes for the prosecution. Hybrid strikes offer an intermediate approach between the status quo and complete abolition of peremptory challenges. They would meaningfully curtail discrimination while preserving the most legitimate function of peremptory challenges: to foster jury impartiality by providing a buffer zone for cause challenges when evidence of bias is credible but insufficient or when judges erroneously reject them."
Sociology	The development and proliferation of new information and communication technologies has generated some profound claims about the erasure of place. Whilst these claims have continued political and policy resonance, they are increasingly challenged in sociological debate, which emphasizes the persistence of the local. Following this lead, our article explores relations between technology and place. We develop our understanding through engagement with Science and Technology Studies, Actor Network Theory and geographical conceptualizations of place. Our argument is worked through a new empirical study of telemedicine, where new technologies are applied precisely to overcome place. Our analysis is that, on the contrary, empirical outcomes are legible only through the lens of place. This has important policy implications and broader implications for thinking about technology in contemporary debates about globalization.
Law	The Romer case presented the European Court of Justice with an opportunity to extend its decision from earlier case law, that the prohibition of age discrimination is a specific expression of the general EU law principle of equality, to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Had the Court done so, this would have strengthened the argument that all grounds on which discrimination is prohibited reflect general principles of EU law, which would give these prohibitions de facto direct effect. However, contrary to the Opinion of the Advocate General, the Court of Justice did not do so and this article argues that its decision was an opportunity missed.
History	"This article explores transnational connections between anti-imperialist groups in West Germany and Japan through an examination of the protest around the Japanese Emperor""s state visit to Bonn in 1971. Although anti-imperialist movements in Japan and West Germany had many similarities and moments of contact, there are few treatments of these groups in transnational perspective. The event offers a unique moment of entanglement between New Left groups in the global 1960s and a rare moment of mutual discussion of the Japanese and German wartime past. The Showa Emperor (better known as Hirohito) traveled to Europe as a way to promote a new, peaceful, Japan; however, his role as a wartime leader complicated this image. Hirohito""s presence in West Germany presented major issues of wartime crimes that were filtered through German""s own memory of perpetration and victimhood. Radical students in and West Germany responded to the Emperor""s visit by cooperating with Japanese exchange students to analyze and protest the history of Japanese militarism and fascism - and also its postwar attempts to regain an empire, especially in Southeast Asia and Vietnam. These concepts were seen, therefore, on another level: the US war in Vietnam, and Japanese and West German complicity in this conflict."
Family Studies	In this article, I explore the potential in producing queerer intersectional family scholarship for the advancement of theory. I offer an analysis of the ways queer theory enriches family scholarship while remaining critical of how its inattention to race as an identity category has limited its potential and scholarly theorizing across difference. I highlight queer Latinx family research to illustrate some of the nuance that is missing in scholarship that centers only a White middle-class subject. I suggest that scholars take note of how queer feminists of color have approached building theory in the flesh. I offer that queerer intersectional family scholarship should occur from the borderlands. Doing so furthers an important goal in queerer family scholarship: to better attend to lived experience and develop a more intersectional theory.
Management	This paper reports on a breakthrough in thinking based on 33 years of field practice-based inquiry and previously published studies. It brings together several bodies of established and emerging thought including systems thinking, epistemology, psychology and sociology, in a way of thinking about the living fabric of complex human systems-in-process. It is offered here as a kind of transdisciplinary Rosetta stone' to those working around the world with one or more of these bodies of thought as a way of making some critical connections between them. In summary, an integrating mental architecture' is proposed whereby inquiry (research as an evaluative dynamic act of seeking) may be seen as the way by which living (notably human) systems come alive, and which is incorporated, organ-ised, structured' and relationally embodied in an individual and their psychological mind as personal process, and in social collectivities and their sociological organisation as cultural process.
Political Science	This article, which examines the factors and processes that account for the negative correlation between Muslim majority states and democratization, focuses on the institutionalization of Islam in the state. I assess the effect of this factor along with other determinants on regime type from 1990 to 2002 in the population of fifty-one Muslim-majority states, using a multilevel mixed effects linear regression model and path analysis. The analysis shows that although Islam is arguably the most conspicuous factor characterizing this set of states, the institutionalization of Islam in the state is not an impediment to democratization. Instead, factors particularly associated with the Middle East and North Africa, as well as a communist legacy, delay meaningful democratic reform. The results of various regression models suggest that the states in this region with a better propensity toward democratic change are Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Yemen.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This comparative policy analysis demonstrates that patterns of truancy by immigrant status reflect the degree of systemic (anti-)discrimination institutionalized at the societal level. Based on extensive data from 205,512 children in 9,141 secondary schools across 29 OECD countries, a series of hierarchical generalized linear modeling analyses has been conducted. The results indicate that the extent to which a country has institutionalized antidiscrimination policies attenuates the association between immigrant status and school truancy for both first- and second-generation immigrants. This pattern gives credence to the postulation that an occurrence of truancy is not merely an aberrant behavior but a social incident that mirrors the larger structure in which social goods and opportunities are distributed unevenly across different groups of people. This new insight sheds light on the possibility that immigrant children may benefit from truancy reduction interventions to a greater degree in countries with adequate legal and administrative measures for anti-discrimination.

Ethics	Various forms of research are essential in emergency, disaster and disease outbreak situations, but challenges exist including the long length of time it takes to get research proposals approved. Consequently, it would be very advantageous to have an acceptable model for efficient coordination and communication between and among research ethics committees/IRBs and ministries of health, and templates for expediting (done with speed and efficiency) ethical review of research proposals in emergency and epidemic situations to be used across the Caribbean and in other low and middle income countries. This project involved a literature search and the interviewing of ministry of health officials, public health practitioners, and research ethics committee/IRB members in Jamaica and St. Lucia, to obtain suggestions for the best model for efficient coordination and communication between research ethics committees (RECs), and developed a template for expediting review of research protocols in epidemic and emergency conditions.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"In 1846 a photograph of a drawing of an Egyptian inscription in hieroglyphics was printed in the workshop of William Henry Fox Talbot who had not only invented the Calotype, but was also an ambitious Antiquarian. Even though the photograph did not render the original Egyptian inscription but only a drawing, the so-called ""The Talbotype applied to Hieroglyphics"" became a landmark as a scientific image. It was the first instance of the use of photography in the field of Egyptology. Despite Talbot's earlier attempts to convince scholars to use photography in the field, the archaeologists and trustees of the British Museum were not immediately convinced. This paper will explore the early debates about the use of photography for archaeological research and explain why ""The Talbotype applied to Hieroglyphics"" stands out in a period which could be described as the delayed career of the photographic image in archaeology."
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of geriatric syndromes in the premorbid for all syndromes except falls (preadmission), admission, and discharge assessment periods and the incidence of new and significant worsening of existing syndromes at admission and discharge. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three acute care hospitals in Brisbane, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred seventy-seven general medical patients aged 70 and older admitted to the hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of syndromes in the premorbid (or preadmission for falls), admission, and discharge periods; incidence of new syndromes at admission and discharge; and significant worsening of existing syndromes at admission and discharge. RESULTS: The most frequently reported premorbid syndromes were bladder incontinence (44%), impairment in any activity of daily living (ADL) (42%). A high proportion (42%) experienced at least one fall in the 90 days before admission. Two-thirds of the participants experienced between one and five syndromes (cognitive impairment, dependence in any ADL item, bladder and bowel incontinence, pressure ulcer) before, at admission, and at discharge. A majority experienced one or two syndromes during the premorbid (49.4%), admission (57.0%), or discharge (49.0%) assessment period. The syndromes with a higher incidence of significant worsening at discharge (out of the proportion with the syndrome present premorbidly) were ADL limitation (33%), cognitive impairment (9%), and bladder incontinence (8%). Of the syndromes examined at discharge, a higher proportion of patients experienced the following new syndromes at discharge (absent premorbidly): ADL limitation (22%); and bladder incontinence (13%). CONCLUSION: Geriatric syndromes were highly prevalent. Many patients did not return to their premorbid function and acquired new syndromes. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:2001-2008, 2011.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Currently, the concept of the cell as a society or an ecosystem of molecular elements is gaining increasing acceptance. The basic idea arose in the 19th century, from the surmise that there is not just a single unit underlying an individual's appearance, but a plurality of entities with both collaborative and conflicting relationships. The following hypothesis is based around this model. The incompatible activities taking place between different original elements, which were subsumed into the first cell and could not be eliminated, had to be controlled very closely. Similarly, a strong level of control had to be developed over many cellular elements after the cell changed its genome to DNA. We assume that at least some of those original RNA agents and other biomolecules which carry incompatibilities and risks, are retained within current cells, although they are now under strict control. A virus functions as a signal informing these repressed cellular RNAs and other elements of ancient origin how to restore suppressed degrees of molecular freedom, favoring pre-existing molecular affinities and activities, re-establishing ancient molecular webs of interactions, and giving fragments of ancient coded information (mostly in the form of RNA structural motifs) the opportunity to be re-expressed. Collectively, these newly activated mechanisms lead to different possibilities for pathological cell states. All these processes are opposed by cell-control mechanisms. Thus, in this new scenario, the battle is considered intracellular rather than between the virus and the cell. And so the virus is treated as the signal that precipitates the cell's change from a latent to an active pathological state.
Social Issues	PERCEPTION OF FAMILY FINANCIAL STATUS AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING Marina Ajdukovic, Linda Rajhvajn Bulat Department of Social Work, Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb Zagreb, Croatia The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the connection between perception of family financial status with some psychosocial internalized and externalized problems of high school students. The results for two subsamples of study which included 558 2nd grade students are presented: 70 students who perceive that their family has less or much less money than other families and 69 students who perceive that their family has more or much more money than other families. The youth who perceive that their family has less financial opportunities have more emotional problems and problems with peers, are less satisfied with their family relationships and are more exposed to psychological abuse by their parents. These two groups of high school students do not differ regarding experienced and committed peer violence, prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity, behaviour problems and experienced physical abuse by their parents. The results are analysed in the context of the youths' psychological vulnerability regarding poor financial family status.
History Of Social Sciences	In this article, the role of music in early experimental psychology is examined. Initially, the research of Wilhelm Wundt is considered, as tone sensation and musical elements appear as dominant factors in much of his work. It is hypothesized that this approach was motivated by an understanding of psychology that dates back to Christian Wolff's focus on sensation in his empirical psychology of 1732. Wolff, however, had built his systematization of psychology on Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, who combined perception with mathematics, and referred to music as the area in which sensation is united with numerical exactitude. Immanuel Kant refused to accept empirical psychology as a science, whereas Johann Friedrich Herbart reintroduced the scientific basis of empirical psychology by, among other things, referring to music.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Recently, public health has turned its attention to walking as physical exercise, with an assumption that increased levels of walking will improve population health through direct physiological effects on the walker, and through the beneficial environmental impact of more 'active transport' in a car-dominated transport system. Although there is evidence to support these assumptions, this paper suggests there may be limits to the effectiveness of current policy initiatives because they do not adequately attend to the social organization of walking. Walking is simultaneously experienced as biological reality and as intricately socially constructed. This paper draws on the small literature on the sociology of walking and data on leisure walking as an example to explore how the cultural politics of walking might contribute to an understanding useful for public health. It is suggested that an adequate conceptualization of walking needs to take into account the ways in which it is both socially embodied, relating to the ways in which we learn to move our physical bodies in appropriate ways, but also embedded, in that it relates to the movement of bodies through and in relation to particular material and social environments, with particular ideological effects.

Education & Educational Research	From a socioepistomological view, the intertwined social practices and self-generated social representations, establish a dialog different from the prevailing school discourse. In this report, we reflect about mathematics majors' argumentations about the geometric construction of the quadratic and logarithm functions using a geometric dynamic system. This work has been developed using the engineering didactic as a research method hence we include some reflections from the mathematical school discourse, from the epistemology of the logarithm function, and a brief state of the art about these notions.
Ethics	The ethical practices of psycho therapy researchers were surveyed online. A total of 257 completed surveys were received from researchers worldwide. Eighty-nine percent of researchers admitted to at least one of the listed behaviors. The most common faults were related to excessive work demands: 44% of the respondents reported inadequate monitoring of research projects due to work overload and 37% reported cutting corners in a hurry to complete a project. North America was lower in almost all of the reported behaviors. The results about specific behaviors related to psychotherapy research for which rules are still fuzzy reflect the disagreement among researchers. The high prevalence of misbehavior in psychotherapy research is a warning that cannot be ignored.
Linguistics	This paper centers on the nature of Spanish TP-ellipsis (e. g., Juan fue al cine y Maria tambien, lit. 'Juan went to the cinema and Mary also'), paying special attention to its behavior in contexts of long extraction of the remnant of the elliptical site. The long extraction data provide further evidence that TP-ellipsis in Spanish behaves as Clitic Left Dislocation. In particular, TP-ellipsis is sensitive to adjunct and relative islands. These facts lead us to the question of why other cases of TP-ellipsis, namely, sluicing, can indeed repair islands. I show that an approach such as the one in Merchant (2004, 2008) is not able to derive this pattern and propose an alternative solution. Assuming that ellipsis and copy deletion form a natural class (Chomsky 1993, 1995), I argue that the presence or absence of island repair effects is derived as a matter of identity. Basically, a phrasal copy is elided under the same mechanism that applies in normal cases of ellipsis. A copy that is elided in a given syntactic cycle is not computed for the identity condition on ellipsis in a later cycle. By contrast, if a copy cannot be elided in a syntactic cycle, it has to be computed for identity reasons at the ellipsis cycle. Under the assumption that indefinites and traces of wh-phrases are identical for the purposes of identity, it follows that ellipsis under wh-sluicing can feed elision of the wh-copies in the elliptical gap when there is an explicit indefinite in the correlate. This is never the case with Spanish TP-ellipsis because the copies of a left dislocated remnant never have an identical correlate in the antecedent.
Urban Studies	"Using the lens of informal Roma settlements in the southwestern periphery of Rome, this article explores Romani approaches to urban space, showing how these are informed by heterogeneous understandings of non-Roma conceptions and practices of (in)formality, (il)legality and (il)licitness. The article also highlights complex and ambivalent attitudes concerning Roma and their informal settlements on the part of non-Roma residents of the neighboring district. Finally, it frames the existence of the informal settlements within the authorities"" juggling of formal rejection and informal calculated acceptance of urban informality. The grey spaces that emerge from the convergence of institutional pragmatics of compromise and compassion are connected to governmental discourses that frame informal Roma settlements as dangerous and polluting spaces, and treat their inhabitants as exploitable labor force and politically expendable subjects. Urban (in)formality is also the space that Roma, like many non-Roma, navigate to cope with vulnerability and express their right to the city. Informal Roma settlements thus appear fully embedded in the political, socio-economic and cultural fabric of Rome, which embraces them precisely by treating them as separate polluting spaces."
Women'S Studies	This paper looks at the establishment of Women's Studies programs in selected Australian universities. It highlights the resistance to Women's Studies as an academic knowledge by some feminists outside of the academy as well as non-feminists within the academy. 1 This paper argues that connections to the Women's Liberation Movement and the difficulties encountered by feminists when introducing Women's Studies into the academy made some feminists suspicious of the value of theory for feminism, especially in relation to a political agenda. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. (Austen, Persuasion ([1818] 1946)
Communication	The study extends research on the Proteus effect by demonstrating that avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings. Experiment 1 shows that, after virtual group discussions, participants using black-cloaked avatars developed more aggressive intentions and attitudes but less group cohesion than those using white-cloaked avatars. In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan (KKK)-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the KKK avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.
Industrial Relations & Labor	This study compares the effectiveness of bargaining institutions in regulating temporary contracts in Austrian, German and Spanish call centres. Unions' capacities to bargain over the expansion and conditions of temporary contract use are shaped by bargaining structures and state regulation of various temporary contract types. National capacities to regulate the use of outsourcing and coordinate collective agreements with workplace bargaining are particularly effective in limiting the use of temporary contracts. Nonetheless, cross-national analysis indicates that employers are adept at exploiting very specific forms of temporary contracts in order to circumvent regulations and evade collective bargaining.
Political Science	What role does associational activism play in political life in the Middle East and North Africa? Have associations been largely co-opted, thus reinforcing authoritarian governance? Or are they part of drawn out democratization processes, emerging over the last two decades, exploding during the Arab Spring? Divergences in responses to these questions have been striking. From initial optimism about the potential of associations to contribute to democratization, much recent literature has been increasingly pessimistic, framing associations as part of the problem of failed political transformations. Algeria, in particular, despite minimal donor funding, has seen a surge in associations over the last 20 years. Yet, these 93,000 new associations have come under scrutiny. Building on extensive fieldwork, this article explores Algerian associations at grass-roots level, after the decade of violence in the 1990s. It analyses how associations challenged the state during the Arab Spring, how they question historical state narratives and challenge government policies. Despite political and structural obstacles, it is found that Algerian civic associations do not inhibit democratic society, indeed they enable it, not necessarily as transformative actors, but as meaningful democratic agents pushing for reform.
Social Work	In this article, I reflect on the ethical and culturally sensitive aspects of knowledge production in research involving Indigenous peoples. I examine the key findings of a case study of Sami welfare experiences and discuss their significance for the salient qualities of Indigenous methodology: the relational, reflexive and contextual. The aim is to gain insights into doing research in a good way' - that is competent, responsible and respectful and that contributes to culturally relevant knowledge from the Sami perspective. The analysis indicates that a heightened sense of culture is needed together with enhanced opportunities for dialogue between the participants.
Information Science & Library Science	This paper studies four different h-index sequences (different in publication periods and/or citation periods). Lotkaian models for these h-index sequences are presented by mutual comparison of one sequence with another one. We also give graphs of these h-sequences for this author on which a discussion is presented. The same is done for the g-index and the R-index.
Management	Numerous technology firms are moving into health, and with their entry they bring innovation in technologies and in business models. The impact of both types of innovation in the health industry is still emerging. To investigate innovation in business models, we held technological innovation relatively constant by drawing data from one technology - the most downloaded apps in iTunes' health and fitness category - and coding the business model dimensions of the firms that developed them. This study examines the differences between incumbents and newcomers in health in four business model dimensions: identifying customers, engaging with customers, monetisation processes, and logistics and governance of the firms. When compared to incumbents, newcomers to health are more often displayed innovation in business model dimensions. Our data suggest that newcomers bring new strategies for customer engagement, customer identity, and monetisation of services, which ultimately lead to altered relationships among actors in health.
Social Issues	Similar to other European higher education systems, the Croatian higher education framework has experienced some remarkable changes since the 1990s as the number of students enrolled increased by more than 80 percent in the last 15 years. Following this expansion, in many countries there has been an increase in non-completion rates, especially during the first year of studies. To gain more insight, this paper presents the theoretical background for examining student non-completion at the first year of studies and identifies the main determinants. A model of student non-completion is developed and adjusted to the Croatian context. Using a rich dataset on eight cohorts of one large Croatian higher education institution, the empirical work analyses the effects of student's personal characteristics, his/her peers, parental qualifications, previous and current schooling characteristics on the probability of non-completion of the first year of studies. This research is also relevant and applicable in other countries experiencing these inefficiencies in student non-completion.
Area Studies	This article analyzes changing patterns of leadership with a special focus on the re-centralization and re-personalization of Chinese politics as initiated under Xi Jinping. Going beyond the categorization of personalistic rule, it argues that the construction of visionary, futuristic governance ideas-as illustrated by the opening of Xiong'an New Area in 2017/2018-are part of a transformational leadership mode. Xiong'an is constructed as a test lab for Chinese AI innovation and a model city unit of green urbanization, illustrating the political leaders' will to engage in all-encompassing reforms. By framing Xiong'an as a presidential signature initiative, potential risks and implications for the party-state's long-term regime legitimacy, in case of unexpected delays or implementation complications, are reduced to a minimum.
Women'S Studies	This article deals with the migration of Bangladeshi village women to the bars of Bombay. For about twelve years (1992 to 2003), ladies' bars provided a lucrative source of income for young women from villages of Jessore and Satkhira. With the money they earned, families were enriched and village economies were invigorated. From being burdens to their families because of the dowry required for their marriage, daughters became assets; wives provided for their husbands, daughters-in-law sustained parents-in-law and sisters established their siblings. No one could deny the widespread benefits of women's migration to Bombay. But how could their activity be reconciled with village norms requiring women to restrain their movements, show modesty and remain under the authority of guardians? How could women's migration be accommodated with village religion and principles of life held to be fundamental to an Islamic way of life and to the good order of society? How could women's earnings be enjoyed without reprobation or disturbances? (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
International Relations	Previous research has shown that successful non-violent resistance (NVR) campaigns promote democracy compared with violent revolutions and top-down liberalization. However, research to date has not examined the character and quality of the democratic regimes following NVR campaigns, or evaluated the mechanisms that produce this effect. In this paper, we address this gap by analyzing the effect of NVR on the quality of democracy, using the Polyarchy index from the Varieties of Democracies project and its sub-components: (1) elected executive; (2) free and fair elections; (3) freedom of expression; (4) associational autonomy; and (5) inclusive citizenship. Using kernel matching and differences-in-differences estimation we find that initiating a democratic transition through NVR improves democratic quality after transition significantly and substantially relative to cases without this characteristic. Our analysis of the Polyarchy index's sub-components reveals that this positive effect comes about primarily owing to improvements in freedom of expression and associational autonomy. This finding speaks to the strength of NVR in promoting expressive dimensions of democracy.
Gerontology	Delirium is a common and serious condition which is often overlooked or misdiagnosed in older people. In 2006, the first set of national clinical practice guidelines for the management of delirium in older people were developed. This paper provides an abbreviated version of the guideline document which includes recommendations for the detection of delirium (diagnosis and screening), assessment and prediction of risk factors for delirium, prevention of delirium and interventions to manage people with delirium. The guidelines reflect the available evidence base and highlight the limited high level research in delirium care, particularly in the areas of symptom management and screening for delirium.
Anthropology	Most scholars agree that avoiding predators is a central concern of lemurs, monkeys, and apes. However, given uncertainties about the frequency with which primates actually become prey, the selective importance of predation in primate evolution continues to be debated. Some argue that primates are often killed by predators, while others maintain that such events are relatively rare. Some authors have contended that predation's influence on primate sociality has been trivial; others counter that predation need not occur often to be a powerful selective force. Given the challenges of documenting events that can be ephemeral and irregular, we are unlikely ever to amass the volume of systematic, comparative data we have on such topics as feeding, social dynamics, or locomotor behavior. Nevertheless, a steady accumulation of field observations, insight gained from natural experiments, and novel taphonomic analyses have enhanced understanding of how primates interact with several predators, especially raptors, the subject of this review.
Communication	When callers to a warm line report on good news tied to a current or ongoing problem, call takers use four different methods to endorse this good news and encourage actions implied within the report. Building upon 93 potentially encouraging responses in 65 actual warm line calls, this study describes four different methods of encouragement used by call takers within news delivery sequences: 1) positive assessments; 2) assessments plus formulations; 3) statements of agreement to a planned action; and 4) second assessments. Across these methods, call takers must do more than what is minimally required as a response in order to encourage and endorse good news.
Area Studies	Chinese feminist activists are actively participating in the Chinese online public sphere. In this study, we examine a case the Anti-Domestic Violence with Nude Photos Campaign and the response of Chinese online censorship to this campaign. Campaign activists used nude photos to mobilize the publics support. According to the existing theoretical perspectives such as the collective action potential theory, this kind of online campaign with pornographic elements and the potential to mobilize people is very likely to be censored. Counter to this expectation, we found that not all of the original photos were removed. Our finding suggests that the interactive manner in which activists responded to the public on SinaWeibos discussion threads matters in terms of the degree of censorship. This study complements the existing studies on the Chinese online censorship system, echoes scholars call for studies on censorship from a more interactive angle, and furthers our understanding of the Chinese feminist movement
Education & Educational Research	Our research explored the experiences of educators who teach in a gender-responsive program for women in a jail. We interrogated how educators fostered empowerment in their classes, what their motivations were for teaching in the program, and the tensions that existed for them when using emancipatory teaching practices in jail. Findings indicate that educators used Freirean concepts to foster empowerment, were motivated to share their knowledge, were motivated to counter dehumanization, and recognized their commonalities and privilege. Trust and agency created tensions while using an emancipatory pedagogy at a jail. Findings have implications for educators teaching marginalized populations.
Environmental Studies	Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification is the most prominent voluntary environmental program for built environments. It has four tiers: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Certified. As of 2015, in the United States, 14% of certified buildings are in the Certified tier, 33% in the Silver tier, 45% in the Gold tier and 8% in the Platinum tier. Why is the Gold tier themost popular although it is neither the least expensive option nor the most environmentally friendly one? To investigate this subject, we conducted interviews with owners of 144 properties across 27 US states and Washington, DC. We find that program design, specifically requirements/points for certifying to a specific tier, influences benefits-costs for certifying to different tiers. Other factors driving tier choice include the region in which the property is located, prior experience of the builder/owner with a particular LEED tier, the availability of subcontractors and the norms for leasing time frames. Finally, the nomenclature of different LEED tiers also shapes the value perception. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	"Objectives. To analyze mortality in Spain and the United States before and after these countries implemented divergent policies in response to the financial crisis of 2008. Methods. We examined mortality statistics in both countries in the years 2000 to 2015. Spain started austerity policies in 2010. We compared differences in mortality ratios, on the basis of trends and effect size analysis. Results. During 2000 to 2010, overall mortality rates (r= 0.98; P<.001; Cohen""s d= -0.228) decreased in both countries. In 2011, this trend changed abruptly in Spain, where observed mortality surpassed expected mortality by 29% in 2011 and by 41% in 2015. By contrast, observed mortality surpassed expected mortality in the United States by only 8% in 2015. As the mortality statistics diverged, the effect size greatly increased (d= 7.531). During this 5-year period, there were 505 559 more deaths in Spain than the expected number, while in the United States the difference was 431 501 more deaths despite the 7-fold larger population in the United States compared with Spain. Conclusions. The marked excess mortality in 2011 to 2015 in Spain is attributable to austerity policies."
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Aims: The aim of the current study was to provide estimates of the distribution of alcohol-related problems in a large sample of college and university students. We also sought to examine trends in the distribution of alcohol-related problems from 2010 to 2018. Methods: Data stem from a recent national health survey from 2018 for higher education in Norway (the SHoT study) in which 50,054 full-time students (69.1% women; 30.9% men) aged 18-35 years participated. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to assess potential alcohol-related problems. Data on demographic characteristics were also collected. Results: More than half of the male students (52.8%) and 4 out of 10 of the female students (40.1%) reported risky, harmful or dependent alcohol use. Compared to women, men had an increased risk of risky alcohol use (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.57), harmful alcohol use (RRR = 2.45) and dependent alcohol use (RRR = 2.73). Younger students had higher rates of risky and harmful alcohol use compared with older students, while rates of dependent alcohol use were similar across the age span. Several demographic variables were associated with alcohol use. The trend analyses revealed that the rates of risky, harmful and dependent alcohol use, as well as mean AUDIT scores, among the students have remained relatively stable over the past 8 years. Conclusions: Alcohol use remains an important health concern among Norwegian college and university students, and the present study confirms the high rates of alcohol-related problems, and the need to address the issue within this population.
Family Studies	This study examined whether work-family support (WF support) buffers permanent and temporary workers similarly against the negative effects of work-family conflict as regard job satisfaction and emotional energy level at work and at home. A total of 1,719 Finnish nurses participated in this study in 2009. The results revealed that high coworker WF support protected temporary workers against the negative effects of high work-family conflict on emotional energy at work. Furthermore, temporary workers with low coworker WF support were at greater risk of job dissatisfaction and diminished emotional energy at home than were their permanent colleagues in the presence of high work-family conflict. Temporary workers may benefit more from coworker WF support if they experience work-family conflict. This should be considered in developing family-friendly practices in organizations where temporary contracts are relatively common.
Cultural Studies	This article considers the legacy of 1970s revolutionary thought and political action within Argentine cultural production. Liliana Heker's 1996 novel El fin de la historia is a fictional depiction of Montonera 'Lucy' Carazo, who was taken as a political prisoner, fell in love with and seduced her captor, and went on to collaborate with the military regime. Similar stories continue to arise and generate a great deal of debate in present-day Argentina, at the same time that Heker's novel itself continues to elicit controversial critical and cultural responses. This close reading of the novel thus situates itself within present-day debates regarding the ethics and politics of 1970s armed struggle as well as ongoing debates concerning individuals who abjure or betray their commitment to 1970s revolutionary causes. The analysis focuses on seduction and sexuality as a means of leading the novel's protagonist astray from the cultural topoi of revolutionary martyrdom and heroism.
Political Science	Do parties represent the ideological preferences of voters in clientelistic political systems? We answer this question by studying the case of Indonesia, whose politics analysts usually describe as being based on patronage. We reassess this proposition using an original survey of over 500 Indonesian legislators. We show that, while party positions are similar on economic policy, they are differentiated on religious issues. To explore the implications of this cleavage, we develop a new measure of policy preferences about state-Islam relations, and match survey responses from legislators and citizens. Our analysis shows a high degree of congruence in party dyads of voters and politicians, which indicates that ideology is more salient than existing research suggests. We further suggest that clientelistic networks may have been pivotal in ensuring the survival of this religious-based ideological cleavage through decades of authoritarianism and democratic politics characterized by ideological moderation.
Law	"Observers have suggested that adding sources of interpretation tends to increase interpreter discretion. The idea is embedded in a quip, attributed to Judge Harold Leventhal, that citing legislative history is like ""looking over a crowd and picking out your friends."" Participants in debates over interpretive method have applied the idea to the proliferation of other sources as well, including canons of construction and originalist history. But the logic of ""more sources, more discretion"" has escaped serious testing. And predicting the effect of source proliferation is not a matter of logic alone. The empirical study of how information loads affect behavior has grown dramatically in recent decades, though almost without notice in legal scholarship on interpretive method. This Article tests the logic and evidence for ""more sources, more discretion."" The idea turns out to be incorrect, without more, as a matter of logic. Adding sources tends to reduce the chance of discretion using a simple model of interpretation. This starter model depicts judges as aggregators of source implications, and it draws on basic probability theory and computer simulations to illustrate. The analysis does change if we allow judges to ""spin"" or ""cherry pick"" sources, but without much hope for limiting discretion by limiting sources. Of course, judges will not always behave like machines executing instructions or otherwise follow the logic of these models. Thus the Article goes on to spotlight provocative empirical studies of information-load effects, develop working theories of interpreter behavior, and present new evidence. After emphasizing that interpreters might ignore additional information at some point, the Article tests three other theories. First, an extended dataset casts doubt on an earlier study that linked a growing stock of precedents to increased judicial discretion. Adding to the pile of precedents seems to have no simple pattern of effect on discretion. Second, existing studies indicate that increasing information loads might prompt judges to promote the status quo, and new data suggest that this effect depends on the type of information added. The number of sources cited in appellant briefs appears to have no effect on judges' willingness to affirm in contrast with the number of words and issues presented, which may have opposing effects. Third, an expanded dataset supports an earlier finding that judges who face a large number of doctrinal factors might weight those factors in a quasi-legal fashion. This time-saving prioritization does not seem to follow conventional ideological lines. With simple intuitions in doubt, thoughtful work remains to be done on the effects of source proliferation. Observers interested in judicial discretion have good reason to look beyond source proliferation to find it. And observers interested in institutional design have good reason to rethink the range of consequences when information is added to our judicial systems."
Education, Special	Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative data set, we examined the extent to which mothers of preschool children with and without the diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) reported stress and depressive symptoms prior to and following diagnosis of ASD. At 4 years, approximately 100 children were parent-identified as diagnosed with ASD. Mothers of children with ASD at 9 months and 4 years had significantly higher incidence of depressive symptoms and stress than mothers of typically developing children. Mothers of children with ASD experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms than mothers of children with disabilities, but the difference was not statistically significant. Using linear regression, a within-group comparison of depressive symptoms of mothers of children with ASD indicated no differences based on child gender, ethnicity, number of children in the family, or partnership status. Implications are presented.
Gerontology	Studies examining fear of falling among older adult men remain limited. The objectives of this study were to compare balance confidence in 2 age cohorts of older clergy and identify predictive determinants of balance confidence in a liturgical research initiative. Participants included 131 community-dwelling Roman Catholic priests age 60-97 yr living in religious communities in 10 mid-Atlantic states. Subjects completed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), timed up-and-go (TUG) test, and 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Younger priests (60-74 yr) demonstrated a significantly higher ABC score than the older cohort (75 and above yr) of priests (89.1 +/- 12.6 vs.78.4 +/- 13.9, p =.001). Confidence was significantly correlated with BBS (rho = <.01), TUG (r =-.58, p < .01), and GDS (r =similar to.39, p < .01) scores. A stepwise-regression model demonstrated that balance ability, mood, assistive-device use, and physical activity predicted 52% of the variance in balance confidence.
Management	In this paper we focus on the early stages of projects and their governance implications by investigating the introduction of nuclear power in Finland. We look at the early stages through the lens of path dependence and illustrate how early decisions may lead the project down the wrong path. However, we also develop a path creation perspective in order to develop an understanding of how the project actors in our case deliberately navigated in the cold war atmosphere to avoid a budding lock-in. This historical study highlights the importance of building relationships between key actors and securing their commitment during the early stages of a project. We argue that strong relationships and commitment open up opportunities for creating alternative paths during project appraisal, increase the array of available governance mechanisms, and hence lay the foundations for the final governance structure of the project execution phase.

Social Sciences, Biomedical	Expanding access to pharmaceuticals has become one of the most visible aspects of twenty-first century global health practices, as evidenced by the moral urgency of antiretroviral rollout and the pressing call for new drugs for neglected diseases. However, the role of prescription drugs in public health was far less obvious to the framers of international health organizations only a half-century ago. This article examines the evolving role of pharmaceuticals in global health practices by charting the emergence of the category of 'essential medicines': initially a list of 186 drugs first defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1977 to be 'basic, indispensable, and necessary for the health of the population', and subsequently expanded by actors beyond the WHO including NGOs, pharmaceutical companies and the broader financial community. This apparently simple act of list-making worked to transport a set of commodities from the private, commercial sphere into a public health commons, and sparked a series of methodological, logistical and political controversies over the winnowing of 'essential' from 'inessential' that collapsed evidentiary, regulatory, participatory and market terms into a single process. To ask 'what practices render a medicine essential?' is therefore to address the shifting ecology of knowledge governing global health today. BioSocieties (2011) 6, 10-33. doi:10.1057/biosoc.2010.39
Law	"When a plaintiff files a transnational suit in the United States, the defendant will often file a forum non conveniens motion to dismiss the suit in favor of a court in a foreign country, arguing, as the forum non conveniens doctrine requires, that the foreign country provides an adequate alternative forum that is more appropriate than a U.S. court for hearing the suit. Some defendants, however, experience ""forum shopper's remorse"": Having obtained what they wished for-a dismissal in favor of a foreign legal system with a supposedly more pro-defendant environment than the United States-they encounter unexpectedly pro-plaintiff outcomes, including substantial judgments against them. When this happens, a defendant may argue that the foreign judiciary suffers from deficiencies that should preclude enforcement of the judgment-an argument seemingly at odds with the defendant's earlier forum non conveniens argument that the same foreign judiciary was adequate and more appropriate. This Article shows that under current doctrine, these seemingly inconsistent arguments are not necessarily inconsistent at all. The forum non conveniens doctrine's foreign judicial adequacy standard is lenient, plaintiff focused and ex ante, but the judgment enforcement doctrine's standard is relatively strict, defendant-focused, and ex post. Therefore, the same foreign judiciary may be adequate for a forum non conveniens dismissal, but inadequate for purposes of enforcing an ensuing foreign judgment. However, these different standards can create a transnational access-to-justice gap: A plaintiff may be denied both court access in the United States and a remedy based on the foreign court's judgment. This Article argues that this gap should be closed, and it proposes doctrinal changes to accomplish this."
Environmental Studies	The importance of local participation in biodiversity governance was recently recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) through the incorporation of Indigenous Peoples' and Local Community Conserved Territories and Areas (ICCAs) as a protected area category. This paper explores what barriers ICCAs might face in their successful implementation within already existing protected area systems. I look at this issue in the context of the decentralisation of biodiversity governance in Costa Rica and examine the internal makeup of four different conservation areas within the National System of Conservation Areas. My findings suggest that it is not enough to enact legal reforms allowing and encouraging local participation. Successfully involving local participation requires attention to the class-based relationships within the protected area bureaucracy that create incentives (or not) to link with the local rural citizenry affected by these areas. In three out of four conservation areas, the dominant social class and urban-rural dynamics combined with a lack of accountability mechanisms have discouraged any real rural involvement and empowerment for decision-making. The strategy of the one area that succeeded at sorting these obstacles to incorporate local participation is described in detail.
Criminology & Penology	Research Summary In 2012, the editors of CPP published an exchange about the Drug Market Intervention (DMI) in High Point, NC, concluding that it may be a promising approach to crime control but questioning whether it could be implemented across different settings. In this effectiveness study, we followed a cohort of seven sites that participated in a Bureau of Justice Assistance-sponsored DMI training to assess implementation and outcomes. Three sites were not able to implement, and implementation fidelity varied across the four sites that did implement. Of the four sites that held at least one call-in, only one was successful at reducing overall and drug crime (by 28% and 56%, respectively). This works out to an implementation rate of 57% with an average overall crime reduction of 16% (treatment-on-the-treated) or 4% (intent-to-treat). The results of this study demonstrate the importance of replication and the careful study of implementation fidelity prior to wide dissemination. Policy ImplicationsWhen the findings of an evaluation reveal an effective crime reduction program, particularly when it garners significant public attention, it is not uncommon to rush to judgment that it should be widely implemented. DMI is a perfect illustration of this shortsighted approach to evidence-based crime preventionmultiple trials across a variety of contexts are necessary to understand whether a program is ready for broad dissemination and scale-up. The DMI program was challenging for sites to implement and resulted in significant reductions in crime in the site with the implementation fidelity that was highest and most similar to the original site. Our findings echo earlier concerns that the approach may be less effective across diverse settings and illustrate why effectiveness studies are vital in the development of evidence-based policy.
International Relations	Can the United States' extended deterrence guarantee the security of South Korea against nuclear threats posed by North Korea? North Korea manipulates its nuclear capability not only as a means of deterrence but also as a military leverage to threaten the very existence of South Korea. Considering the current pattern of North Korea's behavior and the geopolitical and strategic implications for the Korean peninsula, the U.S. promise of extended deterrence for South Korea appears to have many limitations. In fact, as demonstrated in the sinking of the ROK naval frigate Cheonan incident, North Korea, with its nuclear capability intact, now threatens South Korean security more openly. Accordingly, measures to increase the credibility of America's extended deterrence become ever more imperative such that it will act as a stronger deterrence against further aggressive actions by North Korea and give greater assurance to South Koreans. The U.S. extended deterrence statement in its Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) is not really adequate, being rather general in its tone and content. This article analyzes this credibility issue pertaining to the U.S. extended deterrence, along with the North Korean nuclear threats and their security implications, and finally proposes a series of measures and policy implications to enhance the ROK-U.S. security mechanism.
Environmental Studies	Dramatic changes in ecosystem services have motivated recent work characterizing their interactions, including identifying trade-offs and synergies. Although time is arguably implicit in these ideas of trade-offs and synergies (e.g., temporal dynamics or changes in ecosystem services), such interactions are routinely inferred based on the spatial relationships among ecosystem services alone (e.g., spatial concordance of ecosystem services indicates synergies, whereas incongruence signifies trade-offs). The limitations of this approach have not been fully explored. We quantified ecosystem service interactions using correlations among contemporary ecosystem services and compared these results to those derived by incorporating change in ecosystem services from an earlier decade. To document change over similar to 60 years in an urbanizing floodplain, we used aerial photography to map multiple floodplain-associated ecosystem services. Our results demonstrate how incorporating landscape baselines can influence measured synergies and trade-offs. Spatial correlations among contemporary ecosystem services missed several interactions that were detected when using prior baseline ecosystem services. Ignoring the history of ecosystem services and their change over time may result in missed opportunities to foster their synergies and lead to unnecessary trade-offs. Efforts to incorporate ecosystem services into land management should include long-term monitoring and baseline reconstructions of ecosystem services.
Education & Educational Research	"This paper draws on findings of comparative international research on students"" poetic writing about the natural environment in the context of the classroom and a naturalistic setting. The study involved 97, nine- to 10-year-olds in four classes: two classes were in an English primary school with their counterparts in a Western Australian primary school. One class in each school had vicarious contact with nature as a stimulus for writing, using a previously taught technique for writing poetry; the other class in each school used the same technique but had direct contact with nature. The study has implications for students"" literacy development, creativity and agency and suggests that students"" poetic writing is enhanced through direct contact with nature. Teachers in both England and Australia, countries where high stakes"" testing dominates the literacy curriculum, may find that standards of writing improve when students are given direct contact with natural spaces and are scaffolded to elicit their poetic voice."
Area Studies	This study explores the effects of changes in electoral systems on political marketing, and, more particularly, the impact of the shift from the parliamentary electoral system which has been in operation in Israel since 1948, to the presidentary (combined of elements from the parliamentary system, and the presidential system) on the two largest Israeli parties' marketing strategies. Out of 670 political broadcasts by Likud and Labour, 207 were examined for five out of the six electoral campaigns that took place since 1988: the 1988 and 1992 campaigns, before the switch to the presidentary system, the 1996 and 1999 campaigns after the establishment of the combined system and the 2003 campaign, after Israel changed back to the parliamentary electoral system. The findings supported the study's main arguments regarding the extent and direction of the impact of the change in the electoral system on the developments in political marketing. Beginning in 1996, there was a decrease in broadcasts presenting political issues and a sharp increase in broadcasts that focus on personality alone. Equivalently, the percentage of broadcasts addressing the centre of the political map, rather than distinct publics, grew significantly. In 2003, with the return to the parliamentary system, the marketing strategy of the two parties, and more particularly of the Labour Party, changed back to the pre-1992 pattern: a large percentage of the broadcasts focused on issues and not on the candidates' personalities, and addressed distinct target audiences rather than the centre.
Business, Finance	Procyclicality in banking may result in financial instability and therefore be destructive to economic growth. The sensitivity of different banking balance sheet and income statement variables to the business cycle is diversified and may be prone to increasing integration of financial markets. In this paper, we address the problem of the influence of financial integration on the transmission of economic shocks from one country to another and consequently on the sensitivity of loan loss provisions (LLPs) to the business cycle. The application of the seemingly unrelated regression equations (SURE) approach to 13 OECD countries in 1995-2009 shows that the procyclicality of LLPs is statistically significant almost in the whole sample of countries. Regardless of the econometric specification, the income-smoothing, capital management and risk management hypotheses are hardly supported by the data. However, in SURE specification, the relationship of bank-specific variables is of higher statistical significance than in the country regression approach. Hence, cross-country interconnectedness is not only economically, but also empirically important when analyzing cross-country diversifications of LLPs.
Public Administration	This study attempts to explore mobbing victims' aggressive responses and to determine how these aggressive responses differentiate based on individual and working life differences. A survey instrument related to aggressive responses to the mobbing and demographics was administered on 291 public and private sector employees, who reported to be subjected to mobbing. As a result of the analysis on the data obtained from the survey instrument, it was found that nearly 88 % of employees could resort to four types of aggressive responses described as insidious, offended, explicit, and imputed to organization. It was concluded that employees exhibit offended responses when subjected to mobbing against possibilities to maintain their personal reputation, exhibit explicit responses when subjected to mobbing against physical health, exhibit the responses imputed to organization when subjected to mobbing against possibilities to maintain their social contacts and exhibit insidious responses when subjected to any of these mobbing types excluding mobbing against possibilities to maintain their personal reputation.
Public Administration	Climate change scientists argue that there is a link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. The catastrophic consequences of these natural disasters on human life, agriculture and infrastructure calls into question the role and responsibility of governments in managing such events. Mixed messages are being communicated by governments to the public from one extreme advocating the provision of as much assistance as required to rebuild communities following an extreme weather event, to policies being developed encouraging communities to become more resilient. Seemingly, there is no contradiction in following both approaches, however, it is currently not clear the extent of responsibility and accountability for protecting its citizens versus the onus on the community to defend itself from natural disasters. This paper explores these themes from the perspective of local government in relation to the devastating floods that hit Victoria, Australia in 2010/11.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Due to the growing significance of international studies, the need for tools to assess the equivalence of items in international surveys is pressing. Web probing is a powerful tool for identifying the causes of nonequivalence; it incorporates probing techniques from cognitive interviewing into cross-national web surveys. So far, our web probing approach has applied three different probe types - category-selection probes, specific probes, and comprehension probes - to inquire about different aspects of an item. Previous research has mostly asked one probe type per item, but in some situations it might be preferable to assess potentially troublesome items with multiple probe types. However, empirical evidence is missing on whether the sequence of probe types has an impact on response quality, respondents' motivation, and answer content. In this study, we report evidence from a web experiment that was conducted with 1,354 respondents from Germany, Great Britain, the U.S., Spain, and Mexico in June 2014. In this experiment, we asked respondents three different probes for one item, and we manipulated the sequence of probes in each experimental condition. Our research indicates that the sequence in which different probe types are asked has an impact on response quality, the respondents' motivation, and probe answer content. However, the respondents in the five countries reacted differently to the variation in the probe sequence, suggesting that response behavior to probes is partly culturally driven.
Geography	Aggregate measures that capture multiple aspects of socio-ecological vulnerability in a single or small number of vulnerability indices can produce vulnerability maps that act as powerful visual tools to identify those areas most susceptible to future environmental changes. Such indices are easily communicable and offer valuable guidance to policymakers and investors, providing insights as to where more targeted research or policy interventions can address current challenges and reduce future risks. However, such aggregation inevitably reduces the richness of information provided by the suites of individual vulnerability indicators on which the maps are based. This trade-off between information richness and information communicability is a challenge in the quantification and communication of complex phenomena such as socio-ecological vulnerability. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques as a means of creating information-rich spatially-explicit aggregate indices of socio-ecological vulnerability. We present a 'proof of concept' analysis of socio-ecological vulnerability for the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region using both PCA and traditional normalization based techniques for generating spatially explicit, aggregated socio-ecological vulnerability indices. The vulnerability indices are based on published biophysical and socio-economic data and mapped at a 10 arc minute resolution. The resulting PCA based vulnerability maps indicate the regional spatial variability of four statistically independent, unique components of socio-ecological vulnerability, providing more information than the single index produced using a normalization/summation approach. Such uncorrelated, information-rich vulnerability indices represent a potentially useful policy tool for identifying areas of greatest concern in terms of both the relative level, and the underlying causes and impacts of, socio-ecological vulnerability to environmental changes across broad spatial scales.

Geography	In the last decades land-covers in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region have experienced a great transformation that has changed landscape structure and functioning. Agrarian area has decreased, forests have increased and urban area has sprawled. In this work we analyze the process of urban sprawl in wildland-urban interface areas and the perception of some inhabitants of the transformation of rural the landscape. We chose a suburban township of the BMR, to study locally several global environmental problems. By means of an integrative methodology we quantified and interpreted land-cover changes for the period 1956-2008.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The study aimed to ascertain the relation between children's participation in daily activities, engaging with family and friends and their subjective well-being (SWB); and to ascertain the extent to which the nature of the relation differs across three age groups (8, 10 and 12), gender, and geographical context (urban and rural). The study used data from Wave 2 of the South African Children's Worlds Study conducted with a random sample of 3284 children between the ages of 8 to 12-years. Three scales measuring children's daily activities, engagement with family and friends, and their SWB using the Students' Life Satisfaction Scale were used. Data were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling; with group comparisons assessed by means of multi-group structural equation modelling. The study found a significant relation between children's engagement with family and friends and participation in daily activities and their SWB; with the combined influence of engagement with family and friends and participation in daily activities explaining 31% of the variance in SWB. Engagement with family and friends contributed a higher explained variance in SWB than participation in daily activities. Multi-group analysis revealed the tenability of metric invariance across age and gender, which allowed for meaningful comparisons by correlation and regression coefficients. Across geographical contexts scalar invariance was tenable allowing for meaningful comparisons across correlations, regression coefficients, and latent means. While the findings of the study suggest that children's time use is an important factor influencing their SWB, researchers, practitioners and policy makers should consider the diversity of 'childhoods' in South Africa, especially as it relates to the historical 'situatedness' of the macro-factors of poverty, deprivation, and social inequality, and how this impacts children's access to and the nature of their daily activities.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article explores the developing relationship between neuroscientific under-standings of 'addiction' and 'youth'. Drawing on science and technology studies theory and social scientific analyses of both these concepts, it identifies a co-constitutive relationship between notions of addiction as a brain disease and of youth as a stage of brain development. These two concepts are then tracked in a series of drug education documents concerned with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and addiction among young people, and their implications and effects and analysed together. The aim is to investigate the impact on drug education of neuroscientific approaches to youth and addiction. Are new concepts and directions for harm reduction created in the encounters between neuroscience, youth and addiction, or do they simply reinstate and reinforce existing assumptions and judgments? Is drug education shaped by these concepts likely to achieve its aim, that is, to increase young people's sensitivity to harm and safety? The article begins by introducing neuroscientific accounts of youth and addiction, arguing that the two concepts share three key assumptions. First, both emphasise biology and sideline social context in the making of drug use practices and outcomes. Second, both reproduce uncritical treatments of brain scans (PET and fMRI images) as windows into minds and subjects. Third, both understand the brain as ontologically separate from its environment. These assumptions and their implications are then tracked through an analysis of Australian drug education resources, focusing on how drug education constitutes youthfulness and addiction as pathological disorders. In its reliance on neuroscientific understandings of youth and addiction, we conclude, drug education is unlikely to achieve its goal of reducing drug-related harm.
Public Administration	Thus far, there has not been any investigation into the populist held beliefs and attitudes among public servants. These attitudes, given the considerable discretionary decision power of public servants, and their influence in policy-making processes, could have a significant impact on public policies. This paper investigates the populist attitudes of public servants, based on data that are retrieved from the European Social Survey. The paper compares public servants from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The results show that public servants hold surprisingly similar populist views as compared with non-public servants, and that there are striking differences between countries. There are significant implications for the work public servants do, and the representativeness of the administration.
Linguistics	"The study discussed in this article is based on a sample of 10 extensive interviews conducted with two generations of Puerto Rican and Dominican immigrants, looking more specifically at the realization of two variables described in Labov et al.'s Atlas, namely, /ae/ (also called ""short /a/"", or ""the vowel of BAT/BAD"") and /<^>/ (also called ""long open /o/"", or ""the vowel of BOUGHT""). Our results suggests that these immigrants do raise long open /o/, however they do not consistently follow the short /ae/ split, but rather the general nasal pattern. We discuss possible explanations for this asymmetry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Women'S Studies	In this article I analyse how socioeconomic constraints structure the geographical mobility of Latvian migrant women working on the island of Guernsey. A shifting notion of gendered care is revealed through a time-geographic investigation of distant emplacements of workplace and home, and through the neoliberal-informed evaluations by the mothers themselves. Their justifications emphasise the belief that care from a distance should be prioritised over physical proximity to those in need of care. With examples from interviews with mothers who have provided care during their movements between Latvia and Guernsey, I demonstrate how the outcomes of shifting notions of gendered care are placed within a wider context of the gender regime in a transforming Latvia. A specific version of a neoliberal mother, shaped by gender regimes in post-socialist Latvia and a demand for female labour in Western Europe, emerges among women with care responsibilities.

Management	This study examined the impact of human resource (HR) capabilities on internal customer satisfaction and organisational effectiveness. It drew on data from HR managers and line managers; a total of 238 valid matches was obtained. Structural equation modelling was employed to examine the proposed model. The results showed that some HR capabilities appear to be linked to internal customer satisfaction and organisational effectiveness. The implications for practitioners were to modify and emphasise certain HR practices, and to emphasise the role of internal customers for organisational effectiveness enhancement. These findings revealed the importance of internal customers in enhancing employee morale, organisational commitment, employee productivity, turnover rate and the organisation's ability to attract talent.
Anthropology	This article presents Mapuche education knowledge that forms part of a family's education. The aim is to contribute to the epistemic debate on the indigenous educational content of intercultural education for the purpose of overcoming ignorance of this content in schools located within contemporary Mapuche life. Ignorance of the Mapuche's educational knowledge hinders the implementation of an educational approach best suited to the sociocultural knowledge, for both Mapuche and non-Mapuche students. In fact, the schooling of both Mapuche and non-Mapuche children has been based almost exclusively on the monocultural curriculum of Western society. The methodology is based on educational research from a qualitative perspective through interviews with a sample of 16 kimches (sages). The results reveal categories of knowledge linked to concepts of time and space in the annual cycle, concepts of geographical-territorial origin (tuwun), and parental descent (kupan). The Mapuche family incorporates each of these aspects into the education of children and adolescents. It is concluded that this knowledge may constitute an epistemic contribution that favors a contextualized education and strengthens the education of students through the dialogue of knowledge systems from an intercultural approach.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	"Food and physical activity access and availability in two contrasting cities in Alabama were investigated. An in-outlet, observational, cross-sectional design was utilized to assess the opportunities for healthy food choices and physical activity. Thirty retail food outlets and 29 physical activity outlets were inventoried. None of the convenience stores carried frozen, low-sodium or dark-green, yellow vegetables, low-fat milk or yogurt, low-sodium and low-fat cheese, while none of the supermarkets in Tuskegee stocked low-sodium vegetables. In Tuskegee, the single public recreational area, which offered activities such as basketball, fees ranged from $25 to $35/month. Tuskegee has a shortage of ""chain"" supermarkets and a dominance of convenience stores which stocked few healthy foods. Overall, there are limited opportunities for healthy food and physical activity choices, which could be a barrier for chronic disease prevention efforts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Ethnic Studies	The term migration background is commonly used in Germany today, but this neologism is only 20 years old. As an official category, it is even much younger. There has been only little research concerning the new population category, which emerged around the turn of the millennium. Thus, the question how the migration background could become the central category describing migration related diversity in Germany is not answered yet. This article fills this gap by exploring the context of the emergence of the migration background including the history of ethnic categories in German official statistics. It describes the actual definition of a migration background which became an official category in 2007 when the German Federal Statistical Office started publishing data regarding the population with a migration background based on the microcensus, a 1% household survey with mandatory participation. The central questions are: how national membership is imagined, how is it inscribed in definitions, and what adaptions had to be made over time? To answer these questions, different sources as questionnaires, publications of results of the microcensus and national reports on children and youth are analysed. Using interpretative methods, it is shown how a new taxonomy of the population in Germany was created, how it was influenced by international and national educational research, and to which extent it reshaped the perspectives on newcomers and natives. It is shown that the new category is tightly bound to citizenship and summarizes a number of older ethnic categories, but excludes also immigrated Germans who immigrated shortly after Second World War and from the former German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the label migration background is misleading because inherited citizenship and ancestry is in the centre of the definition rather than migration experience.
Education & Educational Research	This paper explores the dropout experience of children who dropped out of schools located in two rural communities' in the Central Region of Ghana. The main research question sought to explore the meaning and types of drop out founded on the views of children who had dropped out of school. The study tracked 18 children aged 7-17 years. Snowball sampling was employed to identify participants of the study. Data was collected from children and significant others(2) using in-depth interviews. Using CREATE's analytical framework of zones of exclusion, this paper identify five type of school dropouts and argues that policies to prevent dropout and encourage drop-in requires specific rather than general targeting.

Law	Over a decade has passed since landmark Delaware corporate law decisions on oversight responsibility, and only a small handful of cases have survived a motion to dismiss. Scholars have puzzled over what it means to have the potential for corporate accountability lodged within the duty of good faith, but almost never brought to fruition in terms of trial liability. This Article explores the public-regarding purpose of the obedience and oversight duties in corporate law and provides a descriptive account of how they are applied in practice. The Article argues that the fidelity to external law required by the duty of good faith largely serves a legitimizing role for corporate law. Expressing obligations of legal compliance and oversight within corporate law acknowledges societal interests in the rule of law and preserves the ability of courts to flexibly respond to particularly salient and egregious violations of public trust, should they arise, without upending case law developed over decades. Further, this Article examines the body of Delaware law concerning the oversight and obedience aspects of the duty of good faith and argues that they have become functionally linked. In practice to date, Delaware courts have prioritized giving directors broad latitude to take business risk by drawing a line at legal risk, despite the possibility that both types of activity could create social value or harm depending on the circumstances. Under current Delaware case law, courts have allowed Caremark claims to proceed where evidence exists to infer that the board utterly failed to implement a compliance monitoring system or that the directors engaged in disobedience by consciously flouting, violating, or ignoring the law. Bringing together these threads of discussion, this Article concludes that corporate law's public-regarding commitment to the rule of law supports accountability in these instances of disobedience as well as more broadly when fiduciaries act with willful ignorance or an awareness that their efforts at compliance are insufficient.
Urban Studies	The existing urban politics literature is insufficient in explaining why redistributional policymaking flourishes in some contexts and not in others. This article attempts to move beyond the structure versus agency dichotomy and uses a close comparison of the living wage movements in Chicago and San Francisco, not only to argue that history matters, but to illustrate how historical narratives are actively (re)constructed by social actors to further their agenda(s). Although each city started with similar campaigns to enact basic contractor-only forms of living wage laws, by the end of a 10-year period the resulting level of change in San Francisco stood in stark contrast to Chicago, where advocates failed to extend the living wage to big box retailers. Using a brief history of economic restructuring and an empirical assessment of the business climate valence of each city's political regime, this article finds that economic and political factors jointly structure the depth and pace of policy change by setting the terms of debate within redistributional policy discourses. This joint determination occurs because problem frames are path-dependent and because inherited political structures, such as the availability of binding referendum, allocate agenda-setting power and opportunities to challenge entrenched interests.
Urban Studies	Nowadays, the favela makes up part of the urban imagery of Rio de Janeiro, but it has not always characterized the city. It is the product of a whole set of transformations the city experienced during the last century, and which include political, geographic, economic, and social aspects. After presenting the geography, history and symbolism inherent in this city, the article briefly describes these transformations. The main objective is to develop an initial analysis of the setting for the Brazilian novels Ciudad de Dios and Infierno. Finally, the article attempts to sketch the role that the authors play in the logic of social exclusion. Exclusion, the main consequence -and simultaneously the main cause- of the favela, is addressed from the systems theory point of view, since it conceives society as a system that describes itself by its functionally differentiated character.
History Of Social Sciences	In an article in this journal, Nicholas Pastore rejected Ludwig Wittgenstein's critique of Wolfgang Kohler and Gestalt psychology. Pastore appears not to have appreciated Wittgenstein's argument that Kohler mistook conceptual questions for factual ones. A similar confusion seems to underlie at least some aspects of contemporary neuroscience. Be that as it may, Wittgenstein has had minimal influence on the research practices of psychologists while Kohler remains influential. This outcome would not have surprised Wittgenstein, who predicted that scientists would not see his work as relevant to theirs. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Law	"Corporate charter competition has become an increasingly international phenomenon. The thesis of this Article is that this development in corporate law requires a greater focus on corporate tax law. We first demonstrate how a tax system's capacity to distort the international charter market depends both upon its approach to determining corporate location and upon the extent to which it taxes foreign source corporate profits. We also show, however, that it is not possible to remove all distortions through modifications to the tax system alone. We present instead two alternative methods for preserving an international charter market. The first-best solution involves severing the markets for corporate law and corporate tax law through coordination of locational rules under each regime, with a ""place of incorporation"" rule for corporate law and a ""real seat"" rule for corporate tax. The second-best solution relies on a properly designed federal structure. The crucial design elements for such a federal system are the allocation of substantive law between the federal and subfederal levels, corporate and corporate tax locational rules, and the taxation of corporate migration and foreign source corporate profits. With due attention to these details, an international charter market can avoid the potentially distorting effects of corporate taxation. In the final part of the Article we apply our analysis to the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Israel, and show how difficult it is, in the real world, to separate corporate charter and corporate tax competition."
Anthropology	"What happens when trauma becomes a political frame for recognizing anti-black racism and police violence? I grapple with this question by illustrating the ways that survivors of police torture must present themselves as a part of a disability category. More broadly, this article demonstrates that, as opposed to being a category of difference unto itself, the idea of police torture in Chicago has been transformed through legal precedent, activism, and the resulting legislation to emerge, as it has in its latest rendition, as a medical condition. I argue that the role of trauma in producing such categories of disability is not unidirectional. Since racialized debilitation always already informs societal institutions before any contemporary incidence of state violence occurs, these concessions reify a ""racial caste system"" by putting the onus on the traumatized to gain state recognition. If they do not, then they have no one to blame but themselves. In sum, I show that the problem with trauma as a legal category is that it justifies inequality for black victims of police violence because these concessions betray a tacit assumption that they are debilitated by virtue of their racialized status before they can gain relief through the law."
Demography	In this article, we use newly available data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study to compare a wide range of attitudes related to pregnancy for 961 black and white young women. We also investigate the extent to which race differences are mediated by, or net of, family background, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), adolescent experiences related to pregnancy, and current SES. Compared with white women, black women generally have less positive attitudes toward young nonmarital sex, contraception, and childbearing, and have less desire for sex in the upcoming year. This is largely because black women are more religious than white women and partly because they are more socioeconomically disadvantaged in young adulthood. However, in spite of these less positive attitudes, black women are more likely to expect sex without contraception in the next year and to expect more positive consequences if they were to become pregnant, relative to white women. This is largely because, relative to white women, black women had higher rates of sex without contraception in adolescence and partly because they are more likely to have grown up with a single parent. It is unclear whether attitudes toward contraception and pregnancy preceded or are a consequence of adolescent sex without contraception. Some race differences remain unexplained; net of all potential mediators in our models, black women have less desire for sex in the upcoming year, but they are less willing to refuse to have sex with a partner if they think it would make him angry and they expect more positive personal consequences of a pregnancy, relative to white women. In spite of these differences, black women's desires to achieve and to prevent pregnancy are very similar to white women's desires.
Development Studies	This paper explores the range of functions undertaken by the University of Fort Hare (UFH) over its 100-year history and in what ways it has carried these out. Drawing on the framework developed by Castells on the functions performed by universities, the paper shows that UFH's role in three of these functions - namely, in the production of values for individuals and social legitimation for the state, in the formation of the dominant elite, and in the training of the labour force - has shifted and changed along with the different imperatives and conditions of the colonial, apartheid and post-1994 democratic eras in South Africa. By contrast, UFH's role in the production of scientific knowledge is a relatively recent development, but one which has strengthened rapidly.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Several outbreaks of varicella have occurred among refugees. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of varicella susceptibility among refugees, and identify risk factors for varicella susceptibility. All refugees rostered at Crossroads Clinic in Toronto, Canada in 2011-2014 were included in our study. Varicella serology was assessed at the initial visit. Refugees' age, sex, education, time since arrival, and climate and population density of birth country were abstracted from the chart. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for varicella susceptibility. 1063 refugees were rostered at Crossroads Clinic during the study; 7.9 % (95 % CI 6.1, 9.7) were susceptible to varicella. Tropical climate (OR 3.20, 95 % CI 1.53, 6.69) and younger age (ORper year of age 0.92, 95 % CI 0.88-0.96) were associated with increased varicella susceptibility. These risk factors for varicella susceptibility should be taken into account to maximize the cost-effectiveness of varicella prevention strategies among refugees.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Background Following the rapid economic growth, there has been a strong disparity of regional development and personal income in China. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be influenced by socioeconomic status at both the societal and individual levels. This study examines the associations of regional economic development, household income and gender on T2DM. Method Data from the baseline of a Chinese population-based study of approximately 500 000 adults from 10 areas were analysed. Clinically identified and screen-detected T2DM were examined. Regional economic development was indicated by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. A logistic regression-based method was used to calculate the adjusted prevalence. Result The prevalence of T2DM was significantly higher in medium GDP per capita areas for both males (7.04%, 95% CI 6.82% to 7.26%) and females (6.04%, 95% CI 5.86% to 6.22%) compared with areas of other levels of economic development. The different shapes of associations between household income and T2DM prevalence were observed in different GDP per capita areas. There were strong gender differences in terms of both the trend and strength of association between household income and T2DM prevalence. Conclusions Findings from this study underscore the importance of economic conditions and gender difference on T2DM. It suggests that strategies for diabetes prevention should address social-economic differences besides a person-centred approach.
History & Philosophy Of Science	A 'multiple-proposition (MP) phenomenon' is a putative counterexample to the widespread implicit assumption that a simple indicative sentence (relative to a context of utterance) semantically expresses at most one proposition. Several philosophers and linguists (including Stephen Neale and Chris Potts) have recently developed hypotheses concerning this notion. The guiding questions motivating this research are: (1) Is there an interesting and homogenous semantic category of MP phenomena? (2) If so, what is the import? Do MP theories have any relevance to important current questions in the study of language? I motivate an affirmative answer to (1), and then argue that MP theorizing is quite relevant to debates at the semantics/pragmatics interface.
Business, Finance	PRESIDENT ARMANDO EMILIO GUEBUZA IS A MAN ON A MISSION
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objective: Among working-age Australian adults with a disability, we assess the association between disability-based discrimination and both overall health and psychological distress. Methods: Using data from the 2015 Australian Bureau of Statistics Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers we estimated the proportion of working-age women and men (15-64 years) with disability who report disability-based discrimination by socio-demographic characteristics and assessed the association between disability-based discrimination and self-reported health and psychological distress. Results: Nearly 14% of Australians with disability reported disability-based discrimination in the previous year. Disability-based discrimination was more common among people living in more disadvantaged circumstances (unemployed, low income, lower-status occupations), younger people and people born in English-speaking countries. Disability-based discrimination was associated with higher levels of psychological distress (OR: 2.53, 95%CI: 2.11, 3.02) and poorer self-reported health (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.37, 1.95). Conclusion: Disability-based discrimination is a prevalent, important determinant of health for Australians with disability. Implications for public health: Disability-based discrimination is an under-recognised public health problem that is likely to contribute to disability-based health inequities. Public health policy, research and practice needs to concentrate efforts on developing policy and programs that reduce discrimination experienced by Australians with disability.
Anthropology	In this paper we show that a site Konczyce Wielkie 4 (SW Poland) published in JAS (2010a) by Foltyn et al. can no longer be accepted as a reliable evidence for the oldest presence of humans in the northern part of Carpathians and Sudetes Mountains (Matuyama-Brunhes). Unfortunately, in the light of conducted analysis among others with Peacock's method, it seems that the lithics from Konczyce Wielkie appear to be much more similar to geofacts rather than to artefacts. As a background for comparison Lower Paleolithic artefacts from two German sites Wallendorf and Wangen were used. Moreover, the petrological determination of the finds from Konczyce Wielkie is also dubious issue. Foltyn et al. suggested a long distance transport of lithics from several sources. As it has been demonstrated in the paper, local glacial sediments consist of rocks that are analogous to published lithic spectrum. Finally, the geological data shown by Foltyn et al. seem to be incorrect. Authors did not take into account the results concerning the regional geology that indicate clearly much younger age of layers dated by Foltyn et al. (2010a) at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Cultural Studies	It is often assumed that resistance is the global practice of youth culture and that every local youth culture has its own, idiosyncratic mode of contestation'. However, contemporary Chinese youth are generally considered less rebellious than their Western counterparts. Investigating the way Chinese youth culture shapes itself, this article examines four questions: Is there such a thing as Chinese youth culture? What is the status quo of Chinese youth? What do they resist? Are their acts of resistance successful? Employing examples of acts of resistance that emerged during the production of the Super Girl Voice contest, a popular Chinese reality show, this article demonstrates the strategic resistance of the nexus of the consumerist media industry and the dominant revolutionary ideology in contemporary China. It is found that acts of resistance in this space demonstrate the desire of Chinese youth to exhibit themselves as talented individuals and achieve higher social status, and that these acts contribute to self-expression in the developing civil society.
Political Science	That citizens engage in retrospective voting is widely established in the literature. But to what extent is retrospection affected by the expectations that leaders set in advance? We develop a theoretical framework of how expectation setting affects voters' retrospective evaluations of incumbent performance. To test the theory, we conduct a series of between-subjects experiments in which we independently manipulate both expectation setting and the eventual outcome. In domains where politicians have practical authority, or direct influence over outcomes, setting high expectations incurs a cost in public support if the projected outcome is not attained. The same is true in domains where politicians have theoretical authority, or limited influence, but where expectation setting sends a signal about the leader's judgment. However, in domains where politicians have neither practical nor theoretical authority, setting high expectations is unambiguously beneficial, implying that optimism is valued by voters as a personality disposition.
Development Studies	The paper verifies the Azzimonti et al. (2014) conclusions on a sample of 53 African countries for the period 1996-2008. Authors of the underlying study have established theoretical underpinnings for a negative nexus between rising public debt and inequality in OECD nations. We assess the effects of four debt dynamics on Inequality Adjusted Human Development. Instrumental variable and interactive regressions were employed as empirical strategies. Two main findings were established which depend on whether debt is endogenous to or interactive with globalization. First, when external debt is endogenous to globalization, the effect on inclusive human development is negative, whereas when it is interactive with globalization, the effect is positive. This may reflect the false economics of preconditions. The magnitudes of negative estimates from endogenous related effects were higher than the positive marginal interactive effects. Policy implications were discussed in light of the post-2015 development agenda.
Ethics	While states have agreed to substantial reduction of emissions in the Paris Agreement, the success of the Agreement strongly depends on the cooperation of large Multinational Corporations. Short of legal obligations, we discuss the effectiveness and moral legitimacy of voluntary approaches based on naming and shaming. We argue that effectiveness and legitimacy are closely tied together; as voluntary approaches are the only alternative to legally imposed duties, they are most morally defensible particularly if they would be the most effective in reducing the harmful greenhouse gases. Shaming could be made effective if states could prompt more corporations to accept voluntary cuts with high gains-such as public acknowledgements-and high losses, such as reporting on noncompliance and public exposure (naming), along with some kind of condemnation (shaming). An important challenge of such voluntary approaches is how to ensure compliance with the agreed upon commitments, while avoiding greenwashing or selective disclosure. Certain institutional arrangements are inevitable, including an independent measurement, monitoring and verification mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the potentials and ethical pitfalls of shaming as a strategy when corporations have a direct relationship with consumers, but also when they are in a relationship with governments and other corporations.
Management	Research can provide heartwarming experiences which uplift researchers and participants, providing occasions for personal growth and change . Our article makes this case and illustrates heartwarming research experiences using examples from our own research.
History Of Social Sciences	The 1919 Greater Paris competition was the first attempt at metropolitan planning in France. Paris was then the fourth largest city in the world. As in other metropolises, congestion and hazardous urban growth were its main problems. The need of planning was evident. However, the long-term city-suburb conflict, the legal constraints, and the political divergences hindered the realization of a comprehensive plan. In this context, an international competition was launched. The prize-winner was the French architect Leon Jaussely. Although Greater Paris competition did not result in a comprehensive plan straightaway, it constitutes a turning point in Paris's planning history. Through research on unpublished sources preserved in different Parisian archives, this paper aims firstly to reconstruct the process of the competition. The thorough reports of the jury offer an entirely new approach to the study of this kind of competition, since they allow us to comprehend the preoccupations of the administrations in charge. Secondly, it intends to examine the projects, connecting their solutions with international models and debates. It focuses on those concerning the comprehensive plan and particularly on Jaussely's awarded project. Finally, the long-term influence of the competition will be discussed and regarded within the international context.
Communication	Popular conspiracy theories, like those about JFK, the attacks of 9/11, the death of Princess Diana or the swine flu vaccination, are generally depicted in the social sciences as pathological, irrational and, essentially, anti-modern. In this contribution it is instead argued that conspiracy culture is a radical and generalized manifestation of distrust that is embedded in the cultural logic of modernity and, ultimately, produced by processes of modernization. In particular, epistemological doubts about the validity of scientific knowledge claims, ontological insecurity about rationalized social systems like the state, multinationals and the media; and a relentless 'will to believe' in a disenchanted world - already acknowledged by Adorno, Durkheim, Marx and Weber - nowadays motivate a massive turn to conspiracy culture in the West.
Social Issues	In this paper, we analyse the interaction between immigrants' employment in cooperatives and the business cycle. The study is centred on the Spanish economy during the period 2003-2015. The main goal of this paper is to answer the following two key questions: are fluctuations in immigrants' employment in cooperatives cyclical in relation to the business cycle? And, are immigrant employees more vulnerable to the business cycle than native employees? The cycles and their turning points are identified using the Bry and Boschan (Cyclical analysis of time series: selected procedures and computer programmes, National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1971) algorithm. To resolve it we employ the BUSY software, developed by the European Commission. The procedure allows us to identify the features of the cycle phases and to calculate the synchronization index. The results show that (1) employment in cooperatives is procyclical and with no differences between immigrant and native workers, (2) the economic crisis has hit immigrant workers harder than native ones, (3) the immigrants' birthplace is significant because some cyclical behaviour can be found to vary according to the immigrants' origins; however, in general, sensitivity to the business cycle is the common factor.
Nursing	While previous research has examined specific ways that nurses have used smartphones for work purposes in clinical settings, large-sample quantitative studies are limited, particularly in Asia. To address this research gap, this study provided a ranking on how nurses have used their smartphones for work purposes in clinical settings and identified differences based on demographic and organizational factors. In January to June 2017, a pen-and-paper survey was administered to 517 staff nurses employed in 19 tertiary-level general hospitals in Metro Manila, Philippines. Results show that nurses frequently used their smartphones to exchange voice calls and text messages with other nurses and doctors. Results also showed that specific items reflecting the use of smartphones for communication purposes differed according to gender, age, hospital ownership, nursing area, number of patients handled in last shift, and presence of a hospital-provided mobile phone. Next, some items for information-seeking purposes differed according to highest educational attainment and years of clinical experience. Moreover, some items for documentation purposes differed according to age, hospital ownership, and number of patients handled in last shift. Overall, the results of this study can be used to guide policies on the use of smartphones in clinical settings.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Psychological therapy today plays a key role in UK public mental health. In large part, this has been through the development of the (specifically English) Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Through IAPT, millions of citizens have encountered interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy, largely for the treatment of depression and anxiety. This article interrogates how this national response to problems of mental ill-health - and the problematization itself - was developed, accounted for, and sustained. By imbricating economic expertise with accounts of mental ill-health and mechanisms of treatment, IAPT has revivified psychological framings of pathology and therapy. However, it has done so in ways that are more familiar within biomedical contexts (e.g. through recourse to randomized controlled trial studies). Today, the initiative is a principal player in relation to which other services are increasingly developed. Indeed, in many respects IAPT has transformed from content to context within UK public mental health (in a process of what I term 'contextification'). By documenting these developments, this paper contributes to re-centring questions about the place and role of psychology in contemporary healthcare. Doing so helps to complicate assumptions about the dominance of linear forms of (de)biomedicalization in health-systems.
Gerontology	"Background Dysphagia and difficulty with eating affects a significant portion of individuals with advanced dementia. Such problems with oral intake can have serious health consequences including mealtime distress, dehydration and malnutrition, aspiration, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality risk. Design We present the first data indicating that ""Music & Memory"" interventions improve swallowing in individuals with advanced dementia, thereby making oral feeding easier and potentially diminishing reliance on PEG. Setting Columbia Health Care Center, Wyocena, WI (with Music&Memory.org, Mineola, NY and Stony Brook University). Participants Residents with advanced dementia (N = 5). Measurements: Observation by eight professional caregivers. Results (1) Enhanced swallowing mechanism with Music & Memory prior to dining; (2) decreased incidents of choking during mealtime; (3) improved nutritional status; (4) reduced weight loss; (5) reduced need for speech interventions; (6) enhanced quality of life. Conclusions The preliminary results call for additional research."
Education & Educational Research	This paper is a prolegomena to discussions about a differentiated Confucian MBA curriculum. We draw upon Kant's notion of individual autonomy and our observations of practice to argue that there are three models extant for the MBA degree. One of these, that which emphasizes leadership, holds considerable potential if it develops in the context of a genuinely Confucian university. This distinctive MBA-which could emerge in China-would express Confucian metaphysics and thus actively embrace China's history, philosophy and culture. It would manifest as a genuine alternative to the western, globalized, neoliberal MBA. A Confucian MBA would promote a concept of leadership that emphasizes cooperation and other Confucian 'values' (in their full sophistication and complexity) while minimising the role of competition.
Criminology & Penology	"While the economic model of crime suggests that improving post-prison labor market prospects should reduce recidivism, evaluations of previous employment-oriented re-entry programs have mixed results, possibly due to the multi-faceted challenges facing prisoners at the time of their release. We present an evaluation of an experiment that combines enhanced employment opportunities with wrap around services before and after release. This paper presents what we believe is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a re-entry program that combines post-release subsidized work with ""reach-in"" social services provided prior to release. The sample was 236 high-risk offenders in Milwaukee with a history of violence or gang involvement. We observe increased employment rates and earnings during the period when ex-offenders are eligible for subsidized jobs, and these gains persist throughout the year. The intervention has significant effects (p < 0.01) in reducing the likelihood of rearrest. The likelihood that the treatment group is re-imprisoned during the first year after release is lower than for controls (22 vs. 26 %) but the difference is not statistically significantly different from zero. The results of our RCT suggest that ""reach-in"" services to help improve human capital of inmates prior to release, together with wrap around services following release, boosts employment and earnings, although whether there is sufficient impact on recidivism for the intervention to pass a benefit-cost test is more uncertain. Average earnings for both treatment and control groups were very low; legal work simply does not seem that important in the economic lives of released prisoners."
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	We analyse the dependence between defaults in peer-to-peer lending and credit bureaus. To achieve this, we propose a new flexible bivariate regression model that is suitable for binary imbalanced samples. We use different copula functions to model the dependence structure between defaults in the two credit markets. We implement the model in the R package BivGEV and we explore the empirical properties of the proposed fitting procedure by a Monte Carlo study. The application of this proposal to a comprehensive data set provided by Lending Club shows a significant level of dependence between the defaults in peer-to-peer and credit bureaus. Finally, we find that our model outperforms the bivariate probit and univariate logit models in predicting peer-to-peer default, in estimating the value at risk and the expected shortfall.
Ethnic Studies	Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.
Anthropology	This paper provides an analytical review of the development of rural anthropology in Chile. The research is based on an analysis of the rural anthropology studies during the last two decades, which were particularly focused on the changes in the rural society. The authors identified a general tendency to discuss rural phenomena from a descriptive angle, with very few attempts to produce theoretical concepts to understand and interpret the socio-cultural processes that have taken place in the Chilean rural sector. As a result of the study, the authors of this paper propose some guidelines for the development of the field of rural studies during the next decade.
Family Studies	"Living arrangements are influenced by social and demographic trends. Changes in social norms related to marriage, childbearing, educational attainment, and women's employment have reshaped families, making residential family membership much less continuous over the life course. The increasing complexity of family living arrangements makes a life course perspective essential for understanding families. The special issue titled ""Living Arrangements Over the Life Course: Families in the 21st Century"" addresses several key themes that will characterize families in the 21st century, including gender and the family, union formation and dissolution, living arrangements, and family migration."
Ethnic Studies	We describe migrants' early patterns of identification with the receiving society and explain why these differ by migrants' origins. Using longitudinal data from a novel survey among recent immigrants from Poland and Turkey in Germany enables us to analyse the nexus between social assimilation, ethnic boundaries and identification more directly than previous studies. Theoretically, we start out from assimilation theory and its assumption that migrants' identification with the receiving country is a consequence of their preceding social and cognitive assimilation and from the literature on ethnic boundaries. Results suggest that Turkish new migrants start out with higher levels of identification with Germany than Poles. Over time, however, their national identification decreases while it increases for Poles. This is partly explained by the fact that Turkish migrants' social assimilation stagnates; more importantly, only Turks perceive more rather than less discrimination and value incompatibility over time. While both groups' identificational integration with the receiving country thus starts out from different conditions, they do not show a fundamentally dissimilar pattern with respect to the consequences of assimilation and discrimination for their national identification. Yet, the negative impact of the latter is stronger for Turks than for Poles, reflecting the greater salience of ethnic boundaries for this group.
Sociology	On the Ides of March, 44 BC, in the Senate House of Pompey in Rome, Julius Caesar was assassinated by conspirators, the most famous of those being Brutus. Are there objectively valid reasons to confirm the possibility of a suicidal wish on the part of Caesar raised by Suetonius? By building and solving a two-player non-cooperative game that models the historical strategic aspects of the relationship between Caesar and Brutus, our article shows that there is no need to subscribe to the suicide thesis to explain Caesar's death. We formulate our conclusion via the solution concept of mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This paper analyses the changing conceptualisation of cellular differentiation during the twentieth century. This involved a move away from a view of this process as irreversible to an understanding of it as contingent. We examine the import of this shift for the transformation of stem cell biology, including the therapeutic promise attributed to this field, and how it came to challenge historical conceptions of both the cell and stem cell. We take as our starting point the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine awarded jointly to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. In the view of the Nobel Committee, their work delineates a paradigm shift in the understanding of cellular differentiation, one that incorporates the concept of 'plasticity'. We explore the emergence, uses and meanings of this concept within this specific biological context, examining and emphasising its role as an epistemological tool. In this setting, 'plasticity' was introduced by cell biologist Helen Blau in the course of research undertaken in the 1980s into the genetics of cell differentiation. We argue that Blau's experimental and theoretical contributions were seminal to a reconceptualisation of this process and provide a crucial link between the work of Gurdon and Yamanaka. Overall, the paper highlights the contested process of conceptual change within the biomedical sciences. It also draws attention to the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between conceptual and technical change, exemplified here in the changing conceptions of cell differentiation following from the analysis of gene expression using new cell fusion and cloning techniques. More broadly, the paper also affords a window onto the shifting priorities, goals and values within late twentieth-century biomedical research.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Emilie Du Chatelet is well known for her French translation of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. It is the first and only French translation of Newton's magnum opus. The complete work appeared in 1759 under the title Principes mathematiques de la philosophie naturelle, par feue Madame la Marquise Du Chastellet. Before translating Newton's Principia, Du Chatelet worked on her Institutions de physique. In this book she defended the Leibnizian concept of living forces vis viva. This paper argues that both of these works were part of a critical transformation and consolidation of post-Newtonian mechanics in the early 18th century, beyond Newton and Leibniz. This will be shown by comparing Du Chatelet's translation of Newton's axioms with her own formulations of the laws of motion in light of Thomas Le Seur's and Francois Jacquier's Geneva edition which holds a special place among the several editions of the Principia that appeared in the early 18th century.

History & Philosophy Of Science	Creating agents that proficiently interact with people is critical for many applications. Towards creating these agents, models are needed that effectively predict people's decisions in a variety of problems. To date, two approaches have been suggested to generally describe people's decision behavior. One approach creates a-priori predictions about people's behavior, either based on theoretical rational behavior or based on psychological models, including bounded rationality. A second type of approach focuses on creating models based exclusively on observations of people's behavior. At the forefront of these types of methods are various machine learning algorithms. This paper explores how these two approaches can be compared and combined in different types of domains. In relatively simple domains, both psychological models and machine learning yield clear prediction models with nearly identical results. In more complex domains, the exact action predicted by psychological models is not even clear, and machine learning models are even less accurate. Nonetheless, we present a novel approach of creating hybrid methods that incorporate features from psychological models in conjunction with machine learning in order to create significantly improved models for predicting people's decisions. To demonstrate these claims, we present an overview of previous and new results, taken from representative domains ranging from a relatively simple optimization problem and complex domains such as negotiation and coordination without communication.
Linguistics	This article seeks to provide a parsimonious generative account of the relationship between Zulu nouns and their prefixes, and between the singular and plural forms of nouns. It has been suggested that in the Bantu languages the latter relationship can best be described by assuming that nouns are marked for a feature gender, and that the feature class can be derived from the combination of the features gender and number. These claims lead to considerable redundancy if applied to a language like Zulu. A more parsimonious grammar can be achieved by assuming that Zulu nouns are lexically marked for class, and that plurals of count nouns, rather than being inflections, are regularly and productively derived from the singular.
Education & Educational Research	In recent years, online teaching and training with MOOCs has become increasingly important. This is demonstrated by the number of publications about them. Here we present a meta-analysis of the research that has been performed, focusing on the educational opportunities provided by MOOCs. This study was conducted using Social Sciences peer review open journal publications from the last five years (2011-2016). These indexed publications can be found in the following databases: JCR, Scimago Journal-SCOPUS, and Sello Fecyt. The main result obtained was quantitative data gathered from questionnaires referring to the most worked area of materials and content design. As an initial conclusion, it identifies a need to broaden the scope of study to include more general educational journals.
Anthropology	Because of the greater morphological distances among them, genera should be more robustly recognizable in the fossil record than species are. But there are clearly upper as well as lower bounds to their species inclusivity. Currently, the vast majority of fossils composing the large and rapidly expanding paleoanthropological record are crammed into one of two genera (Australopithecus vs Homo), expanding the latter, especially, far beyond any reasonable morphological or phylogenetic limits. This excessive inclusivity obscures both diversity and the complexities of phylogenetic structure within the hominid family.
Women'S Studies	"Dominant Western discourses of motherhood have depicted disabled women as incapable of being mothers. In contrast to these representations, recent literature in disability studies has argued that disabled women can provide maternal care and should therefore retain custody over their children. This literature is commendable, but its emphasis on custodial rights excludes from the category of ""mother"" those disabled women who cannot maintain child custody. In this article, I challenge this exclusion via an account of my experience with my two mothers: my biological mother, who relinquished custody over me because of her inability to provide care, and my maternal grandmother, who raised me as her child. Theorizing this account, I argue that disability studies must adopt a conception of motherhood that recognizes both alternative kinship structures and mothers whose disabilities preclude them from fulfilling normative conceptions of maternal care. I develop such a conception by synthesizing Judith Butler's theorization of queer kinship with Donald Winnicott's rethinking of the maternal subject. I conclude by drawing on this flexible conception of motherhood to argue that my disabled mother's relinquishing of custody over me to her own mother was the very gesture in which she accepted and adopted a maternal role."
Anthropology	For several years, aid programs in the Mekong region have taken an increasing interest in cross-border mobility and human trafficking and its relationship with development. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in the identification of trafficked victims and the investigation, arrest and prosecution of traffickers. Whereas anti-trafficking programs ubiquitously define themselves as being in a battle with traffickers, this article argues that although they are not homologous social actors, both engage in acts of bad faith. The article elaborates this argument by drawing attention to the recruitment process within the Lao sex industry as well as to the way in which aid programs attempt to identify trafficked victims. It concludes that imaginary aspects of development underpin a simultaneous disjuncture yet enable the social reproduction of the life worlds of 'traffickers' and 'anti-traffickers' alike.
Transportation	Crash prediction models or safety performance functions can be used for estimating the number of crashes and evaluating roadway safety. Developing a new model can be a difficult task and requires a significant amount of time and energy. To simplify the process, the Highway Safety Manual provides safety performance functions for conducting different types of safety analyses for several facilities. However, because data collected from a few selected states for a specific period of time were considered for fitting and validating these models, they are required to be calibrated to the conditions of the new jurisdiction, and as well need to be revisited for recalibration over time. Therefore, the analyst may need to know when or how often the models are recommended to be recalibrated. This article addresses this question and documents recommendations that are based on the general characteristics of data. The proposed procedure only requires (1) the total number of crashes, (2) the average traffic flow, and (3) the total segment length (or number of intersections) in the network. The method was validated with different empirical datasets collected in Texas and Michigan. The results show that the proposed procedure provides useful information about when recalibration is recommended.
Ethnic Studies	"Since the 1970s, a number of African American writers, including Toni Morrison, Gayl Jones, Danzy Senna, and Elizabeth Alexander, have developed literary works around Brazilian spiritual, cultural, and social formations. Advancing within a hemispheric context Houston Baker's concept of an ""oceanic critical consciousness,'' this article examines how narrative representations of Candomble' in Toni Morrison's Paradise (1997) prompt acts of self-reconstruction that penetrate the national borders framing certain notions of African American identity in the post-Civil Rights era. The author argues for greater recognition of the abiding yet often ambivalent transnationality of African American identity and its employment, particularly by women writers, in contemporary African American literature. The article suggests that African American literature and U. S. blackness in general must be resituated in global terms and that one way of doing so is through the figure of the woman spiritually reconstituted through transnationally rooted practice."
Ethnic Studies	In 2007 then French president Nicolas Sarkozy established the Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Cooperative Development. Ocak investigates what the ministry wanted to achieve by promoting national identity and linking it with immigration. Focusing on the so-called selective immigration policies and the national identity debate, she examines the ways in which neoliberalization hollows out the nation-state and transforms its relations vis-a-vis citizens and, as a result, increases the need to perform sovereignty to counterbalance the crisis of the welfare state. The articulation of the undesired immigrant figure and the project to engage French citizens in the management of the immigrant operate, she suggests, as tactics to smooth this transformation and compensate for the losses that the French citizens experience as a result of the reign of neoliberal policies.
Ethnic Studies	The arrival of thousands of European Roma seeking refugee status in Canada elicited a range of legislative and policy instruments that severely restrict their acceptance and create conditions antagonistic to further admissions. Interventions have included visa restrictions, actions by Immigration and Refugee Board, the Balanced Refugee Reform Act followed by the Protecting Canada's Immigration System Act, and ministerial rhetoric about the illegitimacy of Roma as refugees. Other factors have involved interpretations of persecution in relation to the Geneva Convention and Protocol, and the implications of the conditions required for membership to the European Union. These political circumstances in large part determine Canadian acceptance rates for the Roma. Their systematic exclusion is reminiscent of the historical treatment of other groups due to institutional racism. In the new racism, however, refugee law and policy is racist in effect while evading the language of race.
Industrial Relations & Labor	In this study, the authors seek to account for possible transitions from temporary to permanent employment in relation to perceived psychosocial work characteristics, i.e. job insecurity, workload, job control and organizational communication. The study compared three groups of Finnish hospital workers utilizing a two-wave design with a two-year time lag: (1) workers who were temporarily employed at Time 1 but permanently employed at Time 2 (temporary-to-permanent workers; n = 25); (2) workers who were temporarily employed at Time 1 and at Time 2 (long-term temporary workers; n = 45); and (3) a reference group of workers who were permanently employed at Time 1 and Time 2 (permanent workers; n = 316). The results showed that temporary-to-permanent workers experienced less job insecurity but more workload at Time 2 than at Time 1. Furthermore, long-term temporary workers experienced higher workload at Time 2 than at Time 1, and they also reported a negative change in organizational communication during the follow-up.
Business, Finance	"Credit derivatives are the latest in a series of innovations that have had a significant impact on credit markets. Using a micro data set of individual corporate loans. this paper explores whether use of credit derivatives is associated with an increase in bank credit supply. We find only limited evidence that greater use of credit derivatives is associated with greater Supply of bank credit. The strongest effect is for large term loans-newly negotiated loan extensions to large corporate borrowers, with a largely negative impact on (previously negotiated) commitment lending. Even for large term borrowers, increases in the volume of credit are offset by higher spreads. These findings suggest that the benefits of the growth of credit derivatives may be narrow, accruing mainly to large firms that are likely to be ""named credits"" in these transactions. Finally, use of credit derivatives appears to be complementary to other forms of hedging by banks, though the banks most active in hedging appear to charge more for additional amounts of credit.

Anthropology	Grouping techniques employ similarities within data to create new entities, which lend themselves to the interpretation process. This article presents three different grouping approaches, each originally developed independently, and applied to a common dataset of archaeological finds. The aim is not to search for the right approach or results, in a competing way, but rather to present the methods as complementary. It is also our intention to stress that a tight connection between theory and statistical modelling is indispensable. Indeed, the use of a particular methodology must be supported by an adapted theory; similarly, a theory without a proper methodological realisation will often not have any actual utility. The integration of theory and method is exemplified in the three case methods. The first method uses metal objects as cultural indicators. The study area is divided into a set of identical geographical units, characterized according to the type and proportions of indicators and grouped using hierarchical clustering. The second approach deals with cultures as standardisations between individuals, using 'Typenspektrum' as significant data for identifying different cultures. Groups are defined through kernel density estimation and a cluster analysis, followed by internal and external validation techniques. A third method characterizes the funerary ritual and grave-goods, using a similarity algorithm coupled with clustering procedures to compare the graves with one another. The outcome is validated with exploratory methods and compared to patterns from different contexts. The complementarity of the results shows that each approach sheds light on a certain facet of the same whole.
Sociology	Although socioeconomic status has been positively linked to health, little is known how socioeconomic disadvantage experienced in both childhood and adulthood influences cardiovascular illness in low- and middle-income countries. With particular emphasis on the elderly, this research uses Latin American data to test whether adult socioeconomic disadvantage, net of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage, is associated with being diagnosed with hypertension and experiencing a heart attack. This research also explores how location plays a role in the relationship between socioeconomic status and health by providing country-specific analyses. Findings indicate that while adult socioeconomic status is negatively associated with cardiovascular illness in the region overall, this relationship is positive in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. Results suggest that, in the case of elderly Latin Americans, socioeconomic advantage did not uniformly translate into a definite health advantage. Resume Bien que le statut socio-economique soit positivement associe a la sante, il existe encore peu de donnees relatives aux effets des desavantages socio-economiques sur les maladies cardio-vasculaires dans les pays a revenus faibles ou intermediaires. En mettant l'accent sur les personnes agees, cette etude se base sur des donnees recueillies en Amerique Latine pour verifier dans quelle mesure les desavantages socio-economiques chez les adultes, sans prendre en compte les inegalites sociales d'origine, peuvent etre associees aux diagnostics de l'hypertension arterielle et aux infarctus. En fournissant des analyses specifiques pour chaque pays, cet article explore aussi le role joue par le lieu dans la relation entre le statut socio-economique et la sante. Les resultats indiquent que le statut socio-economique chez les adultes est associe positivement aux maladies cardio-vasculaires dans toute la region latino-americaine, a l'exception de l'Argentine, du Bresil et du Chili. Ces donnees suggerent que les avantages socio-economiques ne se traduisent pas automatiquement par des avantages en termes de sante pour les personnes agees en Amerique Latine. Resumen Pese a que el nivel socioeconomico ha sido correlacionado positivamente con la salud, poco se sabe de que manera la desventaja socioeconomica experimentada en la ninez y la edad adulta, influye en la enfermedad cardiovascular en paises de bajos y medianos ingresos. Con especial enfasis en las personas mayores, esta investigacion utiliza datos de America Latina para probar si la desventaja socioeconomica en adultos, neto de la desventaja socioeconomica infancia, se asocia a ser diagnosticado de hipertension y de experimentar un ataque al corazon. Esta investigacion tambien explora como la ubicacion juega un papel en la relacion entre el estatus socioeconomico y la salud, proporcionando analisis especificos para cada pais. Los resultados indican que, si bien el nivel socioeconomico de adultos esta asociado positivamente con la enfermedad cardiovascular en la region en general, esta relacion es negativa en Argentina, Brasil y Chile. Los resultados sugieren que, en el caso de personas mayores de latinoamericanas, la ventaja socioeconomica no se tradujo de manera uniforme a una ventaja de salud definida.
Family Studies	Familismo, or familism, an important Latino cultural construct associated with youth adjustment, describes the importance of family regarding support, comfort, and services. Increased research on familism among Latino families in the past decade has called for a theoretical process model of familism that can guide research on familism, family processes, and youth development. In this article, we propose the behavioral process model of familism (BPMF), which identifies proximal mechanisms through which familism is expected to promote youth psychological adjustment. Specifically, we propose that parenting behaviors (e.g., monitoring, discipline strategies) are a mechanism by which parent familism relates to youth familism and psychological adjustment both directly and via their familism-consistent behaviors. We hypothesize direct and mediated pathways in the BPMF and consider how sociodemographic variables modify the described processes.
Business	"This study aims to contribute to the understanding of business news coverage of corporate social responsibility (CSR) within a comparative international context by investigating two business newspapers, The Wall Street Journal from the United States and The Financial Times from the United Kingdom. Drawing on the news framing research and the implicit and explicit CSR framework of Matten and Moon, this content analysis shows that business news coverage of CSR in the United States and in the United Kingdom differs in terms of news framing (thematic vs. episodic), motive attributions of CSR as a concept, motive attributions of referenced companies in relation to CSR, general tone toward the concept of CSR, and the general tone toward referenced companies in relation to CSR. Most significantly, findings suggest that business news plays different roles in constructing and legitimizing CSR in the two countries. In the United States, CSR""s legitimacy and its conceptual positivity may be more implied through the coverage of singular events or actors (episodic framing), whereas in the United Kingdom, CSR""s illegitimacy and its conceptual negativity may be more exposed for further discussion through the coverage of larger societal contexts (thematic framing). Other theoretical as well as practical implications are also discussed."
Information Science & Library Science	Linking a learning dataset to useful information on the Web of Data enriches its learning resources, as it enhances learners' knowledge. This enrichment is usually achieved by creating links between datasets using the interlinking tools, which facilitate connecting any kind of data in a semi-automatic manner. This paper evaluates the interlinking results between an e-learning repository and several educational datasets on the Web of Data, which leads to enrichment of the contents. Many related resources were discovered during this experimentation already matched to the GLOBE learning objects. Furthermore, this research presents a data model to find similarity between two datasets and a workflow to identify the duplicate resources by performing a semi-automatic evaluation process. A case study was also assessed by human experts.
Transportation	"This paper contributes to the research on non-reporting effects in mixed-method household travel surveys (HTS) in two ways: Firstly, we compare travel activities reported in the established Austrian National HTS (ANTS) with an innovative survey approach, the so-called ""Mobility-Activity-Expenditure Diary"" (MAED), and secondly we extend the analysis to (i) additional travel estimates and to (ii) non-travel activities. The analysis addresses three main goals: (i) identification of non-reporting effects in the HTS for travel estimates, (ii) analysis of speed-of-response effects on travel estimates, (iii) assessment of the completeness and accuracy of nontravel activities inferred from the trip purposes in the HTS. Underreporting in HTS occurs both on person level and on the trip level, and mainly for peak-hour trips with either short distances or short durations of the subsequent non-travel activity. No significant underreporting was found on the tour level. Speed-of-response effects are small in both surveys but significant for the ANTS. The duration of non-travel activities per activity type corresponds well in the MAED-survey and in the ANTS but the information in the MAED-survey is much richer. The results can be used threefold: (i) to develop correction factors that account for systematic biases in HTS, (ii) to identify omitted items (trip frequency, duration, distance etc.) if HTS data are used without correction factors, and (iii) to demonstrate the importance of high quality field work and validation."
History & Philosophy Of Science	In this paper, it is argued that the most fruitful approach to developing normative models of argument quality is one that combines the argumentation scheme approach with Bayesian argumentation. Three sample argumentation schemes from the literature are discussed: the argument from sign, the argument from expert opinion, and the appeal to popular opinion. Limitations of the scheme-based treatment of these argument forms are identified and it is shown how a Bayesian perspective may help to overcome these. At the same time, the contributions of the standard scheme-based approach are highlighted, and it is argued that only a combination of the insights of different traditions will yield a complete normative theory of argument quality.
Social Work	Two studies conducted in Massachusetts and Nevada evaluated the efficacy of a self-help toolkit for problem gambling. Individuals concerned about gambling-related problems, in response to public notices and newspaper advertisements, volunteered for a randomized trial of the self-help toolkit, Your First Step to Change: Gambling. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a printed toolkit, (b) the toolkit and a brief guide to the toolkits content, or (c) assignment to a wait-list condition. Participants, 145 in Massachusetts and 170 in Nevada, reported their gambling behavior, beliefs and attitudes about chance, and recent and planned help seeking at baseline, 88% at 1 month later, and 79% at 3 months later. Findings for the complete and intent-to-treat analyses at both sites indicated that participants significantly improved. At the end of the study period, significantly more toolkit recipients than control group participants reported recently abstaining from gambling. Minimally invasive, self-directed resources like this self-help toolkit can assist remediating gambling-related problems among gamblers who do not engage in formal treatment.
Management	Firms from developed nations are increasingly resorting to business process outsourcing (BPO) as part of their global Sourcing strategy. Although BPO is a growing practice. there has been limited empirical attention in understanding the phenomenon, particularly from the perspective of provider firms that execute important business processes for their overseas clients. In this paper we focus on the resources and capabilities that are utilized by the providers in fulfilling their clients' sourcing needs. Using resource-based view and social exchange as theoretical foundations, we argue that providers' human capital, organizational capital, management capability, and partnership quality are crucial assets that are deemed valuable by the clients and are utilized by the providers in attaining higher performance. Using a sample of Indian BPO providers, we empirically test three models (direct, mediating and moderating) to understand how these assets impact firm-level performance. Results show that resources and capabilities relate to performance in varying measures and partnership quality has partial-mediating and moderating effects on these relationships. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the study and highlighting avenues of future inquiry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (or heterodox health care) functions as the primary source of health care for a majority of populations in low-income countries. The World Health Organization has promoted the integration of heterodox health-care practices and practitioners into formal state and local biomedical health-care systems. Heretofore, the literature has assumed the beneficence of this policy in reducing health-care disparity, without assessing the outcomes of this policy's implementation. This research examines the impact of health-care integration policy on local health care in communities in four municipalities in the Philippines. Communities in two municipalities that implemented health-care integration (top-down and bottom-up) were compared with two municipalities that did not implement health-care integration. A qualitative design of data collection was utilised. Convenience samples (n = 500) of community members, community leaders, health-care providers and key policy actors participated in semi-structured interviews and focus groups to assess the changes in community health-care systems and in community health-care access following health-care integration. The assumptions of beneficence of health-care integration are not supported by this research. Furthermore, this research suggests that health-care integration may not be beneficial to communities if implemented in a manner that ignores the particular needs of a given local context.

Transportation	The purpose of this article is to seek to reconstruct the ownership transformation involving Poland's State Road Transport (PKS) companies passed through after 1990. Data collected from various sources (above all the Internet) were used to establish the degree of advancement of the transformation processes. Despite the passage of 18 years since the new economic reforms were launched, privatization processes are not well advanced. State ownership remains dominant, in the form of Treasury companies as well as state-owned enterprises. Privatization processes have encompassed fewer than half of all firms, the most popular form taken (in about a quarter of all analysed cases) involving leasing by workers. This would seem of major interest, attesting as it does to the greater activity of some worker's teams, as well as the passive role of the state in privatization processes. A much smaller number of firms (26) have been purchased by external investors, the only important international concern among these being Veolia, which had taken control of 11 PKS companies as of mid-2006. By and large, it is the firms carrying passengers or passenger and goods that are in a much better situation, as opposed to the companies that are commodity-carriers only. The majority of the latter have collapsed, or have undergone the kind of privatization that involves simultaneous shutdown. Mixed passenger and goods carriers have had to reduce their level of activity in commodity transport.
Communication	This article provides an empirical, field-based study of the production processes of transnational media outlet, the International Herald Tribune, as it negotiates and coordinates workflow and content with The New York Times. Using Manuel Castells' concept of the space of flows, the article provides additional nuance to understand the relationship between material constructs and networked information. Time zones and geolocation remain important; the biggest node in the network does direct information; and the coordinated capacity for 24/7 content is more difficult that perhaps imagined by networked scholars. Both people and product are considered here in an effort to bring added nuance to the tension between materiality and networks in the production of information. While the International Herald Tribune has now been rebranded as the International New York Times, the same considerations and questions remain.
Ethnic Studies	Men dominate the electorates of populist radical-right political parties across Europe. That is a matter of empirical fact. Why women resist such parties remains subject to debate. One approach suggests that there is a fundamental mismatch between the ideological profile of populist radical parties and the values and priorities held by most women. Another theory highlights men's concentration in the blue-collar occupations most threatened by socio-economic modernization. Women's over-representation in service jobs is thought to insulate them from the sense of economic vulnerability that animates male enthusiasm for the far right. Other approaches emphasize factors that render conservative women unavailable to populist right-wing parties, despite a degree of ideological affinity. Montgomery draws on electorate survey data to explain the gender gap in voting for post-Communist Hungary's extreme-right anti-Roma party, Jobbik. She discusses key East-West differences and several unique features of Hungarian party political development, but her emphasis is on the interaction among key variables identified in the general literature. Findings therefore contribute to broad debates about what drives (or may inhibit) the growth and governing power of populist radical-right parties.
Substance Abuse	BackgroundPrevious single country research has raised concerns that: (1) the DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse (AA) is met primarily through the hazardous use criterion related to drinking and driving and (2) that the hazardous use and social consequences AA criteria primarily reflect varying socioeconomic and cultural factors rather than psychiatric disorder. MethodsUsing representative cross-national data from the 21 countries in the World Mental Health surveys, adults meeting DSM-IV lifetime criteria for AA but not dependence from 10 developed (n=46,071) and 11 developing (n=49,761) countries were assessed as meeting AA with the hazardous use or the social consequences criteria. ResultsBetween 29.3% (developed) and 16.2% (developing) of respondents with AA met only the hazardous use criterion. AA cases with and without hazardous use were similar in age-of-onset, course, predictors, and psychopathological consequences in both developed and developing countries. Discussion and ConclusionsDespite some associations of the AA criteria with socioeconomic factors, the hazardous use and social consequences criteria were significantly associated with psychiatric predictors and sequelae. The findings indicate that these criteria reflect psychiatric disorder and are appropriate for inclusion as DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder criteria. Scientific SignificanceThese findings support a psychiatric rather than a sociocultural view of the hazardous use and social consequences symptoms and provide evidence that they are appropriate diagnostic criteria cross-nationally with utility in a wide range of socioeconomic environments. This suggests consideration for their adoption by ICD-11. Further research is needed on the implications of these results for prevention and treatment. (Am J Addict 2014;23:145-155)
Public Administration	The possibility of an influenza pandemic occurring within the next two decades is very real; the role of local governments in comprehensive preparation for this global threat is crucial. The federal government has provided broad guidelines for state and local officials who are ultimately responsible for emergency response and lifesaving services, vaccination and antiviral use, and the provision of other critical support. Much of this influenza pandemic preparedness has occurred under conditions of uncertainty, and these government actions may have unprecedented legal and ethical implications. This study evaluates the pandemic influenza policies of eight large U.S. cities to determine how Department of Health and Human Services recommendations with ethical and legal implications have been addressed. The authors find that several important aspects of these guidelines are vague in many plans, and input from key stakeholders is inadequate.
Development Studies	Emerging issues from the Bui hydropower project suggest that the experiences of two earlier hydropower projects in Ghana failed to prevent challenges related to resource access and livelihoods. This article examines the nature of the challenges, their causes, why they were not avoided and the role of the Chinese builders. We conducted 43 interviews and 11 focus group discussions and analyzed qualitative data by themes using narrative analysis. Our findings show that the livelihoods of the resettled communities are, on balance, negatively impacted by the construction of the dam. While Chinese dam-builders played a major role in financing and enabling the dam's construction, the Ghanaian governance arrangements were found to be more important in addressing the livelihood challenges.
Business, Finance	In this paper, I use U.S. call report data to construct a larger panel dataset with bank-level observations. I find that larger banks' lending is considerably more sensitive to the strength of their borrowers' and their own balance sheets compared to smaller banks and that the sensitivities to borrower balance sheets are larger in magnitude compared to lender balance sheets. When I incorporate various macroeconomic shocks (identified by an estimated DSGE model) into the empirical model, I similarly find that the transmission of shocks to the real economy operates mostly through large bank lending and borrower balance sheets.

Social Work	This study uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted in Philadelphia to estimate the prevalence of youth homelessness and risk for problems in the areas of victimization, binge drinking, serious substance use, and mental health. The YRBS is an anonymous, self-report survey that produces population-representative estimates for all Philadelphia high school students. About 16.3% of all youths reported having experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, and 11.7% reported current or recent homelessness. Homelessness, especially current or recent homelessness, was associated with higher levels of victimization and higher likelihood of experiencing a behavioral health problem. Follow-up tests generally confirm the presence of a risk gradient for each individual outcome wherein never-homeless students show the lowest level of risk, students who had been homeless only in the past an intermediate level of risk, and currently or recently homeless students the highest level of risk. Results are consistent with the view that homelessness represents a period of crisis or acute risk that challenges positive adaptation, often in the context of chronic risk.
Business	This article explores how the institutional context, including central and local governments, has co-evolved with business in relation to small cars and sustainability. This issue is very relevant for business and society in view of the environmental implications of the rapidly growing vehicle fleet in China, the economic importance attached to this pillar industry by the government, and citizen interest in owning and driving increasingly larger cars. The interactions between different levels of government, and with business (both domestic and foreign-invested) in countries with a large role for the state is a novel area of study in the business-society area and a complex one given the multitude of objectives and interests involved in industry competitiveness, economic development, energy security, and sustainability. The article shows that the central government has adopted policies to further the production and use of small cars, which it perceives as serving environmental, economic, and social goals. Concurrently, however, many local governments imposed restrictions on small cars and have, implicitly or explicitly, favored larger cars. There seems to be a clear linkage to municipal ownership of those domestic automobile companies which, via joint ventures with foreign firms, focused more on larger cars. By adopting a co-evolutionary approach focused on macro-level interactions, the case helps to shed some more light on concrete sustainability challenges, and broader government-business interactions in a highly institutionalized setting, contributing insights on issues that have remained underexposed in business and society research.
Social Issues	The role of the individual scientist as a socialization agent (i.e., an actor who contributes to embedding technology into society) is increasingly emphasized in science policy. This article analyzes offshore wind scientists' narratives about science-technology-society relations and their role in them. It particularly focuses on the nuanced and detailed reasons that scientists give for their level of engagement with society. The analysis is based on semistructured individual and focus group interviews with thirty-five scientists. It finds a diversity of narratives related to the questions of whether socialization of technology is needed and which approaches to socialization scientists should pursue. The six narratives identified are (1) upstream engagement, (2) design against resistance, (3) the outreaching scientist, (4) the difficulty of outreach, (5) the outsourcing scientist, and (6) disembedded development of technology. Despite the importance attributed to scientists for the socialization of science and technology, most interviewed scientists did not embrace their role as socialization agent. Based on the scientists' narratives, this article argues that we should rethink both who should be responsible for socialization and what should be the object of sciences' engagement with society.
Education, Special	This study examined the global quality of early care and education settings and individual children's experiences in those settings. Sixty 4- to 5-year-old children (30 with disabilities and 30 without disabilities) were observed using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) and items from the ECERS-R adapted to focus on individual children's experiences. Early childhood global quality had the largest effect on individual children's experiences, after controlling for maternal education and child problem behavior. This relationship varied by children's problem behavior but not by disability status. When parents reported more problem behavior in children in classrooms of higher global quality (ECERS-R score), individualized ECERS-R experience ratings were lower.
Management	This paper investigates the problem of retaining business school graduates after they have completed a trainee program in a company. Often when a company invests in training programs for young graduates, the company's management expects that a graduate will remain with the company for a long time. But in some cases, the trainees decide to leave. This research shows the different perceptions among the trainees and the company of motives or reasons for such a decision. The main findings also indicate a significant difference in the graduates' preferences in the countries being compared and suggest a list of motives that drive such decision making. Furthermore, managerial applications are given and the possible approaches for future discussions are suggested.
Sociology	"Biophilia is commonly defined as the inborn predisposition to affiliate with, or to attend to, natural or natural-like elements and processes. In this paper, I explore whether there is sufficient reason to conclude that the therapeutic or ameliorative effects of animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) are a token of biophilia. Based on a conceptual analysis of the notion, I argue that to this day the exact meaning of ""biophilia"" remains inherently vague because several of its constituent claims have been left underspecified by theorists in the field. Although this vagueness allows one to consider most if not all-AAI findings as instances of biophilic responses, this barely seems to be a theoretically useful insight. My overall conclusion is that it is imprudent to associate AAI research with a concept whose scientific merits and explanatory potential still remain unclear and underspecified."
Public Administration	The aim of my study is to show on the one hand the conceptual, legal and methodological basics of social participation, on the other hand the form of the social participation in the local development based on researches. At first I show the definitions of local development, local development policy, social participation and civil/nonprofit organisations. It follows the legal background of the social participation, including also the shortcomings of the laws. Then I show the methods of the social participation. The main part of my study is to show how these methods appear in the Hungarian local development process mainly based on researches by Hungarian researchers and on my PhD research in 2007 The main establishment of my study, that there are lots of laws in Hungary on social participation, but these laws allows only the consultation and not using the wide range of methods. Therefore the activity of the civil/nonprofit organisations in social participation is not typical, even most of the civil/nonprofit organisations dealing with settlement development do not appear in the local development.
Management	Responding to the climate change challenge requires a massive development and diffusion of carbon neutral technologies and, thus, emergence and growth of new socio-technical systems. This paper contributes to an improved understanding of the formative phase of new technological innovation systems (TIS) by outlining a framework for analysing TIS dynamics in terms of structural growth and key innovation-related processes (functions) and by discussing two of these functions at some depth: legitimation and development of positive externalities. Empirical examples are provided from case studies on renewable energy technologies. We highlight the problematic role of technology assessment studies in shaping legitimacy and the importance of early market formation for the emergence of packs of entrepreneurs that may contribute to legitimation, and discuss how exploitation of overlaps between different TISs may create positive externalities, opening up for a powerful bottom-up process of system growth. Associated policy and management challenges are identified.
Education & Educational Research	This article describes an innovative curriculum design that has been created at a research-intensive university to prepare Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) for their role as teachers within higher education. The underlying concepts and frameworks for the design of the programme are discussed in depth in an attempt to unpack the assumptions that are routinely made about GTAs, their training needs and requirements as students. The finished product was a more effective curriculum that took account of a number of significant factors throughout the design process. These factors included flexibility in terms of GTAs making their own choices about the direction of their learning, and the importance of discipline-based teaching to inform practice. Preliminary indicators, for example student evaluations and student focus group data suggest that the revised curriculum better addresses and responds to the needs of the GTAs than the previous curriculum.
Public Administration	This study posits a theoretical framework for understanding the role and value of agency input in presidential-legislative policy making. The author asserts that by using agency input for policy development, presidents instill their proposals with a degree of bureaucratic objectivity, expertise, process transparency, and agency support, which aids their legislative passage while lowering the extent of changes made to policy substance in the process. To test his hypotheses, the author conducts binary and ordered logistic regression analyses using pooled cross-sectional data across 12 administrations from 1949 to 2010. The author finds that agency input serves as a key component for increased presidential-legislative success.
Ethnic Studies	Islamophobic mobilization has become a crucial aspect of right-wing populist mobilization. Hafez's article focuses on the case of the Visegrad Four countries: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Based on reportedly widespread hostility against Muslims among the population in this region, one would assume a large potential for street-level activism analogous to the German Pegida. Yet, attempts to organize grassroots Islamophobic movements have not been particularly successful in the Visegrad Four. Using social movement theory, Hafez explains this by the fact that the issue of Muslim migration has been appropriated by the ruling parties, leaving little opportunity for independent grassroots mobilization.
Sociology	Feminist Standpoint Theory identifies knowledge as a social product developed from a specific social position. We apply this theory to explore the dominant standpoint informing the social organization of Western art via an institution we call art/criticism. We find that the assumptions, values, and analytic strategies informing mainstream art and art criticism express the standpoint of privileged men. As a test of our argument, we consider the case of an artist who is often hailed as a feminist artist and yet is one of the most successful woman artists today: Cindy Sherman. We find that while Sherman is working with some fertile possibilities for feminist analysis, her work ends up re-directing this potential into a disempowering play with images. We conclude that rather than countering our argument, the celebration of Sherman's work as feminist reveals the workings, as well as the limits, of the privileged male standpoint in art.
Management	How do innovators in large organizations acquire resources for their early-stage, untested, unproven innovations? Multiple established projects compete for scarce resources in large organizations. Innovators pursuing early-stage, untested innovations face considerable constraints in accessing scarce resources. Literature enumerates various sanctioned and unsanctioned methods by which innovators acquire resources, such as borrowing, begging, scavenging, amplifying, bootlegging, and finagling - defined as obtaining resources through deceitful or underhanded methods. However, few theories explain how innovators act unconventionally, elude constraints to acquire resources, and yet gain acceptance for their innovations. To address this question, this study uses field data from nine organizations based primarily in Silicon Valley. Successful innovators employ organizational ingenuity or creative solutions to gain resources in the face of constraints. They employ two types of ingenuity: material ingenuity, creatively re-imagining the use of resources; and process ingenuity, using creative processes to gain resources. In the early stages, innovators focus on managing their innovation's legitimacy and use managerial attention as a key lever. They maximize managerial attention when employing material ingenuity and minimize managerial attention when utilizing process ingenuity. Theories highlighting the relationship between legitimacy and resource acquisition suggest that individuals gain resources when they establish legitimacy. Conversely, study results indicate that the process of gaining resources can lend legitimacy to early-stage innovations.
Development Studies	Using the case study of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and the 2017 independence referendum, this article examines the nexus between independence referendums, nationalism and political power. It argues that the referendum in the KRI was held due to internal political competition and growing rebellion from the population against the poor economic performance and political situation rather than because the time was right for independence referendum. Focusing on the poor political and financial dynamics, as well as the lack of regional and international support for Kurdish independence, the article argues that independence was not a realistic goal and was rather used as a distraction amid internal turmoil. The example of the referendum in the KRI poses questions about the democratic credibility of such referenda, as the population were voting for an unachievable result and the referendum itself became a tool of internal political competition.
Criminology & Penology	Purpose - The aim of the present study is to examine, in detail, the magnitude and profile of police turnover across Australasia. Design/methodology/approach - Sworn officer turnover statistics (total separations and voluntary resignations) for four financial years were collected from all Australian and New Zealand police jurisdictions. Comparisons were made with the Australian and international public sector. The age and years of service of resigning officers were also obtained. Findings - Despite concerns about the high level of turnover, benchmarking data showed that total police turnover was lower than in other Australian public sector organizations and comparable with that in international public sector organizations. Voluntary resignations were also lower in policing than in the Australian public sector, but higher than in the international public sector. Further, resignations were the major form of turnover, and female officers resigned at a higher rate than male officers with a peak in the 25-39-year age bracket. Practical implications - Although, over the last few years, turnover within Australasian police organizations has been low, the high proportion of resignations suggests that it is possible to achieve further reductions. This finding has an important implication for police agencies currently experiencing difficulty in maintaining sufficient numbers; namely, that the overall turnover rate in police organizations should be responsive to organizational initiatives. Police jurisdictions should therefore endeavor to investigate the causes of voluntary resignation to inform strategies to minimize avoidable turnover. Originality/value - In addition to highlighting a variety of issues relevant to the consideration of turnover within policing, the present study obtained objective and reliable data to challenge the alleged problem of high turnover within Australasian policing. The benchmarking conducted here offers a detailed insight into the nature and extent of voluntary turnover within Australasian police organizations, and provides clear directions for future work in this area.
Management	Traditional approaches to understanding the ethical context of organizations often focus on ethical work climate, which 1 reflects the collective moral reasoning of organization members. However, such approaches overlook other components of the ethical environment that may influence how ethical judgments translate to ethical behavior. This study extends our understanding of the ethical context of organizations by considering how three distinct aspects of that context collective moral reasoning (ethical climate), collective moral emotion, and collective ethical efficacy interact to influence ethical behavior. Results from 117 work units support our hypotheses. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Public Administration	The study of the length of ministerial tenure has received some attention by scholars of public management in Western countries. Responding to the lack of empirical research on ministerial duration in non-Western countries, this article empirically examines the determinants of ministerial duration based on the Korean Ministerial Database from 1980 to 2008. The empirical findings are as follows. First, being a female minister decreases the probability of stepping down by 1.78 times compared to a male minister. Second, political democratization after 1987 drastically increases the probability of ministerial stepping down by 3.46 times. Third, confirmation hearings after 2005 decrease the probability of ministerial stepping down by 0.53 times. Based on these empirical findings of the analysis, we can identify distinctive characteristics of ministerial duration in Korea. We argue that as the Korean political system shifts from military or authoritarian rule to democratic rule after 1987, a single five-year presidential term may set a political environment for frequent changes of ministers to allocate political spoils.
Ethics	"The tendency is strong to take the notion of ""conflict of interests"" for granted as if it had an invariant meaning and an ethical content independent of the historical context. It is doubtful however, from an historical and sociological point of view, that many of the cases now considered as instances of ""conflicts of interests"" would also have been conceived and perceived as such in, say, the 1930s. The idea of a ""conflict of interests"" presupposes that there are indeed interests in conflict. Conversely, as long as there is a consensus among the different groups involved, they will not conceive and even less denounce a given practice as being an instance of a ""conflict of interests"". In this article we will show that the content of the discussions over conflicts of interests has changed over time in close relation with the transformations of the research system. In other words: there are social conditions for the emergence of ""conflicts of interests"". The changing meaning of the notion is assessed by analyzing the presence of the expression ""conflicts of interests"" in the magazine Science over the past century. Three different meanings emerge and their content has evolved in close link with the changing structure of the relations between the scientific community first with the State and then with industry. It moved from a situation external to the scientific community to a debate going on inside the scientific community generated by the growing relations between university and industries."
Economics	Kenya joined the ranks of sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries implementing targeted input subsidy programmes (ISPs) for inorganic fertiliser and improved seed in 2007 with the establishment of the National Accelerated Agricultural Inputs Access Programme (NAAIAP). Although several features of NAAIAP were smarter' than other ISPs in the region, some aspects were less smart'. However, the efficacy of the programme, and the relationship between its design and effectiveness, have been little studied. This article uses nationwide survey data to estimate the effects of NAAIAP participation on Kenyan smallholders' cropping patterns, incomes, and poverty status. Unlike most previous studies of ISPs, a range of panel data- and propensity score-based methods are used to estimate the effects of NAAIAP. The article then compares these estimated effects across estimators and to the effects of other ISPs in SSA, and discusses the likely links between differences in programme designs and impacts. The results are robust to the choice of estimator and suggest that, despite substantial crowding out of commercial fertiliser demand, NAAIAP had sizeable impacts on maize production and poverty severity. NAAIAP's success in targeting resource-poor farmers and implementation through vouchers redeemable at private agro-dealer shops likely contributed to its more favorable impacts than those of ISPs in Malawi and Zambia.
Information Science & Library Science	"This study on research collaboration (RC) is an attempt to estimate the degree of internationalization of academic institutions and regions. Furthermore potential influences of RC on excellence initiatives of modern universities are investigated relying on source data obtained from SCImago Institutions Rankings. A positive correlation exists between the degree of collaboration and the normalized impact. However, in contrast to output the normalized impact increase progression is non-linear and fluctuating. Differences occur regarding output volume and normalized impact at geographical region level for the leading universities. Different patterns of the Brute force distribution for each collaboration type were also observed at region level as well as at subject area level. A continuously reduced percentage of the domestic (non-collaboration) academic output is a world trend, whereas a steady increase of ""international + national"" collaboration is observed globally, however, less distinctive in Asia than in the other regions. The impact of Latin American papers originating from domestic production as well as from national collaboration remains considerably below world average values."
Political Science	Recent work on the nature of mass polarization has revealed that individuals perceive more polarization than actually exists, meaning they assume that out-party members are farther from them on the liberal-conservative continuum than they actually are according to measures of their personal preferences. But what are the consequences of this biased perception, and how do they differ from the consequences of actual polarization? In this paper, we use American National Election Studies data to estimate actual and perceived polarization at the individual level from 1972-2012. We find that the two types of polarization, while related themselves, are differentially related to other attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of normative interest. Namely, we find that perceived polarization is more strongly related to negative affective evaluations of out-parties and out-party candidates, voting, participation, trust, and efficacy than is actual polarization, which shares much weaker relationships with these constructs.
History Of Social Sciences	The concept of culture used in American anthropology has fundamentally transformed throughout the first half of the twentieth century. The changing resonance of the work of Robert H. Lowie offers revealing insights into this development. Lowie was part of the first generation of students of Franz Boas that highlighted the importance of individual variation for the study of both primitive and civilized societies. Yet, its initial resonance notwithstanding, the culture concept that prevailed in the discipline went into a different direction as the result of anthropologists' involvement in the war effort. It was advanced by the second generation of Boas' students such as Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead, who stressed the homogeneity of cultures. The contrast highlights the diversity of approaches available within anthropology in the first half of the century and the crucial impact of World War II in determining which of these possibilities became institutionalized in the decades after the war.

Political Science	Much of the current literature on compulsory voting (CV) examines its effects by simulating complete turnout We argue that these studies do not capture the full effects of CV, as there is something qualitatively different about compulsory voting rules as compared to only increasing turnout. Furthermore, CV and turnout have important, yet unexplored, interactive effects. To test this argument, we look at governments in 43 countries over the 1990-2006 period. Nine of these countries have some form of CV. We examine the effect of CV on the ideological position and range of governments, left party seat share, and the effective number of parties. We find that high turnout in the presence of CV laws spreads out the distribution of voters and leads to an increase in the effective number of parliamentary parties and a larger ideological range of governments. These results have important implications for how we study CV and its consequences for party strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Communication	"Subgroup formation within larger virtual teams can lead to biased information sharing and conflict. Given this, the present study examined how social categories (i.e., in-group vs. out-group status) and interpersonal behaviors (i.e., a teammate behaving positively vs. negatively) influenced intentions and attitudes toward subgrouping in short-term virtual teams. One hundred sixty-four participants interacted in four-person teams using a synchronous chat program. The analysis showed that, though both social categories and interpersonal behaviors affected subgrouping choices, interpersonal behaviors had a stronger effect. Additionally, there was no evidence for the ""black sheep hypothesis"" predicting that in-group members behaving negatively discourages subgrouping. Overall, this exemplified how minimal categorical cues trigger in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination in virtual teams as anticipated by social identity models. The findings also illustrated how interpersonal behaviors robustly affect virtual team dynamics as stated by social information processing theory."
Urban Studies	The research presented in this article, has the purpose of analyzing the results generated by the actions to strengthen tourism for regional development, based on the organizational dimension proposed by the Tomazzoni (2007) model. We investigated the municipalities of Prados, Sao Joao Del Rei and Tiradentes, located in the region called Campo das Verentes in the State of Minas Gerais. The investigation was based on documentary research and twelve interviews, and the data were analyzed through content analysis using Atlas it software. The results allow us to affirm that the Circuito Turistico Trilha dos Inconfidentes (CTTI) plays a leading role in the development of tourism activity in the region, exercising greater power and influence than other social actors, as an instance of tourism governance. However, there was an imbalance regarding the development of tourism actions at the municipal level, directly related to the organization of the Municipal Tourism Council of each municipality.
Information Science & Library Science	Information needs assessment is critical in developing and running relevant information services. This article explores the information needs and information-seeking patterns of the people living in communities surrounding telecentres. The research was based in four rural districts in Tanzania which have telecentres. These were Sengerema, Magu, Karagwe and Ngara districts. The research was done utilising the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) to determine how people or communities seek information concerning problem-solving, decision-making or question-answering situations. CIT was also used to determine the extent to which ICTs were used in seeking information. It was found that business and agricultural related information were the main information needs of the people in the communities involved in this study, however this information was rarely provided by the telecentres. The study further found out that face-to-face communication and the radio were the major sources of information that the respondents used. This study recommends that management of the telecentres should regularly assess user information needs in order for telecentres to have an impact on rural communities.
Cultural Studies	Arguments on the performative state often treat performance as a practice that the state forces upon its citizens in rather monologic fashion. However, this contradicts the fundamentally fluid nature of performance, always evolving, malleable and never fixed or static. Focusing on the state-sponsored televised music gala and the genre of 'urban grooves', which emerged in the context of a broader revival of cultural nationalism in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, I discuss the complex and ambivalent ways in which these spaces operated as platforms of co-optation and resistance. Performance, therefore, is an inherently risky practice that does not always prove reliable in furthering the status quo. While the state was able to discipline musicians to a certain extent, restraint was limited and musicians had the ability to shape events in their own way. The practice of performance did not only present risks to those in power, but also offered opportunities to the state to solidify its affiliation with musicians, and to frame them as natural allies or supporters of the state. Ultimately, this proves that a dialogic understanding of power and resistance is crucial in order to make sense of the convergence between politics and performance in the postcolony.
Management	Research on service brands' participation in online activities has focused largely on Internet-enabled transactions and functional interactions between the firm and the customer. Most research discussing social media for online services position it as an extension of offline customer service activities and secondary in marketing importance to branded websites. This research explores the role of social media for online service brands rather as a set of online communication channels that enable the development and nurturing of brand-consumer relationships and trust, particularly relevant for high-involvement services dealing with private consumer information. Social media are further treated as a strategic means of mitigating consumer perceptions of risk of high-involvement online services, particularly those transitioning from offline to online environments. To conclude, a prescriptive managerial process for the development, management and measurement of online service brand and customer relationship management strategies on social media is proposed.
Geography	Over the last decade, Ghana has more than tripled investment in its basic education system. Consequently, the country has made huge educational gains, primarily in providing universal access to basic education. However, many stakeholders are worried that academic performance is lagging because of dis-proportional attention to accessing basic education. Discussion of these concerns is hampered by ongoing disagreement about the true trajectory of academic performance at the basic education level and the widespread nature of students' lagging academic performance. In part, this disagreement stems from the failure of empirical studies to comprehensively examine trends in academic performance standards at the basic education level by concurrently considering a geographical and longitudinal perspective. Thus, this study examines the spatio-temporal trends of academic performance at the junior high school level since 2009 by using multilevel growth curve modeling, spatial statistics, and district-level longitudinal data. Results reveal 3 statistically distinct trajectories of academic performance: erratic, accelerating, and decelerating changes. Results also show that rural-urban gaps explain 31% of the performance trajectories, a trend which is expected to persist in the long term. In addition, we find extreme variations in academic performance within rural areas. Given the varying trajectories and geographical variability in academic performance, we suggest a localized approach to addressing challenges of low academic achievement at the basic education level in Ghana.

Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	"Objective. To study the AIDS epidemic in Brazil's border areas, from the spatial and temporal perspective. Methods. This was an ecological study in which the cases of AIDS reported to the Ministry of Health of Brazil from 1990-2003 were grouped according to ""hunger areas"" as defined by Josue de Castro in the 1940s and according to 19 cultural subregions. Spatial assessment was based on incidence rates for border municipalities; temporal assessment considered the absolute number of cases occurring quarterly from 1990-2003 in each of the hunger areas studied (Extreme South, Midwest, and Amazon). Results. During the study period, 7 973 cases of AIDS were reported from the Brazilian border areas: 648 in the Amazon area, 1 579 in the Midwest, and 5 746 in the Extreme South (populations of 668 098, 895 489, and 2 769 361, respectively). The subregions with the highest AIDS incidence rates in each of the three border areas were those near triple-borders, between more than two Latin American countries. Sexual transmission was predominant, with heterosexual transmission being the most frequent, followed by transmission by male homosexuality. These two categories accounted for 87.2% of the cases reported. The estimates of the trend parameter in the temporal analysis were 0.53 (P < 0.0001), 0.83 (P < 0.0001), and 3.47 (P < 0.0001), respectively, for the Amazon, Midwest, and Extreme South areas. Conclusion. The improvement of health care services along Brazil's borders may be a strategy for territorial integration and for dealing with the AIDS epidemic, as long as social, economic, and cultural differences are taken into account."
Education & Educational Research	Malaika Favorite's Furious Flower Poetry Quilt (2004) is an acrylic painting that depicts 24 portraits of leading poets of the African Diaspora. Commissioned by Dr Joanne Gabbin, English professor and director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, the painting is part of a larger programme of poetry education. The painting's interweaving of the portraits with fragments from the poets' writing functions to create an interactive visual-textual body of poets and poetry, a collection which has been taught at all levels of education from primary school to university. Its quilt structure pays homage to the historic role of women in preserving history and memory. The painting also serves to construct a pan-African identity and collective memory about slavery, African American history and empowerment.
Criminology & Penology	Using data from the National Trajectory Project, we compared 50 individuals found Not Criminally Responsible on account of Mental Disorder (NCRMD) for sexual offences with 50 age- and gender-matched individuals found NCRMD for nonsexually violent offences. We also described the concurrent offenses, the symptoms at the time of the offense and the characteristics of the victims of offenders found NCRMD for sexual offences. Persons found NCRMD for sexual offences were less likely to be employed and were significantly younger at time of first psychiatric contact, but did not differ in other sociodemographic characteristics, other aspects of their psychiatric histories or in criminal history. Despite no differences in recidivism and no differences in behaviours between Review Board hearings when adjusting for unequal time at risk, persons found NCRMD for sexual offences had longer tenures under a Review Board mandate than persons found NCRMD for nonsexually violent offences. Given the many similarities between the two groups, this finding suggests that Review Boards may be unnecessarily conservative in how they manage sexual offenders.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Objective: Support groups are often arranged for siblings of children with disabilities to prevent psychological maladjustment. This study describes how children express emotions in support groups and how group leaders and other children respond. Method: Conversations in 17 group sessions for siblings aged 11 to 16 were coded with VR-CODES to report frequency of emotional expressions and responses. Results: Children expressed negative emotion during group sessions (n = 235), 59% as cues and 41% concerns. The immediate response was in 98% of the instances from the group leader. 38% of the responses focused on emotion, cognition or behavior. Conclusion: Children express emotions, but seldom respond immediately to others' emotional expressions in support groups. Group leaders should attend to emotion, cognition and behavior more frequently. Practice implications: Group leaders may better fulfill the support potential of support groups through explicitly stating the role of participants, and by exploring emotional aspects.

History	This article examines the life and ideas of Josef Schmidlin, the founder of Catholic missionary science' and the most influential German Catholic missionary theorist of the first half of the twentieth century. An admirer of the German Protestant missionary theologian Gustav Warneck, Schmidlin often appears in the historiography as a forerunner of the Protestant-Catholic ecumenical collaboration that emerged after the Second World War. Yet a close examination of his writing reveals a vigorous critic of Protestantism and the Protestant ecumenical movement. A sceptic of transnational missionary organizations, he remained a firm supporter of the German nation and imperial project. This article gestures towards both the continuities and the discontinuities between the early attempts at fostering confessional cooperation between Protestants and Catholics and the later iterations. It also examines how nineteenth-century entanglements between missions and empire shaped the ideas of Catholic missionary theory during the interwar years.
Business	This paper assesses university efficiency from a multidimensional perspective. First, the study scrutinizes universities using an efficiency measure that incorporates knowledge transfer outputs in the objective function. Second, a cluster analysis complements the efficiency model giving a more comprehensive image of universities' performance. The empirical application considers the Spanish higher education system during 2006-2009. The results point to the presence of heterogeneous orientations among Spanish universities and that universities integrate knowledge transfer in their operations at different intensities. The findings reveal that regional factors related to technological development and entrepreneurial culture strongly influence universities' efficiency and their involvement in knowledge transfer activities. As regards knowledge transfer across Spanish universities, results tend to give ammunition to the argument that effective support policies should have the capacity to be customized to fit the profile of the targeted universities and regions.

Business	The authors develop a new typology of truthful but misleading advertising and labeling claims. Although several typologies of deceptive or misleading advertising appear in the literature, the authors' typology relies on legal cases as well as a diverse set of psychological theories to provide a richer and more comprehensive understanding of why consumers are likely to be misled by a particular type of deception. The goal is to generate a better appreciation of how consumers process various types of potentially misleading information and to explore implications for further research.
Environmental Studies	In a time of economic crisis the need to adopt energy conservation practices comes to the fore. It is helpful to evaluate the role of young people as both consumers and potential agents of change bridging the gap between school and family to encourage lower household energy consumption. Based on two surveys of parents and students of a secondary school in Lisbon, plus in-depth interviews with parents, this article analyzes the complexity of this challenge, highlighting adults' perceptions of their children's contribution to energy saving. Results show that parents see young people as major energy consumers. Young people's engagement with electronic equipment as essential components of their lifestyles and their belief in technology as a solution to energy problems thwart them from being promoters of energy saving. In this context of scarcity, parents try to protect their children's well-being and opportunities in life by accepting their children's unrestricted energy use.
Information Science & Library Science	"We investigated whether applicants or recipients of research productivity fellowships of the main research financing agency in Brazil (CNPq) would consider the most ""important products and indicators"" of scientific/academic activity those also considered the least susceptible. We hypothesized that perception of susceptibility and importance of productivity indicators would vary according to the fellowship level of the grantees. Seven hundred and two scientists, being 79 non-grantees and 623 recipients of research productivity fellowships in the area of biosciences participated in the study. The scientists were requested to score the importance of a series of indicators (i.e., total number of published articles, number of articles as first author, number of articles as last/corresponding author, H-index, books and others, totalizing 39 variables) using a Likert scale. After completing the evaluation of the symbolic importance of all indicators, the scientists scored the ""susceptibility"" of the same indicators. The most important products and indicators of productivity were also those considered the least susceptible. Local, national and international prizes, publications or grants were increasingly perceived as more important and less susceptible. Moreover, the symbolic magnitude of susceptibility and importance of the elements (indicators) of the curriculum varied according to the productivity fellowship level of the grantee and gender. Despite the observed differences, a consensus of the most important and least susceptible products and indicators could be established. Ultimate individual responsibility and international projection are common characteristics of the most important and least susceptible indicators of scientific productivity."
Substance Abuse	Over 5 million adults in the United States have a co-occurring substance use disorder and serious psychological distress. Mutual aid (self-help) can usefully complement treatment, but people with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders often encounter a lack of empathy and acceptance in traditional mutual aid groups. Double Trouble in Recovery (DTR) is a dual focus fellowship whose mission is to bring the benefits of mutual aid to persons recovering from co-occurring disorders. An evaluation of DTR was conducted by interviewing 310 persons attending 24 DTR meetings in New York City (NYC) in 1998 and following them up for 2 years, in 1999 and 2000. The evaluation produced 13 articles in 12 peer-reviewed journals, the main results of which are summarized here. The sample's characteristics were as follows: mean age, 40 years; women, 28%; black, 59%; white, 25%; Hispanic, 14%; never married, 63%; live in supported community residence, 53%; high school graduate or GED, 60%; arrested as adult, 63%; diagnoses of: schizophrenia, 39%; major depression, 21%; or bipolar disorder, 20%; currently prescribed psychiatric medication, 92%; primary substance used, current or past: cocaine/crack, 42%; alcohol 34%; or heroin, 11%. Overall, the findings indicate that DTR participation has both direct and indirect effects on several important components of recovery: drug/alcohol abstinence, psychiatric medication adherence, self-efficacy for recovery, and quality of life. The study also identified several common therapeutic factors (e.g., internal motivation and social support) and unique mutual aid processes (helper-therapy and reciprocal learning) that mediate the influence of DTR participation on recovery. For clinicians, these results underline the importance of fostering stable affiliation with specialized dual focus 12-step groups for their patients with co-occurring disorders, as part of a comprehensive recovery-oriented treatment approach.
Communication	Social media users are able to read, share, and discuss news online with other people coming from diverse contexts in their lives, including family members, co-workers, and friends. Past research has indicated that context collapse occurs when people must imagine and negotiate interacting with a large and diverse online audience. Using survey data from 771 US Internet users, we find that more context collapse in people's Facebook friends is positively related to both sharing and reading news. Furthermore, reading news on Facebook mediates the relationship between context collapse and news sharing. Finally, privacy management moderates the relationship between reading and sharing news on Facebook, where people who are more open in their privacy management practices share more news.
Communication	"This essay explores the relationship between epideictic discourse and war through the analysis of George W. Bush's August 20, 2005, address at the Naval Air Station near San Diego, ostensibly to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Allied victory over Japan. The case also serves as an exemplar for how Bush routinely interwove epideictic appeals with collective memories of World War II in order to promote the Iraq war and deflect criticism of his policies there. Bush praised the greatest generation and linked it to the current generation; blamed and dehumanized enemies of the past and present; advocated for war based on ""lessons"" from the past; and reinforced a shared identity to instill both obligation and confidence."
Gerontology	Primary and secondary care services are charged with failing to adequately detect and treat mental disorder in older adults due to the 'understandability phenomenon'; the belief that mental disorder in old age is inevitable and therefore not worthy of intervention. Quantitative data appear to support this hypothesis but lack the explanatory power of detailed accounts. Nine general practitioners (GPs) participated in group interviews about their assessment and treatment of older patients, and their expectations and experience of referral to secondary care. Resulting transcripts were subject to Thematic Analysis. Respondents recognised the unique features of these clients, and their impact on the detailed, recursive processes of assessment, clinical decision-making and intervention. GPs described confidence in managing most cases of mental disorder, describing the role of secondary care as one of consultancy in extreme or unusual cases. GPs did view mental disorder as commonly originating in adverse circumstances, and queried the validity of pharmacological or psychological interventions in these cases. They did not, however, equate understandability with acceptability, and called for social interventions to be integrated with health-care interventions to tackle the cause of mental disorder in older adults. At a wider level, findings highlight the discrepancy between assumptions about GP attitudes and actions, and their own accounts. At a local level, findings will assist in focusing secondary care service development where need is perceived, into consultancy and training.
Nursing	The following case study is presented to highlight the importance of consistency in identifying and treating oppositional defiant disorder in a pediatric patient with a life-threatening medical illness. A pediatric transplant patient's oppositional behaviors are described, as well as the educational behavioral training program provided to the patient's caregivers and medical staff. As a result of the training, the patient engaged in less oppositional behavior, was more cooperative and pleasant with staff, and was more compliant with her treatment. Subjective reports from caregivers indicated that the training with its emphasis on consistency effectively reduced the patient's symptoms and enhanced the caregivers' ability to care for the patient.

Transportation	This paper suggests using a proportional hazard model to predict personal income, for the purpose of imputing missing income data in household travel surveys. The model has a hazard function that comprises two multiplicative components: (1) a non-parametric baseline hazard function that is dependent only on the income level and (2) a function that is dependent only on the other personal attributes of the survey respondents (excluding income). To estimate and validate the model, data is drawn from a travel characteristics survey conducted in Hong Kong in year 2001. The model is found to have a much higher accuracy when compared with a conventional ordered probit model based on the assumption that the logarithm of income is normally distributed.
International Relations	I analyze a model of war expansion in the shadow of international law, where neutrality regimes emerge as equilibria in which only aggressive states are expected to violate the law. By sorting belligerents according to their ambitions (restrained or aggressive), neutrality regimes can help resolve third-party uncertainty over the desirability of balancing. Punishment for violations of the law emerges in equilibrium from self-interested power calculations absent any principled legal commitment. The model shows that (a) neutrality regimes can be effective not despite but because of inconsistent compliance; (b) strong third parties are uniquely prone to failures to balance under neutrality regimes; and (c) ratification of neutrality regimes can be facilitated by mutual and severe mistrust. Neutrality regimes need not be epiphenomenal to power politics; rather, they can support balance-of-power systems.
Law	The issues of State and diplomatic immunity in cases involving persons employed by foreign States in embassies or consulates or engaged directly by diplomats remain controversial. The focus of this article is on recent developments in European law, in particular under the European Convention on Human Rights, the Brussels I Regulation and the Charter of the European Union, the effect of which has been to enhance the rights of employees of foreign States. Analysis is also made of the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property and the current domestic practice of States with the aim of identifying the present international law standard on State immunity and embassy and consular employment. Employees of diplomats, however, remain inadequately protected and this article considers possible strategies for improving their position.
Urban Studies	This study seeks to investigate how rural migrants from less developed areas survive the hurdles of starting businesses in the host region in China from the perspective of mixed embeddedness. Based on 40 interviews via a snowballing survey strategy in Yuhuan City, Zhejiang Province, it is shown that rural migrant workers (RMWs) create their own enterprises through social and institutional embeddedness. Rural migrants can benefit from social embeddedness, particularly by developing relationships with local entrepreneurs and managers in local firms and other rural migrant entrepreneurs (RMEs) in their entrepreneurial activities. Further, it is also important for RMEs to embed institutionally in the host region in various ways. RMEs have been inspired by the local entrepreneurial tradition and culture of Yuhuan. In addition, the policies of both the host region and RMEs' hometowns have impacts on their entrepreneurial activities. Interestingly, RMEs can improve their institutional embeddedness by participating in the joint public governance on RMWs initiated by the hometown government.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Welfare State and Development The relations between the welfare state and development are frequently portrayed as problematic and even dilemmatic. For example, it is claimed that the welfare state is only possible in developed countries, or that typical welfare state redistribution is necessarily accompanied by weaker economic growth. The main purpose of this article is to systematize the arguments and evidence against these assumptions, featuring the functionality of the welfare state for development in both economic and non-economic terms.
International Relations	"China""s growing power and influence raise important and inescapable questions for countries and societies around the world, not least for Europe. A rising China offers opportunities for greater cooperation, both bilaterally and in the context of old and new multilateral institutions, yet also carries inherent risks for the European Union (EU), not least in the way in which it may make it (even) more difficult to manage the relations with other global powers while also maintaining unity among EU member states. This special issue examines Europe""s response to the steady and dramatic rise of China over the past two decades. In particular, it explores the challenges as well as the many instances of engagement that define their relations today across a number of policy areas, including economic, diplomatic, and security relations. The contributions to this special issue demonstrate the varied, multi-faceted and to some extent contradictory nature of EU-China relations. The two sides are in an ever-closer economic embrace, yet they remain distant and occasionally antagonistic with respect to security concerns or normative discourses."
History Of Social Sciences	Corporativist urbanism, in which Italian Rationalist architects adapted modernist design principles to the scales of urban and regional planning, represented an attempt to reshape and restructure Italian society through the comprehensive transformation of the built environment. Corporativist urbanism synthesized the empirical methods and programmatic concerns endorsed by the Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (International Congress of Modern Architecture or CIAM) with the rhetorical imperatives of the fascist regime in an attempt to rationalize industrial and agricultural production processes, promote hygienic and efficient living standards and instill in the citizenry a collective and militant mass identity in service to the fascist state. The primary vehicle for the advocates of corporativist urbanism was Quadrante, a 'journal of battle' that championed modern architecture and urbanism as integral components of the fascist state. Founded in May 1933 by Italy's leading Rationalist architects (as well as artists, critics, engineers and significant patrons of modern architecture), Quadrante pressed the case for an urbanism that would support the fascist regime's policies and represent its values. Quadrante's editors and contributors included Italy's most important urban planners, and all of the country's delegates to CIAM. Compared with the modern movement worldwide, the experience of Italian architects is both exemplary and exceptional: exemplary in the vital importance urbanism held for architecture (and regional planning held for urban planning), but exceptional in the centrality of fascist rhetoric to their theorization of design at every scale. The Rationalists recognized an inherent affinity between the political hierarchies and economic order of corporativist fascism and the city planning strategies of CIAM, in which the international organization turned from the question of modern architecture to a concern with urbanism in order to reform society by reordering the metropolis. This essay examines the Quadrante circle's theoretical writings on corporativist urbanism in the context of their urban planning proposals in order to understand how CIAM's principles were transformed by the organization's Italian members and how corporative fascism was shaped by designers.
Business	Demographic changes' occurring in developed countries has meant that older consumers are becoming an increasingly important consumer segment that retailers need to pay particular attention to. It is essential that their specific needs within the food and other service sectors are met, as food plays an important role in their social well-being. Very little research has focused upon the extent to which retailers meet their demands and particular needs. The aim of this study, as part of a wider study on older consumers, is to address this lack of information by examining the level of awareness held by food retail management as to the needs of older consumers (60+ years old) and the problems that they encounter while shopping. Qualitative data were collected using face-to-face interviews with retail managers (n = 5) from food retailers in Northern Ireland. These were analysed according to Gillham's content analysis guide. Food retailers stated they were aware of the issues older consumers face and recognize their importance as a growing consumer segment; however, there would appear to be relatively little actual consideration/evidence of them meeting their needs. All interviewees expressed an interest in improving the food shopping experiences of older consumers, and were keen to make an increased effort towards this segment of the population, but these were often not put into practice. In order to overcome the problems faced by older consumers and strengthen the food shopping experience for this age group, it is suggested that retail management make practical changes to improve in-store facilities, increase affordability of food products and home delivery services, and enhance customer communication.
Economics	This paper shows that the design of education policy involves a potential conflict between welfare and social mobility. We consider a setting in which social mobility is maximized under the least elitist public education system, whereas welfare maximization calls for the most elitist system. We show that when private education is available, the degree of elitism that maximizes social mobility increases, while the welfare-maximizing degree of elitism decreases. The ranking between the welfare- and mobility-maximizing degrees of elitism may even be reversed. Utilitarian welfare is always higher when private supplementary education is available, but social mobility may be reduced.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Over the past 7 years we have investigated how craft skills may be elicited and embodied in multimedia learning resources. This led to an understanding of the principles of eliciting and transmitting such knowledge ( Wood, 2006). The most recent project has developed and evaluated a practical system for designers who wish to undertake this work. By engaging with master craftsmen, expert learners and novices to create and use a web-based learning resource it was found that well-motivated learners, working in physical isolation but supported by an online community, could acquire difficult new skills and use them in creative ways. The paper also outlines key theory from the preceding research to explain how this is achieved. It indicates how the focus of the research has moved from the production of highly structured conventional multimedia materials to the use of web 2.0 resources that invite participation and exchange by learners.
Social Issues	"Education in South Africa from 1961 to 2011: Between two paradigms and elusive ideals This article forms part of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe. It presents an overview of events and debates in education provision in South Africa during the period under review. The article argues that education between 1961 and 2011 needs to be understood against the backdrop of what happened in the country even before 1961. It therefore lists and briefly discusses a number of pre-1961 historical events pertinent to education. Before 1994, and from 1961 onward in particular education in South Africa was dominated by the separate but equal paradigm, also espousing the principle of differentiated education to accommodate the learning needs of learners and the needs of the country. The South Africa Act of 1909 set the tone for the exclusion of the so-called non-Whites from political and other processes. It allocated higher education to the Union Government and all other education to the four provincial governments. This period was characterised among others by the creation of advisory councils for non-White education and various levels of education institutions for non-Whites. Various investigations to explore possibilities regarding the provision of education for non-Whites like the Eiselen Commission were commissioned. In 1948 the National Party assumed power and adopted the apartheid policy (separate development). The Bantu Education Act was promulgated soon after and it came to epitomise all that was objectionable about the separate but equal policy: unequal spending on children of different races and a curriculum designed to educate Black children for second class citizen status. It unleashed opposition to apartheid education that was not to stop before 1994. Separate educational laws for the education of Indians and Coloureds were introduced in the 1960s and the Education and Training Act was promulgated in the 1970s to regulate the education of all Black people inside ""South Africa"" and outside it in the self-governing territories that had been formed by that time. In 1994 the ANC took over political power and immediately gave expression to the Freedom Charter notion that the doors of learning shall be opened to all. The ANC espoused what can be called a human rights (transformative or freedom) education paradigm built on the pillars of equality, access, redress, non-racialism, non-sexism and quality. It transformed the education system and created only one national education department with nine provincial departments and only two types of schools - public and independent schools. The ANC introduced sweeping legislative and policy changes and changed the organisation, funding and governance of schools. Compulsory school attendance for all children was introduced and only one national school-end examination was put in place. The article argues that neither the separate but equal nor the human rights paradigm achieved their ideals. This conclusion is reached by analysing the performance of the system, the training of teachers, the curriculum, the cultural and religious aspects of schooling, the role that unions play in education and the funding of education. It further concludes that too many schools remain dysfunctional and that many children do not yet have access to quality education despite the fact that participation in education has improved dramatically. The unique role of unions in South African governance and schooling is examined and their alleged disruptive rule regarding the management and governance of education is explored. The main claim of the article is that participation in education has increased but that the performance of the system has not improved significantly. Previous gaps and inequalities seem to have remained and may even have widened. The ideals pursued by the two paradigms in question remain elusive. There are, however a number of keys that can be used to unlock the potential of the education system so that it may contribute its share to the wellbeing of the citizens of the country and to the welfare and development of the country as a whole."
Cultural Studies	"Capital Art Studio is the oldest photographic studio in Zanzibar today, and is unique in having survived the revolution of 1964. This essay reflects on the practices of remembrance performed by father and son, Ranchhod and Rohit Oza, in the studio since its inception in 1930. It does so by attending to the double nature of the photograph-simultaneously two-dimensional image and three-dimensional thing""-and its paradoxical inscription of the changing times in Zanzibar. Focusing on the studio's image-making practices and their material manifestations, the essay reflects on its presentation of competing visions of vernacular modernity and their states of ruination."
Urban Studies	The Red/Blue dichotomy describing presidential elections, while criticized, is ubiquitous: Red states vote Republican, Blue states Democratic. Locally, suburban and rural counties are often Red, urban counties Blue. This overgeneralization misses the Republican share of urban centers. This study analyzes the 2000-2012 presidential elections in core counties of metropolitan areas with populations over 250,000. Possible explanations for urban election outcomes cover three theoretical groupings: sociodemographics, culture, and economics. Several prominent explanatory variables from each are compared. Changes from 2000-2004 to 2008-2012 are highlighted given the 2008 economic crash and President Obama's race and urban identity, which permitted him to cut President Bush's core county share in half. Regression analyses find that sociodemographic and cultural features account for most variation for all elections, while economic indicators add little explanatory power. In contrast to conventional thinking, economics mattered most in 2004, culture increased in importance in 2008-2012, and urban foreclosures positively influenced McCain in 2008.
Communication	In 2012, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN) published a series of articles criticising Swedish national level gymnastics for being abusive. This text analyses the subsequent debate by identifying the discursive and rhetorical resources used by the involved parties. The analysis shows how the parties negotiate accountability, manage dilemmas of stake and what the possible social consequences of these are. Five narratives are singled out in the debate: the counter narrative, the victim narrative, the defence-speech narrative, the expert narrative and the 'not-us-narrative'. In these narratives, the involved parties used rhetorical resources to account for reality. Hence, the gymnastics community, the research community, individuals and journalists are all portrayed as actors co-producing a social problem.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	The impact of digitalization of health services has been profound and is expected to be even more profound in the future. It is important to evaluate whether digital health services contribute to health system goals in an optimal way. This should be done at the level of the service, not the 'digital transformation'. Decisions to adopt new digital health services, at different levels of the health care system, are ideally based on evidence regarding their performance in light of health system goals. In order to evaluate this, a broad perspective should be taken in evaluations of digital health services. Attainment of the broad health system goals, including quality, efficiency and equity, are objectives against which to judge new digital health services. These goals in a broad sense are unaltered by the process of digitalization. Governance should be designed and tailored in such a way to capture all relevant changes in an adequate way. When evaluating digital health services many specific aspects need to be considered. Like for other innovations and (new) technologies, such promises may or may not materialize and potential benefits may also be accompanied by unintended and/or negative (side) effects in the short or long term. Hence, the introduction, implementation, use and funding of digital health technologies should be carefully evaluated and monitored. Governments should play a more active role in the further optimization both of the process of decision making (both at the central and decentral level) and the related outcomes. They need to find a balance between centralized and decentralized activity. Moreover, the broader preparation of the health care system to be able to deal with digitalization, from education, through financial and regulatory preconditions, to implementation of monitoring systems to monitor its effects on health system performance remains important.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This manuscript discusses two extant theories that are pertinent to retaining new graduate nurses in practice and applies the new theory of reciprocal role modelling to them. Transition shock was first postulated by Boychuk Duchscher, who theorised that the real life world of clinical practice was so far removed from a nurse's educational preparation in College or University that it caused the attrition of some nurses from the profession. In addition, Chambliss described the process of routinisation into hospital life and nursing work in his book Beyond caring, which was the result of 15 years of ethnographic observation in a hospital. Some nurses never become routinised to nurses' work. Both of these theories support the grounded theory of reciprocal role modelling, that describes how new graduate nurses are mentored by experienced practice nurses (EPNs) into general practice in New Zealand. Unexpectedly new graduate nurses become role models to the EPNs showing them how to access information and continuing professional development material using modern technology. Acknowledging transition shock and the concept of routinisation and providing an environment in health-care organisations where reciprocal role modelling can occur, may result in the retention of younger nurses in the workforce.
Demography	"Chile is among the countries of Latin America that have seen accelerated and intense demographic transitions of aging and urbanization in the last decades. This paper presents the main findings of the research ""Quality of Life of older adults in the urban habitat: the case study of Valparaiso"" (Fondecyt 106117), conducted in Valparaiso (Chile) between 2006 and 2009, and its successive actualizations (2011-2013). Based on empirical evidence obtained by combining quantitative and qualitative methods, the paper analyses how certain conditions of the urban habitat impact upon the quality of life of the older age group. Given to the Valparaiso's elevated aging index, its social structure, unique topography and architectural configuration, the city is a case study of special interest."
Ethnic Studies	The article discusses President Barack Obama's troubling foreign policy as it relates to Africa and the Arab Spring; the apparent disinterest amongst African Americans in U.S. military intervention in Libya and unrest in Mali; and the need for building new, internationally focused Black movements in the United States as we look to and beyond the 2012 presidential election.
Cultural Studies	Progressive political movements and activists are not the only ones appropriating Web 2.0 as a way to construct independent public spaces and voice counter-hegemonic discourses. By studying (post-) fascist movements, it will be shown that the internet also gives rise to anti-public spaces, voicing hatred and essentialist discourses. In this article, discourses of hate produced by North Belgian (post-) fascist movements and activists will be analysed. Theoretically the analysis is informed by radical pluralism and the limits of freedom of speech in a strong democracy. The cases presented challenge the limits of freedom of speech and of radical pluralism, and bring us to question whether being a racist is a democratic right, whether freedom of speech includes opinions and views that challenge basic democratic values.
Substance Abuse	The impact of a parent's incarceration and adolescents' emotional health on their substance abuse and delinquency is described for a group of at-risk 10- to 14-year-old adolescents. Data were drawn from a two-wave longitudinal study from the federally funded Children at Risk program, ongoing in five states from 1993 to 1997. Results point to a significant role played by a parent's incarceration in at-risk adolescents' problem behaviors but no mediating role played by the adolescents' emotional health. Adolescents' self-reports suggest that emotional health is associated with comparatively few problem behaviors, and associations that were observed were stronger for females than for males. The results call for further studies specifying models of the social mechanism that leads from parents' incarceration to children's problem behaviors.
Women'S Studies	This study analyzed the portrayal of dating violence in teen magazines published in the United States. Such an investigation is important because previous research indicates that dating violence is a serious problem facing adolescents, teen magazines overemphasize the importance of romantic relationships, and teens who read this genre frequently or for education/advice are especially susceptible to its messages. Results indicated that although teen magazines do frame dating violence as a cultural problem, they are much more likely to utilize an individual frame that emphasizes the victim. Results were discussed as they apply to the responsibilities of professionals working with adolescents.
Cultural Studies	Following the increasing attention paid to popular music in heritage discourses, this article explores how the popular music culture from the 1960s is remembered in Europe. I discuss the role of heritage organizations, media and the cultural policy of the EU in the construction of a popular music heritage of this period. Furthermore, I examine the ways in which attachments to local, national and European identities are negotiated. To this end, I draw upon interviews with representatives of museums, websites and archives. The article reveals a recurring tension between transnational and local experiences of the 1960s. It is found that media and heritage institutions like museums and archives predominantly have a national and local orientation, although narratives with a European vantage point are now emerging on the internet.
Social Issues	"Democratisation and Standardisation - conflicting objectives for indigenous languages? At first blush, the two concepts, democratisation and standardisation, seem to be in conflict lithe objectives underlying the processes they describe are compared, in particular if they are applied to the field of language planning and politics, and especially within the context of the colonial history of Africa and further afield. It is in the nature of standardisation not to tolerate much variety, even in the language to be standardised (especially in the formal registers). The functional requirements of stylistic, sociolectal or geolectal variants in a language community, on the other hand, reflect a wide spectrum of varieties in a given language. Underlying the need for standardisation is the requirement for communication in the form of a unitary code (i.e. a language) which is understood and used by as many members of the community as possible, necessarily and usually in formal contexts. However, a standardised language, like all others, also has need of neutral and informal registers for which the appropriate vocabulary should be available. Such vocabulary originates in everyday speech, while ""formal"" terminology aimed at the higher functions of language is often compiled by bodies such as language commissions. The standardisation of language is often the result of a political process, which is a corollary of conquest, colonialism, or (sometimes) democratic change. A standard language, once established, normally possesses a self-perpetuating force - those who have acquired it, do not easily relinquish the concomitant social and political power associated with it. This applies in particular to non-mother-tongue speakers of the standard language, who benefit from the social status and increased access to knowledge associated with it. The result is, predictably, discrimination on the basis of proficiency in the standard, and societal imbalances. Arguments in defence of the selection of a non-indigenous standard are the purportedly equal distribution of disadvantage, as well as the possible unifying force of such a medium. To understand the task facing those who wish to standardise an indigenous language, the four phases traditionally identified by Haugen could be recalled, le. selection (macro and micro), codification, acceptance and cultivation (elaboration of functions). This is possibly another reason why already established colonial languages seemed to be an attractive choice at the outset when considering the adoption of an indigenous language for the purposes of standardisation. However, when the intellectual and economic benefits of linguistic democracy are considered, the investment in the enhancement of access to knowledge for entire language communities is well spent. The advantages for the development of human capital in the short and long term for such communities have been proven in countless scientific studies. A common disincentive is the purported ""unsuitability"" of indigenous languages for use in technical and scientific contexts. However, similar techniques for the creation of terminology are applied by all languages where elaboration of functions takes place, i.e. relexification, use of international cognates, conceptual translation (calquing), the use of informal vocabulary in specialised applications, neologisms, etcetera. Examples of attempts at standardisation or restandardisation of nonstandard varieties, such as in Norway and Albania can be adduced. In Norway, Nynorsk was created to replace Bokmal, but there was a clear differentiation by the speakers between spoken and written requirements, so that the written language gravitated to Bokmal, and the spoken language to Nynorsk. In Albania, where Standard Albanian was based on Tosc, attempts were made at incorporating elements of North Albanian (Gegh) into the standard for reasons of 'justice"". However, it foundered as a result of resistance from intellectuals on the basis that ""justice"" in standardisation was ""impossible"". Some lessons from Norway, and also the Magreb (which is subsequently discussed), are that varieties in both Norwegian and Arabic are closely linked to rules of contextuality and register; and that, although there is a greater need for uniformity as regards the form of written standard, the written form of informally used items needs to be standardised as well, albeit in a different way Finally, the use of the Internet as agent for both standardisation and democratisation is briefly investigated. It is apparent that informal standardisation (through codification) is taking place through the production of increased volumes of texts by common users. The production of electronic texts leads to the compilation of corpora, and standardisation of the lexicon takes place on the basis of frequency counts and the use of concordances by NGO's. Some examples of such standardisation (official and unofficial) in Africa are provided. The conclusions drawn from the overview are that: (a) Democratisation and standardisation do not have to represent conflicting objectives for indigenous languages in Africa; (b) Users of language determine the form that is standardised in the end; and (c) Speakers of African languages have the ability to determine not only which language(s) they prefer to use for which purpose, but also the form of such languages."
International Relations	We investigate the role of international reputation in alliance politics by developing a signaling theory linking past alliance violations with the formation of future alliance commitments. In our theory, past violations Are useful signals of future alliance reliability conditional on whether they effectively separate reliable from unreliable alliance partners. It follows that states evaluating potential alliance partners will interpret past violations in their context when deciding to enter a new alliance, attaching less weight to violations in harder times, when many states are defaulting on their alliance commitments together, and more weight to violations in easier times, when fewer states are defaulting on their alliances. We test our theory and find that states are empirically more likely to form new alliances with states that violated in harder times compared to states that violated in easier times. The results have important implications for how scholars understand and estimate the impact of international reputation.
Political Science	"Under what conditions do individuals withdraw support from dominant parties in nondemocratic regimes? Employing an original panel survey, we measure the same individuals"" support for Russia""s dominant party first at the peak of its dominance in 2008 and again shortly after it suffered a cascading defection of regime supporters in 2011-12. This allows us uniquely to explore the microfoundations of theories of regime defection cascades, generally supporting the argument that they involve complex informational as well as reputational processes. Accordingly, we find that early and eager movers in such a cascade tend to come from less socially vulnerable segments of the population, to have greater need to rely on other people for interpreting events, to believe the regime has lower levels of popular support, and to come from more heterogeneous communities. We find little role for mass media (including social media) or democratizing zeal in driving Russia""s regime defection cascade."
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This exploratory study examines corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the lodging industry by measuring the contributions to communities made by lodging properties throughout the United States. This work is significant for two reasons: (a) It attempts to develop a theoretical foundation for CSR within the U. S. lodging industry; (b) it signifies one of the first attempts to quantify one component of CSR, corporate giving, within the U.S. lodging industry. A random sample of lodging properties in the United States was surveyed, and they were asked to report their various contributions to community. Although a limited response prevented generalizability, based on 421 responding properties, regression analysis suggested that the industry made various contributions worth more than $815 million or 3.6% of total industry profits in 2005. The results also showed that a number of structural variables affected the quantified social component of CSR among lodging properties as well as the existence of CSR written policies, processes, and principles.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The Bayesian estimation framework has specific benefits that can aid in the estimation of mixture models. Previous research has shown that the use of priors to capture (un)certainty in latent class sizes has the potential to greatly improve estimation accuracy of a mixture model. These priors can be beneficial in mixture modeling, but proper specification is key. A sensitivity analysis of priors is essential to understand the impact of the prior on the latent classes, whether diffuse or informed priors are implemented. We illustrate a full sensitivity analysis on Dirichlet priors for the class proportions of a latent growth mixture model. We show that substantive results can (drastically) shift as the prior setting is modified, even if only slightly. Math assessment data were used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten class. We conclude with a discussion about final model interpretations when estimates are highly influenced by prior settings.
Industrial Relations & Labor	As the efficacy of the neoliberal model is now in question this is an appropriate moment to consider what kind of regional development and for whom?', or, as the authors interpret it, what kind of development model would be inclusive and economically and socially sustainable. Current indicators of regional performance are based on growth alone, overlook distribution and so misrepresent the performance of regions in terms of social well-being. An alternative, more inclusive measure of regional development and a gender sensitive variant are calculated for UK regions. On these measures London falls from the top ranked region to a middle rank on the regional development indicator and on the gender sensitive variant falls to the lowest position, arguably better reflecting the experience of life in this region. Optimistically, use of these measures would lead to more inclusive models of development that would render the more contentious social, redistributive policies less necessary.
Social Issues	Recent archival research has uncovered material that usefully explains why the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was required to remain in China for so long, despite assenting to the Six Propositions. However, the context in Rome, existing narrative evidence, and aspects of the archival evidence make it more likely than not that the Holy Office had a role in his silencing. Proposition 4 advocated monogenism, whereas Teilhard was developing a monophyletic understanding of human origins, which is consistent with recent attempts to situate Adam and Eve within an evolutionary account of these. The content of Proposition 4 exceeded existing magisterial teaching and requiring Teilhard's subscription to it suppressed legitimate theological debate.
Ethnic Studies	"In this article, we apply developments from the affective turn-in particular, the concept of assemblages-to understand the relationship between race, affect, and emotions. We use the example of a Black CEO unsuccessfully hailing a taxi to show how race materializes with different intensities in specific settings, and how this operates in assemblage theory. We show that the emotion of ""fear"" plays a particularly important role in conditioning the way that race materializes with precise capacities in this specific encounter. In this way, race emerges as a particular version of race through the relational processes at work among the other elements of the assemblage, and the affects that emerge in the encounter-one of them, eventually, being fear. With regard to the affective turn, only some of those other elements are linked to a representational economy, while others work outside processes of cognition through their bare materiality, or their nonconscious habituation. We also highlight the productive power of discourse and hegemony in determining the outcome of assemblages. Because of America's history, the CEO's skin color is an especially pertinent component of the assemblage that limits his ability to act upon other components of the scene, most obviously his ability to achieve a desired action: hailing a cab."
Education & Educational Research	The aim of this study was to determine differences in some anthropometric characteristics and motor abilities of students at the Faculty of Teacher Education and students of the Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education. The results were compared using the Euro-fit standards. The sample consisted of 148 students of the Faculty of Teacher Education and 206 students of the Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education from Kaunas. The age of students of both faculties ranged between 19-22 years. The sample of variables consisted of three measures used to assess the anthropometric characteristics, and five tests for the assessment of motor skills. Descriptive statistics were calculated based on the collected data, while ANOVA was used for the purpose of determining the difference in measured variables between two student groups. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in measured anthropometric characteristics, but statistically significant differences in favour of the Lithuanian students were obtained for balance and repetitive speed in favour of the students of Faculty of Teacher Education. However, in light of the Euro-fit standards, it can be concluded that the results for both groups of students fall into the category of below average results in all tests. It is however important to emphasize that the results of this study show that both Croatian and Lithuanian students are in the category of normal values of body mass index.
Health Policy & Services	Background: Shift work is a source of health problems for workers around the world. The metabolic syndrome is one of the pathologies that can occur because of this work pattern. Aims: Investigate possible association between shift work and the development risk of the metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among male gender agents of company of electricity production in the Center of Tunisia. This population was divided into two groups according to the organization of their work: a group of shift workers and a group of non-shift workers. Data collection was based on a questionnaire, a dinical examination and a biological assessment. The definition of International Diabetes Federation 2005 (IDF) was adopted to retain the diagnosis of the MS. Results: A total of 263 agents responded to our invitation with a participation rate of 65.5%. The shift workers group accounted for 48.3% of the participants and the fixed workers group accounted for 51.7% of the participants. The diagnosis of MS was retained in 51.2% of shift workers and 27.2% of non-posted workers, with a statistically significant difference (p <10-3). This association persisted after adjusting for the confounding variables with an OR of 2.64 [L38-5.04]. Conclusion: Our study underlined a higher risk of MS development among shift workers. These findings highlight the importance of taking specific preventive measures. This prevention is based not only on hygieno-dietetic measures and regular physical activity, but also the improvement of working conditions.
Business, Finance	We examine whether short interest improves the informativeness of stock prices with respect to future earnings. We find that short selling strengthens the relation between current returns and future earnings, especially in settings where short sellers are likely to possess an information advantage, such as when a firm's information environment is weak or when analysts are highly optimistic about future earnings growth. Collectively, our results illustrate the important role that short sellers play in improving the extent to which current stock prices reflect information about future earnings and thus in improving market efficiency.
History	"Drawing upon archival sources detailing abduction for marriage, this article explores the nature and extent of women's agency in the formation of the family in the honor-based culture of early modern Istria. This area's numerous sources present a diversity of situations. There were instances in which women were forcibly abducted and raped; other instances in which women consented to follow their ""abductor"" against the will of their parents; in other instances, women-usually widows or orphans-were compelled by imminent danger to move in with a man (a consensual abduction, perhaps, but brought about under adverse conditions). Despite the diversity of these situations, these cases share a common cultural feature: the importance of female and family honor. Whether a woman lost her sexual honor forcibly or willingly, marriage usually followed in order to restore the honor of both the woman and her family. Considering the overriding importance of honor and the limitations it imposed on women, I address the nature and extent of women's agency. I explore how women negotiated their place in abduction-based conflicts, and I propose that women's agency was rooted in the reparable and negotiable nature of honor in Istria; this picture was complicated by the greater assertion of state and church jurisdictions. Although situated at the periphery of the Venetian state, Istria was far from being uninfluenced by the sway of central institutions. The Catholic Church was particularly influential in Istria. Therefore, I argue that the nature and extent of women's agency in abductions is fully understood only by also exploring central institutions' rationales and modalities of power assertion over abduction-based conflicts and their resolutions."
Ethics	Cosmopolitanism or cosmic/universal citizenship is a powerful ethical and political discourse that has been deployed in a variety of ways since its inception in the Ancient Greek world. The present article briefly surveys a selection of contemporary mainstream accounts, which are also liberal, top-down accounts, as represented by David Held, Jurgen Habermas, and Martha Nuss-baum. It then proceeds to outline a number of critiques, of which it is suggested the most important are the concept's supposed relation to imperialism and the tendency in liberal discourses to erase political antagonism. I then proceed to show how a range of bottom-up and radical approaches, as represented by Fuyuki Kurosawa, Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Jacques Derrida, Hardt and Negri, and Costas Douzinas, can serve to imagine cosmopolitanism differendy. My aim is restricted to showing that it is possible, contrary to common understanding, to conceive cosmopolitanism outside standard liberal discourses and in terms of a radically democratic, anti-hegemonic, and antagonistic mode of political resistance. I conclude, somewhat paradoxically, that it is only when cosmopolitanism acts against cosmopolitanism that the concept's place in the history of ideas is not foreclosed.
Criminology & Penology	This article examines the impact of acquittal of homicide defendants on the families of the homicide victim(s), illustrating how the families' trauma was framed and complicated by the criminal justice process. Homicide trials had particularly compounded their trauma because to manage and partially repair the shattered reality wrought by the homicide, the families were compelled to construct moral and causal narratives about the event. Yet, defense counter-narratives conflicted with those of the families, and the acquittal validated those as truth. This fractured the families' repair work, denied their claims to victimhood, and prolonged their bereavement indefinitely.
Social Work	The impact of parental styles in intergenerational transmission of trauma among mothers who survived the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, in power from 1975 to 1979, and their teenaged children was examined in 2 studies. In Study 1, 46 Cambodian female high school students and their mothers were recruited. Each daughter completed anxiety and depression measures as well as assessment of her mother's role-reversing, overprotective, and rejecting parental styles, whereas the mothers completed measures of their trauma exposure during the Khmer Rouge regime and PTSD symptoms. In support of trauma transmission, the mother's PTSD symptoms were predictive of her daughter's anxiety. Moreover, the mother's role-reversing parental style was shown to mediate the relationship between her own and her daughter's symptoms. In support of their generalizability, the results were replicated in Study 2 in a Cambodian-American refugee sample comparing 15 mental health treatment-seeking mothers and their teenaged children with 17 nontreatment-seeking mother-child pairs. The implications of the findings within the larger literature on intergenerational trauma transmission stemming from genocide are discussed.
Ethics	This paper makes a plea for more reflexive attempts to develop and anchor the emerging concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI). RRI has recently emerged as a buzzword in science policy, becoming a focus of concerted experimentation in many academic circles. Its performative capacity means that it is able to mobilise resources and spaces despite no common understanding of what it is or should be 'made of'. In order to support reflection and practice amongst those who are interested in and using the concept, this paper unpacks understandings of RRI across a multi-disciplinary body of peer-reviewed literature. Our analysis focuses on three key dimensions of RRI (motivations, theoretical conceptualisations and translations into practice) that remain particularly opaque. A total of 48 publications were selected through a systematic literature search and their content was qualitatively analysed. Across the literature, RRI is portrayed as a concept that embeds numerous features of existing approaches to govern and assess emerging technologies. Our analysis suggests that its greatest potential may be in its ability to unify and provide political momentum to a wide range of long-articulated ethical and policy issues. At the same time, RRI's dynamism and resulting complexity may represent its greatest challenge. Further clarification on what RRI has to offer in practice-beyond what has been offered to date-is still needed, as well as more explicit engagement with research and institutional cultures of responsibility. Such work may help to realise the high political expectations that are attached to nascent RRI.
Linguistics	"Proposals are made to expand and refine previous analyses of coordination in Cognitive Grammar. The account presupposes a number of general notions established independently: (i) flexible symbolic assemblies (rather than constituency) as the basis for describing grammar; (ii) a dynamic view of structure (as patterns of activity occurring in windows of attention on different time scales); (iii) a metaphor involving access, activation, and conceptual overlap (to complement the standard compositional metaphor); and (iv) various kinds of abstraction (including schematicity, the type/instance distinction, and the invocation of virtual entities). Coordination is characterized as the mental juxtaposition of entities conceived as being analogous. These notions are first employed to describe the conjoining of constituents, including clauses. Non-constituent coordination is analyzed in the context of other sorts of clausal ""reduction"", including the accentual reduction of unfocused elements in English as well as ellipsis, where overlapping content is left unexpressed. A pivotal descriptive notion is the differential, i.e. the content appearing in one clausal window that does not appear in the prior window. The anti-differential consists of any previously active content that the differential conflicts with and suppresses. Non-constituent coordination is a special case of ellipsis where the differential and anti-differential function as conjuncts."
Education, Special	This article examined the reporting of four elements of fidelity of implementation (FOI) in parent-mediated early communication treatment studies. Thirty-five studies were reviewed to extract information regarding reporting of dosage, adherence, quality, and participant responsiveness for both practitioners and parents involved in parent-delivered communication treatment for children birth to 6 years of age. Results indicate relatively low reporting practices across the four elements of FOI for both practitioners and parents. Most studies (71%) reported dosage at the practitioner level (e.g., number and length of parent-training sessions), while few studies (14%) reported dosage at the parent level (i.e., amount of intervention implemented by parents outside of treatment sessions). Results also found 60% of studies reported adherence for parent implementation, but only 34% of studies reported adherence for practitioners. Implications for low reporting in the research literature, as well as recommendations for future reporting and research on FOI, are provided.
Sociology	In this research note we present the first data collected in Spain on the political uses of the Internet, including consumption of political information, reception of mobilizing stimuli through the Internet, and online political participation. We explore the data by describing the indicators and then checking whether it is possible to identify the same modes of online political participation that are usually identified in the offline arena. Our results show that online political participation stands as an independent mode, while at the same time some of its features may complement offline modes such as contacting.
International Relations	This article argues that the evolution of the Europeanization research program and that of the literature on Turkey has come evolved incongruously. The article identifies the limits of this interaction, investigates the conceptual, theoretical and methodological origins of these limits, and concludes that such incongruence may be overcome by cross-utilization of the conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and research design tools offered by the Europeanization research program more effectively in studying Turkey. Doing so will allow studying the exclusive impact of the EU on the processes of transformation in Turkey by isolating its transformative role from the impact of other domestic dynamics and international factors.
Substance Abuse	Introduction and AimsThis study examined prevalence of alcohol consumption among immigrants and the Canadian-born populations of Ontario by ethnic origin, and the association between ethnicity, country of birth, age at arrival, length of residence in Canada and drinking measures. Design and MethodsData were derived from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Monitor, a cross-sectional survey of Ontario adults, conducted between January 2005 and December 2010 (n=13557). ResultsThe prevalence of alcohol consumption and risk drinking was generally lower among foreign-born than Canadian-born respondents, but significant variations across ethnic groups were found. In general, foreign-born respondents of European descent reported higher rates of alcohol use and risk drinking than foreign-born respondents from other ethnic groups. We also observed that ethnicity effects varied by whether or not respondents were born in Canada, and by the age at which they arrived in Canada. Discussion and ConclusionsWhile previous studies generally found an increase in immigrants' alcohol consumption with years in Canada, our data suggest that longer duration of residence may have either positive or negative effects on immigrants' alcohol use, depending on the country of origin/traditional drinking pattern. More research is needed to explore determinants of alcohol use and risk drinking among immigrants and to identify those groups at highest risk.

Linguistics	The main purpose of this article is to determine the syntactic nature of the particle suo in passive constructions in Classical Chinese. We argue that this particle is licensed in a similar, though not identical, fashion in Classical relatives and passives. More specifically, it is licensed in an A'-configuration provided by these two constructions and undergoes overt N-0 to I-0 movement. Crucially, however, suo does not undergo further I-0 to C-0 movement at LF in Classical passives. and thus contrasts with its counterpart in Classical relatives, which, as claimed by Ting (2005) exhibits such an operation. Under this analysis, the particle suo in Classical relatives bears a [+wh] feature whereas its counterpart in Classical passives; bears a [-wh] feature and is bound by a null operator. The former is thus an operator whereas the latter is a variable. The implications of this analysis' that emerge for the 'short' passives in Classical Chinese and for the 'linker' between a relative clause and its head noun in Classical and Contemporary Chinese are also discussed. The result of this investigation is shown to resolve the long-lasting controversy over the status of suo in relatives and passives in Classical Chinese and furthermore to provide an example of applying new theoretical tools to the study of Classical Chinese grammar.
History	In the twelfth-thirteenth centuries massive quantities of bronze coin issued by the Song dynasty in China were exported and became the de facto monetary standard throughout maritime East Asia. However, the cessation of minting by the Ming dynasty in the 143os provoked a monetary crisis. Private coinage proliferated both in China and abroad, creating a profusion of heterogeneous transactional currencies and numerous regional monetary circuits. This paper examines monetary circulation in maritime East Asia-encompassing China, Japan, Ryukyu, Vietnam, and Java-during the fifteenth-seventeenth centuries in order to re-assess the impact of Chinese coin in fostering monetary integration (and disintegration).
Family Studies	This study investigates the influence of family context and community context on children's social reasoning about parental negotiation of the gendered roles of breadwinner and caretaker. Participants included 272 seven- and ten-year-old children from traditional and nontraditional parental employment situations, who lived in either a U.S. east coast metropolitan area or in a military-minded community. Children provided judgments and justifications about a parent's desire to switch roles, the other parent's opposition, and the use of stereotypes to defend their opposition. Children's judgments were affected by the gender of parent wanting a new role, age of child, and both personal contexts. The current study provides evidence that children, not just adults, are aware of, and can reason about, parental roles and that it is important to investigate community norms in addition to direct family contexts.
Public Administration	The prevailing paradigm of outsourcing in local government assumes high-level professional administrators make systematic assessments of program areas to determine whether a selected number could be delivered for a reduced cost and at a higher quality by an external provider. This article examines two fundamental deviations from this model occurring in local governments. First, a handful of newly incorporated cities have adopted a wholesale approach to contracting out, relying almost exclusively on private firms and other governmental jurisdictions for the production of core programs while employing only a handful of in-house staff. Conversely, several small towns and cities across North Carolina deliver most services and programs in house by permanent staff but contract out the highest-level administrative position, that of town or city manager. These strategies represent outsourcing at its most extreme and present important practical and paradigmatic challenges to public human resource management in contemporary subnational governance.
Transportation	Using the 2011 Swedish national travel survey data, this paper explores the influence of weather characteristics on individuals' home-based trip chaining complexity. A series of panel mixed ordered Probit models are estimated to examine the influence of individual/household social demographics, land use characteristics, and weather characteristics on individuals' home-based trip chaining complexity. A thermal index, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), is used in this study instead of using directly measured weather variables in order to better approximate the effects of the thermal environment. The effects of UTCI are segmented into different seasons to account for the seasonal difference of UTCI effects. Moreover, a spatial expansion method is applied to allow the impacts of UTCI to vary across geographical locations, as individuals in different regions have different weather/climate adaptions. The effects of weather are examined in subsistence, routine, and discretionary trip chains. The results reveal that the 'ground covered with snow' condition is the most influential factor on the number of trips chained per trip chain among all other weather factors. The variation of UTCI significantly influences trip chaining complexity in autumn but not in spring and winter. The routine trip chains are found to be most elastic towards the variation of UTCI. The marginal effects of UTCI on the expected number of trips per routine trip chain have considerable spatial variations, while these spatial trends of UTCI effects are found to be not consistent over seasons.
Linguistics	"Linguistic democratization, the goal or practice of increasing social equity through language, has not figured prominently in corpus studies. However, corpus-based approaches present the opportunity to probe questions of unequal linguistic representation on a large scale, providing crucial insights into how actors are classified in public discourse, especially with respect to the representation of gender relations and inequity. This paper draws on corpus methods to analyze the patterning of two generic, gendered nouns-womanandman-in American news television discourse. Results of both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that patterns for both grammatical factors (syntactic function, determiner type, pre-modification) and collocational behavior are largely consistent across networks, suggesting that gender ideologies expressed by newscasters and talk show hosts on both networks are not substantially different from one another. This study shows how elements of discourse that may be considered innocuous and below the level of consciousness-such as the position of certain nouns in the sentence, the determiners that specify them, and the adjectives that modify them-can provide valuable diagnostics of discourse-level democratization, and reveal deeper sociocultural ideologies about gendered individuals that are regularly perpetuated in public news discourse, regardless of the networks"" own political positioning."
Education, Special	Minority student disproportionate representation in special education has been debated and (increasingly) studied in the United States for the past 40 years. The purpose of this article is to place this problem in the larger arena of equity studies related to difference in educational practice and propose a comparative model to study it. A first step in the creation of a comparative interdisciplinary paradigm is the. publication of this special series. The authors theorize the disproportionality problem and critique U.S. research on the topic before introducing the articles included in this issue, which cover six nations on four continents. The authors conclude with a discussion of key themes to include in the next generation of comparative interdisciplinary research on disproportionality.
Urban Studies	"Since 1978, market transition in China has significantly influenced the roles of the state, the market and the residents in urban restructuring. Since 2008, the central government has initiated Shantytown Redevelopment Projects (SRPs) to improve the living conditions of low-income residents. Between 2008 and 2012, about 12.6 million households were involved in SRPs, and forced to move as their dwellings were demolished. This paper investigates how SRPs are implemented by revealing how different stakeholders interact in SRPs in the city of Shenyang, China. Through in-depth interviews with various stakeholders and analysis of policy documentation on SRPs, the paper reveals a complex interplay between different stakeholders, which is characterized by the centralization of the inception of SRPs, the decentralization of actual SRP implementation, changes in the role of market forces, and decreasing housing affordability and multiple deprivation of residents in SRP target areas. Various stakeholders have consensus on the need for improving the living conditions in deprived neighbourhoods and on boosting the housing market. However, conflicts arise due to frictions between the central and local governments regarding the implementation of SRPs. We also find evidence of an entrepreneurial paradox in the relationship between local governments and developers. Finally, a mismatch occurs between the scope of the SRP policy and residents"" attempts to improve their socioeconomic situation."
Ethnic Studies	The discourse of hospitality is widely used as a way of making sense of the relationships between 'natives' and 'newcomers' established by immigration. While at first glance this seems a generous and benign system of meaning to apply to relations of immigration, the reality is more complex than this initial view suggests. Relations of hospitality are power relations in which the sovereignty of the host and their possession of the national 'homeland' are asserted over new arrivals. These relationships are complicated further in the case of settler societies, such as New Zealand, where the role of host has been usurped by the settler community. Drawing on the analysis of interview data with young white New Zealanders, in this article I highlight the power relations of hospitality and draw attention to both the value and limitations of this discourse in making sense of relations of immigration in the longer term.
Business	"Previous research has illustrated the importance of family businesses and significant differences between family and nonfamily businesses. Such differences will likely affect auditing for family versus nonfamily businesses. The authors emphasize experimental research labeled as ""audit judgment and decision making research."" They argue that some aspects of people, tasks, and environment are different between family and nonfamily businesses and that these differences affect auditor judgments. A range of theoretical frameworks applicable to auditing research related to family businesses are considered. The authors suggest potential research opportunities related to auditor judgments, auditor-client negotiations, the demand for auditing, audit quality, corporate governance, and internal audit."
Environmental Studies	It is extremely important for biodiversity conservation that protected areas are resilient to a range of potential future perturbations. One of the least studied influences on protected area resilience is that of disease. We argue that wildlife disease (1) is a social-ecological problem that must be approached from an interdisciplinary perspective; (2) has the potential to lead to changes in the identity of protected areas, possibly transforming them; and (3) interacts with conservation both directly (via impacts on wild animals, livestock, and people) and indirectly (via the public, conservation management, and veterinary responses). We use southern African protected areas as a case study to test a framework for exploring the connections between conservation, endemic disease, and social-ecological resilience. We first define a set of criteria for the social-ecological identity of protected areas. We then use these criteria to explore the potential impacts of selected diseases (foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, malaria, rabies, rift valley fever, trypanosomiasis, and canine distemper) on protected area resilience. Although endemic diseases may have a number of direct impacts on both wild animals and domestic animals and people, the indirect pathways by which diseases influence social-ecological resilience also emerge as potentially important. The majority of endemic pathogens found in protected areas do not kill large numbers of wild animals or infect many people, and may even play valuable ecological roles; but occasional disease outbreaks and mortalities can have a large impact on public perceptions and disease management, potentially making protected areas unviable in one or more of their stated aims. Neighboring landowners also have a significant impact on park management decisions. The indirect effects triggered by disease in the human social and economic components of protected areas and surrounding landscapes may ultimately have a greater influence on protected area resilience than the direct ecological perturbations caused by disease.
Social Issues	"The Reformed-Scholastic view of the relationship between God and the human being in F. Gomarus (1563-1641) and J. Arminius (1560-1609): A historical-philosophical investigation The question about the relationship between God and the human being is as old as the history of humanity. This may also be regarded as a central issue at the Synod of Dordt (1618-1619), as well as the decisions of the Synod formulated in the Canons of Dordt (1619). These Canons are today still accepted as one of the official confessions of Reformed Churches in different parts of the world. However it gradually transpired that the Canons did not reach an altogether satisfactory solution. Reformed theologians from the previous and present century became aware of the fact that not everything in the Canons matched up. Some of them only wrote about unevenness or irregularities and attempted to solve the problem by means of a distinction between the form (wording), which could be incorrect, while the basic contents of the Canons may not be queried. Other theologians, however, did look a little closer and called attention to the use of an Aristotelian doctrine of causality, influencing basic arguments in the Canons. Such biblically-foreign ideas also distorted the Canons 'view of the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. This contribution (continuing previous contributions elsewhere) takes as point of departure that merely rejecting Aristotelian causality is insufficient. A much broader and deeper look should be taken at the whole philosophy or view of reality behind the Canons. Apart from a philosophical analysis of the Canons themselves (to be published soon), it may also be helpful to analyse the theology and its philosophical presuppositions of two of the influential viewpoints at the Synod, viz, that of the Reformed theologian E Gomarus (1563-1641) and his Arminian opponent, J. Arminius (1560-1609). The investigation develops through the following stages. As background a general philosophical characterization of Reformed Scholastic thinking is provided. From a normative (directional) perspective it is described as synthesis philosophy. It combined biblical revelation with extra-biblical ideas from Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. This synthesis was facilitated through two methods. Firstly through eisegesis-exegesis, according to which pre-Christian ideas were read into parts of Scripture (eisegesis) and afterwards - with the sanction of the Scriptures - explained from the Bible (exegesis). Secondly, synthesis was achieved by way of a nature-grace dualism, which in turn resulted in a distinction between reason and faith, philosophy and theology. Apart from its synthetic direction, Reformed Scholasticism's type of philosophy is also explained: its specific idea of law, purely cosmological thinking, ontological dualism, vertical partial universalism, anthropological dichotomy and semi-mysticism. This characterisation (according to the problem-historical method of philosophical historiography) simultaneously implies a foundational critique of Reformed Scholasticism. Against this background the second main section of the essay investigates and compares the theological and underlying philosophical viewpoints of Gomarus and Arminius. The surprising result of the investigation can be summarised as follows. From a philosophical perspective it becomes evident how little these two representatives of the clashing Reformed and Arminian viewpoints actually differed from each other They both adhered to a purely cosmological, dualistic and vertical partial universalistic philosophy. However, they were proponents of different anthropologies: Gomarus was an intellectualist and Arminius an empiricist. Arminius 'viewpoint was furthermore different from that of Pelagianism (a heresy ascribed to by the Remonstrant followers of Arminius), because he was not a consistent empiricist (like Pelagius), but advocated non-consistent empiricism. An added difference was that both Gomarus and Arminius accepted certain ideas of Aristotle, and can therefore be described as Aristotelians, but that Arminius was more Plato-oriented and therefore regarded the human will as of more importance than was the case with intellectualists like Gomarus. These philosophical anthropological differences resulted in different theological views on the relationship between God and mankind. The final result of the ""mine sweeping"" to detect unbiblical ""land-mines"" underneath the theological soil of Dordt is the following: The conflict between the Reformed and Arminian positions was not primarily a clash between what the Bible taught (the Reformed side) and unbiblical heresy (the Arminians), but a clash between two different forms of especially Aristotelian influenced philosophies which were superimposed onto the Scriptures. If the Synod of Dordt was aware of this, the sad history of ecclesiastical divisions up to the present day could have been avoided. At the same time these results call for further reflection. Firstly exactly how Aristotle's ideas of God and causality (which influenced Dordt) could be defined. Secondly, how should the relationship between God and mankind be viewed according to a philosophy based on Scripture instead of onAristotle's ideas? Answers to these questions will be dealt with in a follow-up article in this journal."
Transportation	"There has been a marked increase in the number of young drivers across the globe. This age category comes with deficiencies resulting from their inexperience and age-related characteristics. Mobility is a fundamental right of living by everyone whether young or old, and learning to drive is considered as a significant achievement in youth's life. However, the mobility of a younger driver by his or her own vehicles demands special considerations. The number and types of crashes caused by younger drivers indicate that they are considered as vulnerable users on roads and a risk to others (i.e., other motorists, pedestrians, and passengers). In this study, the authors identified and illustrated the potential causes of crashes by younger drivers and introduced the available measures to mitigate the crash risk. The risk of crash by younger drivers is systematically and logically modelled using fault tree analysis. Subsequently, the risk state of driving by younger drivers at a given time is mathematically modelled. Furthermore, the authors proposed the concept of ""riskometer"" as an interactive in-vehicle tool to monitor the risk state of driving for younger drivers on the road. The research concludes with discussions and recommendations on directions for potential applications and future research works."
Demography	We used data from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Stuck of Adolescent Health to examine family boundary ambiguity in adolescent and mother reports of family structure and found that the greater the family complexity, the more likely adolescent and mother reports of family structure were discrepant. This boundary ambiguity in reporting was most pronounced for cohabiting stepfamilies. Among mothers who reported living with a cohabiting partner only one-third of their teenage children also reported residing in a cohabiting stepfamily. Conversely, for those adolescents who reported their family structure as a cohabiting stepfamily just two-thirds of their mothers agreed. Levels of agreement between adolescents and mothers about residing in a two-biological-parent family, single-mother family, or married stepfamily were considerably higher Estimates of the distribution of adolescents across family structures vary according to whether adolescent mother or combined reports are used Moreover the relationship between family structure and family processes differed depending on whose reports of family structure were used and boundary ambiguity was associated with several key family processes. Family boundary ambiguity presents an important measurement challenge for family scholars.
Substance Abuse	Though research on drug and driving under the influence (DUI) courts increased significantly in the past two decades, very little has focused on women's participation in these programs and how gender may have influenced clients' performance, despite the call of feminist criminologists that entry into crime and substance abuse is different for women. Based on data collected from Tulsa County DUI and Drug programs in Oklahoma, this study examines the impact of gender on clients' performance in both programs. In addition to identifying associations between clients' gender and demographics, criminal history, addiction problems, and other medical and mental health problems, this study explores gender's impact on both program progress (e. g., program length, use of sanctions, relapse) and final outcome (termination vs. graduation). Data show that different factors are associated with female entry into drug and DUI courts and successful completion of the program compared with men, which calls for gender tailored treatment for women.
Transportation	Household vehicle ownership, and the associated dimensions including fleet size, vehicle type and usage, has been one of the most researched transport topics. This paper endeavors to provide a critical overview of the wide-ranging methodological approaches employed in vehicle ownership modeling depending on the ownership representation over the past two decades. The studies in the existing literature based on the vehicle ownership representation are classified as: exogenous static, exogenous dynamic, endogenous static and endogenous dynamic models. The methodological approaches applied range from simple linear regressions to complex econometrics formulations taking into account a rich set of covariates. In spite of the steady advancement and impressive evolution in terms of methodological approaches to examine the decision process, we identify complex issues that pose a formidable challenge to address the evolution of vehicle ownership in the coming years. Specifically, we discuss challenges with data availability and methodological framework selection. In light of these discussions, we provide a decision matrix for aiding researchers/practitioners in determining appropriate model frameworks for conducting vehicle ownership analysis.
Women'S Studies	Women with diverse disabilities (N = 213), recruited through 10 centers for independent living (CILs), were randomly assigned to either a personal safety awareness program or usual care. The 8-week program, led by CIL staff, was designed to increase safety awareness, abuse and safety knowledge, safety skills, safety self-efficacy, social support, and safety promoting behaviors. All participants completed pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up questionnaires. Results revealed that participation in a brief safety awareness program may improve safety protective factors among women with disabilities who vary widely in their experience with abuse. The program holds promise for enhancing safety among women with disabilities.
Criminology & Penology	"Institutional reactions to criminal behavior require extensive discussion. By drawing primarily on findings and debates of current Anglophone criminology, this contribution deals with a specific subarea of this complex matter, namely the significance claimed by recent ""evidence-based"" research on the efficacy of specific measures and its ramifications for penal policy and practice. Debates of evidence-based research hint at two pressing issues: its usage to justify interventions and the requirement to do justice to the substantially subjective and contextual nature of penal sanctions. For evidence-based criminology, both aspects are inherently challenging. Consequently, it appears to be necessary to take evidence-based findings seriously but, concomitantly, to broaden the respective concept of ""evidence-based"" in order to foster and bolster a pluralistic landscape of criminological research that is not committed to just one paradigm of academic research."
Education, Special	Although, collectively, results of earlier direct observation studies suggest momentary time sampling (MTS) may offer certain technical advantages over whole-interval (WIR) and partial-interval (PIR) recording, no study has compared these methods for measuring engagement in young children in naturalistic environments. This study compared direct observations of child engagement using WIR, PIR, and MTS methods to continuous duration recording (CDR), using measurement error, correlations, and inter-observer agreement. Results indicated that MTS consistently demonstrated measurements closer to CDR compared with PIR and WIR, although in this study, the differences between MTS and PIR across indicators were not as great as has been demonstrated in the literature. WIR, PIR, and MTS were all strongly correlated with CDR, although there were issues with under and overestimations. Finally, the four observational methods were all moderately to strongly correlated with expert ratings of engagement, although none was significantly correlated with teacher rankings of classroom engagement.
Area Studies	This study provides one of the first empirical tests of the political impact of dibao, China's anti-poverty cash transfer programme. Using the China Family Panel Study 2010 data set and a propensity score matching method, the authors examine whether and the extent to which dibao benefits have impacted recipients' assessment of local government performance. To investigate the heterogeneity effect of dibao, the authors conducted separate analyses for urban and rural same s. Results have shown that receiving dibao benefits had a significant and positive impact on citizens' assessment of local government in China. Nonetheless, the subsample results suggest that the positive and significant impacts of dibao benefits might be driven mainly by the rural sample. Overall, the study implies that China's dibao policy has achieved a mixed success in alleviating discontent and boosting popular support for the government.
Criminology & Penology	This article presents a critical review of the taxonomic theory of adolescent-limited and life-course persistent anti-social behaviour (Moffitt 1993) and its empirical evidence. This influential theory suggests that there are two qualitatively distinct types of offenders that require distinct theoretical explanations. Moreover, the empirical evidence for the typology is considered to be strong, at least by some. I discuss along three lines: first, to what extent the taxonomy should be interpreted literally; second, whether the suggested mechanisms are likely to produce the hypothesized groups; third, whether some of the most important empirical evidence really does support the theory. I conclude that the theoretical arguments are surprisingly unclear on key issues and that the empirical evidence is highly problematic.
Ethics	"Our subject is how the experience of Americans with a certain funding criterion, ""broader impacts"" (and some similar criteria) may help in efforts to turn the European concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into a useful guide to funding Europe's scientific and technical research. We believe this comparison may also be as enlightening for Americans concerned with revising research policy. We have organized our report around Ren, Von Schomberg's definition of RRI, since it seems both to cover what the European research group to which we belong is interested in and to be the only widely accepted definition of RRI. According to Von Schomberg, RRI: ""aEuro broken vertical bar is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society)."" While RRI seeks fundamental changes in the way research is conducted, Broader Impacts is more concerned with more peripheral aspects of research: widening participation of disadvantaged groups, recruiting the next generation of scientists, increasing the speed with which results are used, and so on. Nevertheless, an examination of the broadening of funding criteria over the last four decades suggests that National Science Foundation has been moving in the direction of RRI."
Nursing	Purpose: Explore views of mothers about pain and pain treatment practices in hospitalized newborn infants. Design and methods: A Qualitative descriptive study using photo-elicitation technique was conducted in a level I and a level II neonatal units in Kenya. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers of hospitalized infants. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive content analysis approach. Results: Mothers described the experience of witnessing their infants undergo painful procedures as emotionally and psychologically traumatic. Participants felt helpless for not being able to protect their infants from pain a situation which was made worse by health care providers who appeared less concerned about pain relief during procedures. Mothers' views demonstrated a good understanding of pain-relief strategies; they identified strategies that health care providers should routinely use to relief pain in hospitalized infants. Furthermore, participants desired to be involved in comforting their infants during clinical procedures. Conclusion: Repeated and untreated painful procedures continue to define the hospitalisation experience of newborn infants despite the presence of mothers who desire to be involved in comforting their infants during procedures.

Political Science	In recent years, the public sphere, which represents a realm in civil society where people can debate and discuss a range of issues and common concerns important to them, has become a key area for research in the humanities and social sciences. Arguably, however, Marxist theory has yet to advance a theoretical account of the most abstract and simple ideological properties of the capitalist public sphere as these appear under universal commodity relationships. The paper therefore tentatively seeks to develop such an account. Specifically, the paper theoretically derives a peculiar public sphere under capitalism, which is mediated between at least two commodity owners who also possess distinctive personalities driven by desires to own commodities. The paper then explains in more detail how the social form of this public sphere develops through other elements of commodity relations and their contradictions.
Nursing	Despite a recent high funding priority on technological aspects of research and a high potential impact ofWeb-based interventions on health, few guidelines for the development of Web-based interventions are currently available. In this article, we propose practical guidelines for development of Web-based interventions based on an empirical study and an integrative literature review. The empirical study aimed at development of a Web-based physical activity promotion program that was specifically tailored to Korean American midlife women. The literature review included a total of 202 articles thatwere retrieved throughmultiple databases. On the basis of the findings of the study and the literature review, we propose directions for development ofWeb-based interventions in the following steps: (1) meaningfulness and effectiveness, (2) target population, (3) theoretical basis/program theory, (4) focus and objectives, (5) components, (6) technological aspects, and (7) logistics for users. The guidelines could help promote further development of Web-based interventions at this early stage of Web-based interventions in nursing.
Social Work	This paper presents the results of a preliminary study aimed to gain insight into the frequency of presenting elderly people (65 years and older) in central news broadcast reports of HRT and RTL television networks. The study was conducted for 14 days in April 2017 and used TV reports (N = 367) in the studied sample. A quantitative analysis of the news content was conducted, and the obtained results were processed by descriptive statistics. According to the preliminary results of the study, elderly people are poorly represented, appearing in only 37 broadcast reports out of a total of 367 (10.08%).
History	This article examines squatter resistance to a World Bank-funded forest and paper factory project. The article illustrates how diverse actors came together at the sites of rural development projects in early postcolonial Kenya. It focuses on the relationship between the rural squatters who resisted the project and the political elites who intervened, particularly President Kenyatta. Together, these two groups not only negotiated the reformulation of a major international development program, but they also worked out broader questions about political authority and political culture. In negotiating development, rural actors and political elites decided how resources would be distributed and they entered into new patronage-based relationships, processes integral to the making of the postcolonial political order.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	Stigma may result in tense social interactions and discrimination between stigmatisers and stigmatised individuals. Despite its social relevance, stigma has been largely neglected in tourism sociocultural studies. Framed by Goffman?s and Falk?s theoretical propositions of social stigma, this paper aimed to explore local?s stigmatisation of tourists? behaviour. This study revealed that locals? stigmatisation of tourists? behaviours can be spatially negotiated and deconstructed through social interactions. The data analysis also found that not all tourists are equally stigmatised and that tourists? conduct can be highly stigmatised if adopted by locals. Based on in-depth interviews, these findings were drawn from an examination of locals? perceptions of tourists? nudist behaviours in a Mexican destination. This research?s results contribute to a fuller understanding of how locals (de)construct their stigmas of tourists? behaviours through local-tourist sociocultural interactions.
Political Science	The liberal-democratic spirit of 1989 seems to deny the liberal-socialist spirit of 1968. With regard to the history of mentality, there is in reality a subtle connection between the two events. The new left in the West and dissidents in the East were for a time closer to one another than is remembered. They may have been unable to develop a common force to overcome their respective systems. Nonetheless despite all the blindness and ideological blinders-they provided much of the ferment behind the upheavals.
Ethics	We are not cosmopolitans, if by cosmopolitan we mean that we are willing to prioritize equally the needs of those near and far. Here, I argue that cosmopolitanism has yet to wrestle with the motivational challenges it faces: any good moral theory must be one that well-meaning people will be motivated to adopt. Some cosmopolitans suggest that the principles of cosmopolitanism are themselves sufficient to motivate compliance with them. This argument is flawed, for precisely the reasons that motivate this paper - we are cosmopolitan neither in our attitudes nor in our behaviors towards others. Other cosmopolitans suggest that 'global solidarity' is sufficient to generate a commitment to carrying out duties towards others. These latter efforts implicitly rely on insights best captured by the nationalist thesis, that is, that national communities are the best vehicles, morally speaking, through which individuals can carry out their obligations to others. I consider, and refute, two objections to my argument: first, that it is guilty of a 'time-lag fallacy' and, second, that it ignores an emergent cosmopolitan attitude among global citizens.
Rehabilitation	The 1998 Workforce Investment Act legislation created the One-Stop Career Center system out of a fragmented federal, state and local employment and training system. Among many changes, One-Stop Center staff is now expected to serve individuals with disabilities, a population previously underserved by the former employment and training system. The person-centered, employment planning team (PCEPT) demonstration project was developed to help One-Stop staff work more effectively with one another in serving persons with disabilities seeking job and training placement. This project examines the employment and training trajectory of a self-selected sample of One-Stop customers with psychiatric disabilities. Sixty-five percent were ultimately placed in a job or training program. The PCEPT process appears to fill an important service gap for a minority of individuals with severe disabilities seeking services within the One-Stop System. Replication issues are discussed.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in mobility limitation, activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) in older adults enrolled in Medicare. DESIGN: Longitudinal national survey. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling respondents in the Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey from 1992 to 2004 (10,180-16,788 respondents per year). MEASUREMENTS: Disability-related outcomes included mobility limitation, difficulty in six ADLs and six IADLs. Explanatory variables included age, sex, racial or ethnic group, living situation, and income level. RESULTS: From 1992 to 2004, proportions of Medicare beneficiaries with mobility limitations were stable across racial and ethnic groups, improving slightly for ADLs and IADLs. Blacks reported more limitations in all three disability-related measures. In a longitudinal analysis, the probability of developing mobility limitation was consistently higher for blacks, followed by white Hispanics, white non-Hispanics, and Asians, after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and living situation. For ADL and IADL difficulties, the number of reported difficulties increased with age for all ethnic and racial groups. At approximately age 75, Asians and white Hispanics reported difficulties with much higher numbers of ADLs and IADLs than the other groups. CONCLUSION: Across all ethnic and racial groups, self-reported disability has declined in the past decade, but even after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and living situation, racial and ethnic disparities in disability outcomes persist. Race and ethnicity may influence the reporting of disability, potentially affecting measures of prevalence. Further research is needed to understand whether these differences are a result of perceptions related to disablement or true differences in disability between racial and ethnic groups.
Transportation	Bicycling as a mode of transportation is enjoying a boost in many urban areas around the world. Although there are clear health benefits of increased physical activity while bicycling, bicyclists may experience increased inhalation of traffic-related air pollutants. Bicyclists have two to five times higher respiration rates than travelers in motorized vehicles and this difference increases with bicycle travel speed and exertion level. The main goal of this work is to review the state of knowledge regarding urban bicyclists' intake and uptake of traffic-related air pollution and to identify key knowledge gaps. This review includes not only bicyclists' exposure to air pollution concentrations but also respiration rates, intake doses (the amount of pollutant that is inhaled), and uptake doses (the amount of pollutant that is incorporated into the body). Research gaps and opportunities for future research are discussed. This is the first review to specifically address bicyclists' health risks from traffic-related air pollution and to explicitly include intake and uptake doses in addition to exposure concentrations for travelers.
Communication	"This article investigates the ubiquitous presence of news agencies (or wire services) in the daily news. While considering the international environment, it focuses on the sole Australian news agency, Australian Associated Press (AAP), and on its dominance within the Australian news landscape. The article presents the findings of two case studies, tracing press releases through AAP and into the daily news around the world, while also analyzing the media culture that accepts copy from news agencies as ""gospel""-a commodity to be used and reused without checking accuracy, and often without attribution. In addition, we identify that the heightened status of news agency copy, coupled with the ""not wrong for long"" approach which permeates online news, is a combination which increases the potential for error and inaccuracy. The article suggests the need for a shakeup in how media researchers view news sources, as well as a closer analysis of news agency domination within the news environment. Drawing on political economy theory, it sets the foundations for a larger study which could investigate the contemporary production of news."
Transportation	Although urban rain transit (URT) is an attractive alternative mode of daily travel, barriers exist in URT development across the world, in particular, the high cost of construction and operation and relative low rates of URT ridership. Despite these barriers, URT has gained considerable popularity worldwide in recent years; much of this trend is driven by projects in China. Despite this public support and implementation of URT projects, the ridership, capital costs and cost-effectiveness of URT projects remain largely unstudied. This paper addresses this planning and policy issue by examining line-level ridership and investment data for 97 heavy rail transit (HRT) lines and 12 light rail transit (LRT) lines in 28 Chinese cities. Comparative analysis is conducted so as to evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of HRT and LRT. Multiple linear regression analysis is used to explain the variability of URT cost-effectiveness and how it varies depending on land use density, project design, system service, and multimodal transit integration. Findings indicate that land-use density, line length, number of transfer stations, operation time, and bus ridership significantly contribute to higher levels of URT ridership, while URT ridership decreases significantly with train headway and the station's distance from the city center. It is cost-effective to develop URT in high-density cities in spite of high costs, and some, if not all, LRT lines are more cost-effective than HRT lines. As of this analysis, the overdevelopment of HRT in China has failed to plan for multimodal transport integration and operational optimization. However, these shortcomings are also opportunities for Chinese transportation and land-use planners to develop more cost-effective URT projects that also improve the level of service available to the public.
Ethnic Studies	This study aims to identify, from an ethnographic perspective, how panethnic boundaries are being created between Gitano people and Roma newcomers who have emigrated from eastern to western Europe. This migration has been driven mainly by discrimination and lack of opportunities in eastern Europe after the transition to a new economy. Although Roma immigrants try to keep connected to their regions of origin, changes in their ethnic identities can also be observed when they settle in their new environment. The fieldwork was conducted in a Spanish neighbourhood with a high percentage of Gitanos and Roma immigrants from eastern Europe. Evidence from this research shows how interactions between people from both groups can promote or diminish panethnic identities and the emergence of panethnic institutions. There is mutual identification between the subgroups even though some elements of dissent and rejection may appear. One of the key components to be taken into account in the shaping and institutionalization of a panethnic identity is the presence of dialogic interactions among the Roma people of different subgroups. These interactions give rise, in a hostile context, to a common identity and solidarity among subjects. Indeed, this has been the social and symbolic base that has promoted the incorporation of newcomers in Roma religious institutions.
Business	The aim of this paper is to study 18- to 29-year-old Finnish consumers' use of instant small loans (i.e. SMS loan) and other consumer credit services that have increased notably in the past few years. We examine what kind of expenditures instant credit is used for and focus also on young consumers' financial situation and their perceptions of themselves as money handlers. The research method is quantitative, and data are derived from an open online survey (n = 1610). Our results reveal that consumer credit is used by young people in all income brackets and employment positions. However, there is a clear connection between certain life-course stages (young, single parent), financial positions (low income), employment situations (marginal) and the propensity to take instant loans and consumer credit. The young people who take an instant loan once are likely to do it again. Typical purposes of use included buying alcohol, cigarettes and partying. For some consumers, the use of small loans is part of controlled and economical use of money. However, particularly in the low-income brackets, it is also common to buy food and to repay credit or interest. Young people, who use instant loans recognize flaws in their money management and see themselves as 'wasteful' consumers more often than those who do not use instant loans. On the basis of this empirical study, it is unquestioned that young people's consumer education needs to be strengthened. In Finland, this need has already been recognized in both consumer policy and teacher education.
Women'S Studies	Violence against women is a worldwide social and human rights problem that cuts across cultural, geographic, religious, social, and economic boundaries. It affects women in countries around the world, regardless of class, religion, disability, age, or sexual identity. International evidence shows that approximately three in five women experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. However, across the globe, women and girls with impairments or life-limiting illnesses are more susceptible to different forms of violence across a range of environments and by different perpetrators including professionals and family members as well as partners. However, they are likely to be seriously disadvantaged in gaining information and support to escape the abusive relationships. This article stems from the United Kingdom part of a comparative study with three other countries (Austria, Germany, and Iceland) funded by the European Commission (EC; 2013-2015). It presents preliminary findings, generated from life history interviews, about disabled women's experiences of violence and access to support (both formal and informal) over their life course and their aspirations for the prevention of violence in the future. The article includes examples of impairment-specific violence that non-disabled women do not experience. By bringing the voices of disabled women into the public domain, the article will facilitate a historically marginalized group to contribute to the debate about disability, violence, and support.
Environmental Studies	Staking claim and ownership has remained an antagonistic issue for nations, resulting in many international conflicts. This is particularly so in disputed territories or areas which are deemed the heritage of mankind. In the next 50-years mining in space is set to become a reality and rather than being used to become an asset to man/society and create an equitable world, it is likely to be a battleground for greed and sovereign dominance - an overspill from Earth. This paper researches the conflict between greed and dominance vs. peace and equity in respect to space - mineral resources, providing historical contextualization, opinion, thoughts and interpretation. Hence, consideration is given to international approaches and who should 'police,' plus the governance of, space riches. The research largely considers the stance of the USA in this respect. The relevance of travel and travel modes (particularly air) and ownership of the sky is reviewed, so as to provide comparison and (historical) contextualization - identifying issues previously encountered when man looks to both travel and acquire assets by these means. The latest position of asteroid mining is also explored and 'lessons from Earth' are revisited as part of this research - which is largely considered and undertaken from a legal (discipline) perspective.
Public Administration	IMPACT Central government has created the office of directly-elected mayor and local government has to live with the consequences for good or ill. This paper deals with the role of directly-elected mayors for the combined authorities, raising questions about the effective leadership of sub-national areas of England. The new mayors may require a 'boldness' to work across the boundaries of bureaucratic organizations and to engage with external partners and they enjoy some limited additional resources. Central government explicitly expects the combined authority mayor to exercise their greater powers more efficiently than traditional council leaders. Yet such mayors may lack public endorsement or any degree of active public interest and may ultimately reflect government obsession with structures rather than human agency in reforming local governance. This paper examines the initial experience of directly-elected mayors in the new combined authorities established in England. Do they have an innovative strategic leadership role for sub-national areas and provide a vehicle for effective public engagement, representing a new start for the hitherto faltering progress of the elected mayoral initiative? Alternatively, are the combined authority mayors just another policy failure in the uneven process of local government reform?
Geography	"The simultaneous but incompatible desires for both ""tradition"" and ""advancement"" have produced the ""ambiguity of modernity"" in the areas of minority nationalities (shaoshu minzu diqu) on China's southwest frontier. This paper, in accordance, directly addresses the ambiguity of modernity through the investigation of the tea landscape in Yunnan. This essay builds on Aihwa Ong and Stephen Collier's ""global assemblage"" framework to analyze the relationship between the ""global form"" of modernity and the situated assemblages of ""ambiguity of modernity"" in southwest China. Data are based on ethnographic research in the village of Mangling, located in Jingmai Mountain, a renowned tea mountain in Yunnan. Most of the villagers in Mangling are one of the minority nationalities of China, Bulang. I discuss the state-led project in transforming the modern tea plantation for ""restoring"" a landscape deemed as ""ancient tea forest"" (guchalin) in Mangjing. In addition, I address Bulang villagers' and government officials' multiple responses to the transformation of tea landscapes. I argue that the transformation of tea landscapes has been the practice to turn the ""global form"" of modernity into the shifting ""assemblages"" amongst tradition, modernity, science, and nature. The ambiguity of modernity has emerged from the shifting assemblages, providing both the state and Bulang villagers more leeway to symbolically and physically (re)produce meanings for the tea landscapes to meet the contingent market demand for tea. The transformation of tea landscapes, however, has become another process to perpetuate Bulang villagers' social status of being ""low quality"" as China's minority nationalities.

Education, Special	This replication study focused on the effectiveness of two different intervention approaches, activity-based intervention and embedded direct instruction, on the acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of phonological awareness, a key area of emergent literacy, by preschool children with language delays. Five male preschool participants with language delay were treated with a modified alternating-treatments design. Embedded direct instruction was more effective and efficient in the acquisition of phonological awareness skills for preschool children with language delays. Embedded direct instruction was also more effective in the generalization of emergent literacy skills to probe generalization sessions, as well as in the percentage of maintained skills. Preschool children who are at risk of acquiring foundational skills necessary for the development of conventional literacy would benefit from an explicit, systematic instructional approach. Embedded direct instruction provided the structure necessary to promote effective and efficient acquisition of skills, as well as generalization and maintenance of learning.
Substance Abuse	In many countries, there is increasing interest in early intervention strategies to assist people who are experiencing gambling-related problems. Central to these discussions is whether it is possible to identify problem gambling and/or risky behaviour in situ before gamblers formally seek assistance. This paper provides a review and critique of the small amount of published literature relating specifically to behavioural indicators and their practical application. It concludes that, while there is general agreement concerning the range of indicators that could be used, the process of identification remains difficult in practice. Multiple indicators are usually required to make reliable identifications; the nature of indicators will vary depending on the mode of gambling (land-based vs online), and venue staff employees usually have insufficient opportunity to obtain enough information to make judgments. The potential value of combining behavioural information with electronically monitored gambling data is discussed as a possible future strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of identification processes.
Communication	Drawing on Stuart Hall's influential Notes on deconstructing the popular' [Hall, S. (1981). In R. Samuel (Eds.), People's history and socialist theory (pp. 227-240). London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.], this essay maps out some of the major shifts in cultural studies' relationship to popular culture over the past several decades. It concludes with a call for cultural studies to find ways to work from the terrain of the popular, rather than merely studying that terrain, or trying to translate its scholarly analyses for popular audiences. This is a necessary path to fulfilling its mission as a political project.
Development Studies	Financial inclusion policy has been ignited globally by the rise of money transfer services over mobile phones led by the example of Kenya. This article examines the financial practices of low-income people and the social relational dimensions of debt that underlie these transactions, and contrasts these with widely used services of informal groups and banks' services. This highlights a fiduciary culture where relationships of equality and negotiability dominate in contrast to a tendency towards hierarchical relations with banks. This questions policy-makers' expectations that mobile money transfer will seamlessly facilitate engagement with the formal sector for savings and credit.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	I show that the known fundamental laws of physics - quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the particle physics Standard Model imply that the Singularity will inevitably come to pass. Further I show that there is an ethical system built into science and rationality itself thus the value-fact distinction is nonsense and this will preclude the AI's from destroying humanity even if they wished to do so. Finally, I show that the coming Singularity is good because only if it occurs can life of any sort survive. Fortunately, the laws of physics, as I have said, require the Singularity to occur If the laws of physics be for us, who can be against us?
Industrial Relations & Labor	The authors use the econometric case study method to investigate the direct impact of offline teams on productivity in a non-unionized subsidiary of a multinational firm from January 1999 through November 2001. They analyze daily data on rejection, production, and downtime rates for both team and non-team-member operators. They hypothesize that team membership without complementary involvement practices is initially sufficient to enhance productivity and quality control. Further, the use of teams leads initially to more downtime, but this cost will diminish over time. Findings indicate that membership in offline teams initially increases individual productivity by about 3% and lowers rejection rates by about 27%. These improvements dissipate, however, typically at a rate of 10 to 16% per 100 days in a team. For these benefits to be sustained, team membership must be complemented with measures that provide extrinsic rewards. The authors also find that the performance-enhancing effects of team membership are generally greater and longer-lasting for more educated members.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This article argues that considering individuals' skills is fundamental in explaining tourists' practices. Navigation here is conceptualized as one of the spatial stakes that individuals must address when they inhabit a city. From this question, this article emphasizes the fact that coping with space should not be taken for granted but requires skills that relate to individuals' own levels of experience in terms of the practices of places. To this end, this article first engages in a theoretical discussion of Goffman, Ingold and Wittgenstein's ideas. Then, at the empirical level, importance is given to tourists' experiences, as they describe their ways of coping with space. Through an original mapping of their itineraries in Los Angeles, we examine tourists' justification process concerning their 'regimes d'action'.
Health Policy & Services	Objective: To examine the level of awareness of youths to voluntary counseling and testing and willingness to pay for this service, and to explore reasons for underutilization of this service. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out among undergraduate students of two tertiary institutions in Enugu Nigeria using pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire. Information was collected from 250 respondents per institution. Analysis was done using SPSS computer software package. Results: Most of the respondents (64%) have heard about VCT and 70.6% of the students obtained their information from the mass media (P < 0.05) while a minority (3.8%) heard from families. 76.6% of respondents believe VCT can provide useful information on HIV/AIDS and VCT is obtainable mainly in teaching hospitals (78.5%) and to a lesser extent in government hospitals (9.8%) and NGOs (8.8%), while being almost non existent in private hospitals (2.9%). 81% of the respondents did not attend VCT while only 19% attended. The reasons for non attendance were that majority of the students (45.7%) were unaware of the services (P < 0.05), indifferent to VCT (20.0%), (12.8%) felt it was costly and (13.3%) were afraid of discovering their HIV status. About 50% of the respondents were willing to pay for VCT and the mean willingness to pay was $3.2 (N370). Out of those willing to pay, 46% of them are willing to pay ($2.6) N300 while 34% and 20% are willing to pay $3.4 (N400) and $4.3 (N500), respectively (P < 0.05). Among those not willing to pay, 67.6% of them think it should be free (P < 0.05). Males and people with higher knowledge of VCT stated higher WTP values than females and those with less knowledge of VCT. Log OLS also showed that a higher level in the University was positively related to WTP. Conclusion: The high knowledge of VCT does not reflect on the attendance at VCT clinics. Respondents seem ignorant about where the services can be obtained and they believe VCT should be free or adequately subsidized. The cost of VCT is much higher than the mean WTP and governments should take this into consideration when subsidies are being considered. More VCT centers should be created and widely publicized in various communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
Environmental Studies	Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes, including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2) shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures, compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the implementation of comanagement worldwide.
Communication	Why have few journalists ever stood in the dock for incitement to violate international humanitarian law? Their work as propagandists has been essential to governments committing war crimes, crimes against peace and genocide. The answer matters both because impunity emboldens further violation and because the traditional distinctions between news reporting, news commentary and propaganda, and between journalists, commentators and activists, have eroded due to global news markets and social media. After presenting a brief history of prosecutions and non-prosecutions to establish the relative infrequency of prosecutions, this article reviews possible explanations, several of which are revealed in the foregoing historical survey. This investigation will suggest a multi-causal explanation that leans heavily on assumptions about the privileged position of journalists in liberal societies.
Transportation	This paper defines latent capabilities in marine systems and proposes that latent capabilities can support large-scale emergency response, in which the demand for assistance exceeds the capabilities of dedicated emergency infrastructure. Latent capabilities are functional resources that were neither intended nor recognized during the design phase. Latent capabilities represent an opportunity for ship owners to adapt to swift changes in operating context, responding to new demands that emerge quickly. To enable exploitation of latent capabilities, we suggest a method for identification and implementation of latent capabilities during contingency planning. As a proof-of-concept for latent capabilities, the response to the Macondo oil spill is used as a case study. The case shows that advanced offshore vessels provided latent capabilities that were decisive in shutting down the leaking well. Enabling factors and challenges for this approach are explored, including the impact on vessel economics, the role of the managing organization, and other constraints.
Cultural Studies	This article seeks to dismantle the prevalent claim that Nyerere's Ujamaa policy and Nkrumah's philosophy of Consciencism were of a similar ideological ilk. Often, the two are treated homogeneously within the discourse on African Socialism, and frequently the classic objection is raised that they rely too heavily upon Marxism in seeking to articulate their respective ideologies. By building on the existing literature on scientific socialism, this article seeks to draw a distinction between Marxism as an ideology and Marxism as a methodology. Critics consistently overlook this distinction and fail to consider many of the nuances of Nkrumah's thinking, hastily labelling him as a disciple of African Socialism. By unravelling Nkrumah's political philosophy important differences between him and Nyerere quickly become apparent, in particular the manner in which Consciencism was a dynamic, responsive and evolutionary philosophy, whereas Ujamaa was static, impervious to change and firmly rooted in the past.
Social Work	Supervision is an expanding professional practice in health and social care. To a large extent, this is linked to the growing regulation of health and social care professions and the explicit linking of supervision to quality and accountability. Links can be demonstrated between the revitalisation of supervision as a professional practice, focused on practitioner development, and the impact of 'the risk society', which promotes greater surveillance of professional practice. This article reviews contemporary discussion of the practice of supervision in social work and draws on a small study that investigated the experience of six expert practitioners of professional supervision in order to explore the impact of the 'risk discourse'. These supervisors rejected a surveillance role for supervision and supported the maintenance of a reflective space as crucial to effective practice.
Management	This research addresses the competencies organizations use through project manager job advertisements. We develop a list of project manager job competencies; break down the competency components into knowledge, skills, and abilities; and conduct a comparative analysis of the use of these competencies. We examine the online contents of project manager job advertisements in the public domain. Analysis shows that industry job advertisements emphasize soft skills and competencies in a manner different than that in the literature. Additionally, differences are found across countries and between industries. Implications from the findings highlight the incongruent dissemination of project manager competencies, regional and industrial demands, and the recruitment of project managers.
Environmental Studies	This article deals with forest policy reforms in South-eastern Europe. It looks at recent developments in the forest sectors in three countries of the region, namely Slovenia, Croatia and Albania. Initial hopes that economic liberalization and democratization of these post-socialist states would alleviate environmental and sustainability problems have proven too simplistic. Rather, the transition has opened up conflicts around environment and development that begin to show only after the end of the paternalistic and planning-driven policy approaches of the socialist era. The article analyses the capacities and governance arrangements needed in post-socialist countries to deal with sustainability issues. Although the major topics in forest policy reforms in transition countries - establishment of provisions for sustainable forest management, privatization of the forest sector, strategies to reconcile sustainable forest management and sustainable economic and human development - are similar, the case studies reveal very different approaches and problems in the transformation of the sector. No blueprint for sustainable governance of forests in transition states exists. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.
Information Science & Library Science	This Libraries and Policy essay explores the interrelationships between the public library goals of supporting democracy and remaining an apolitical institution and the expectations for demonstration of value and economic contribution at a time in which public discourse emphasizes austerity from public institutions. Libraries'' positions on democracy and neutrality are explored within the context of the tension between asserting value and demonstrating it, as well as the impacts of these positions on the ability to advocate for library value in political and policy-making processes. Building upon these analyses, we examine different ways that libraries can use research to advocate and demonstrate their value by framing the terms of value and austerity in language that acknowledges the tangible and intangible contributions of public libraries.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Pedestrian and pedal cycle injuries are important causes of child morbidity and mortality. The combination of Bayesian methods and geographical distribution maps may assist public health practitioners to identify communities at high risk of injury. Data were obtained on all hospitalizations of children from NSW (Australia), for pedestrian and pedal cycle injuries, from 2000-2001 to 2004-2005. Using Bayesian methods, posterior expected rate ratios (as an estimate of smoothed standardized hospitalization ratios for each injury mechanism) were mapped by local government area (LGA) across the state. There were over 7,000 hospitalizations for pedestrian and pedal cycle injuries. High risk LGAs accounted for more than one third of hospitalized pedestrian and pedal cycle injuries in NSW. LGAs at high risk for pedestrian injury tended to be urbanized metropolitan areas with a high population density, while high risk LGAs for pedal cycle injury tended to be either in urban regional areas, or on the margin of urbanized metropolitan areas. Geospatial analyses can assist policymakers and practitioners to identify high risk communities for which public health interventions can be prioritized.
Anthropology	The present paper focuses on the archaeological, chemical and isotopic characterisation of glass finds from the Domus of Tito Macro (former Domus dei Fondi Cossar) in Aquileia (Italy), dated between the 1st and the 7th century AD. The assemblage comprises both vessels and glassworking residues, including a few chunks. Aims of the study are the identification of the main glass compositions and their contextualisation in Roman and Late Antique reference groups, and of provenance of primary glass. Chemical analyses were conducted by XRF and EPMA. All the analysed fragments are silica-soda-lime glasses, produced with natron as a flux, and are compositionally similar to the Roman coloured (intentionally and unintentionally) and colourless (antimony-, manganese-, and antimony + manganese-decoloured) groups and to the Late Antique groups HIMT, Serie 3.2 and Levantine 1. Specific compositional traits of HIMT glass circulating in the north-Adriatic area and a scarcity of Levantine 1 glass are evidenced. The presence of rare HIT blue glasses including a chunk suggests that colouring took place also at primary stage of production. Sr and Nd isotopic analyses, performed on a selection of samples, confirmed the eastern Mediterranean origin of the glasses, although with minor internal differences depending on the compositional group. Chemical and isotopic data suggest a continuity between the Roman and Late Antique glassmaking in terms of sand deposits and sand/flux ratio, although with a major change in the decolouring technique after the 4th century AD. The prompt reception of the Late Antique glass compositions took place in Aquileia alongside the persistence of earlier compositions, probably with the aim of satisfying different segments of the glass market.

Sociology	In this research I compare the motivations to enter the teaching occupation among 49 novice teachers who participated in traditional and alternative preparation programs to explore the influence of age and career stage on the decision making process. Early career entrants in both groups were more likely to cite the subject specialty as a reason to enter the occupation but only mid-career traditionally certified teachers included social concerns as a motivator. Overall, twice as many alternatively certified teachers cited the opportunity for a stable career as a motivator than did traditionally certified teachers.
Linguistics	In this insightful and reflective article, Professor Friedrich describes her journey as a student of the English language, the impact of Kachruvian linguistics on her thinking about the English language and linguistics, as well as her own relationship with the language, and her personal development as a leading scholar in the field of world Englishes.
Linguistics	Using a native speaker context completion task, this study explores the alternation between the periphrastic future, as in je vais chanter, 'I am going to sing,' and the inflected future, as in je chanterai 'I will sing.' The aim of the context completion task is to further establish the pragmatic functions of the periphrastic and inflected future in Hexagonal French, building upon the results of previous quantitative analyses (e.g. Roberts, 2012; Edmonds and Gudmestad, 2015). The results of the present native speaker questionnaire indicate that the periphrastic future denotes speaker certainty due to an awareness of previous eventualities that positively affect the realization of the future proposition while the inflected future expresses deontic modality through promises and dynamic modality through speaker willingness. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the importance of context completion tasks not only in determining the pragmatic nature of the future variants but also in testing major trends that emerge from quantitative analyses.

Women'S Studies	This study sought to determine factors associated with shelter residence in women with recent histories of intimate partner violence (IPV). The sample included 113 women, approximately half of whom resided in a shelter over the past year. Participating women provided demographic information and completed standardized measures of IPV, trauma, and depression. Ethnicity, income, housing stability, and mental health, but not violence exposure, differentiated the shelter and community groups. Trauma symptoms, housing instability, and ethnicity best predicted shelter residence. Future research should focus on determining what types of services and interventions will best address the unique needs of each population.
Industrial Relations & Labor	This article deals with the relationship between corporate strategy and human resource management (HRM) practices in France. It highlights that firms having innovation strategies differ from other companies, because they have different HRM practices. We adopt King and Anderson's definition of innovation (2002, as quoted by Lapointe et al., 2003) as meaning the introduction of a new practice, a new procedure, or a new process, at the local level, with the aim of improving the economic and social performance of the firm. We also integrate Klein and Harrisson's notion of social innovation (2006) in order to focus on the multidimensional aspect of the concept. Based on a rigorous literature review, we put forward a research model based on five major hypotheses concerning employee control/autonomy, training, remuneration, social climate and negotiation with trade unions. To test this model, we rely on the French public database called REPONSE 2011 from the French Ministry of Employment (N=3,601 respondents). We show that innovative companies are very different from others in terms of HRM. In particular, these companies have more individualized pay systems, more general objectives, and have less control over their employees (they give more autonomy at work). Innovative companies also develop more training and, furthermore, are used to discussing and negotiating more than other firms. Conversely, no significant link is reached between social climate and strategy.
International Relations	The non-use of nuclear weapons since Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 has emerged as a major puzzle in international politics. Traditional International Relations scholarship views this largely as a function of the deterrent relationship that emerged between the nuclear powers, especially during the Cold War era. The fact that nuclear weapons have not been used against non-nuclear states, despite temptations to use them, remains a challenge to the deterrence-only explanation. More normatively oriented scholars have argued that a taboo has emerged against the non-use of nuclear weapons. Nina Tannenwald's book, The Nuclear Taboo is the most comprehensive study on this subject which relies on constructivist logic of inter-subjective taboo-like prohibition in accounting for the puzzle. While I see much merit in Tannenwald's empirical case studies, it is far-fetched to call the non-use largely a function of a taboo-like prohibition. For, taboos by their very nature forbid discussions of their breaking, whereas nuclear states have national military strategies that call for nuclear use under certain circumstances. They have also in many crises situations considered the use of nuclear weapons. I have argued in my book, The Tradition of Non-use of Nuclear Weapons (Stanford University Press, 2009), that a more modest tradition can be given partial credit for the absence of nuclear attacks on non-nuclear states. The tradition emerged because of a realisation of the horrendous effects of nuclear attack (a material fact) which generated reputation costs for a potential user. These reputation costs in turn generated self-deterrence which has helped to create a tradition which is partially restraining nuclear states from using their weapons for anything other than existential deterrence. Unlike Tannenwald, I contend that the tradition is not a strict taboo and hence it can be altered if material and political circumstances compel nuclear states to do so. The recent policy changes that have taken place in nuclear powers such as the US, Russia, UK, and France do not augur well for the tradition as the conditions for atomic use have been expanded to include prevention, pre-emption and other non-proliferation objectives involving rogue states and terrorist groups.
Development Studies	The main objectives of this work are two-fold: we seek first to specify the relationship between agricultural productivity and non-agricultural employment and second to assess the effect of productivity growth on the employment of the off-farm sector in the long run. The econometric results of our panel vector autoregressive depict a causal relationship with single direction from agricultural productivity to non-agricultural employment. Between productivity and inequalities, causality seems to function only from productivity to inequalities. This explains the fact that productivity growth generates significant inequalities in the distribution of income, which is necessary to enhancing investments in the agricultural sector.

Education, Special	The purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge base regarding discipline policies in early care and education (ECE) programs by examining the extent to which programs utilize policies that reflect the implementation of evidence-based practices to prevent and address challenging behaviors in the early years. Discipline policies were gathered from 282 programs accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and were scored using the Teaching and Guidance Policy Essentials Checklist. Overall, policies failed to address evidence-base practices, and findings are situated within the discourse on the prevalence of challenging behaviors and the troubling date on preschool suspension and expulsion rates and the current ECE context.
Urban Studies	The study encompasses spatio-temporal land use/ land cover (LULC) monitoring (1989-2014) and urban growth modelling (1994-2024) of Delhi, India to deduce the past and future urban growth paradigm and its influence on varied LULC classes integrating geospatial techniques and Cellular Automata (CA). The study focused on scrutinising the reliability of the CA algorithm to function independently for urban growth modelling, provided with strong model calibration. For this purpose, satellite data of six stages of time at equal intervals along with the population density, distance to CBD and roads, and terrain slope are used. The satellite-based LULC during 1989-2014 exhibited 457 km(2) of net urban growth (275% change), cloned by the simulated LULC with net increase 448 km(2) (270% change). The spatial variation analysis using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique exhibit high similarity in classification ranging from 72% to 88%. The statistical accuracy between the satellite-based and simulated built-up extent of 2014 resulted in the overall accuracy 95.62% of the confusion matrix, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as 0.928-indication high model accuracy. The projected LULC exhibit that the urban area will increase to 708 km(2) and 787 km(2), primarily in western and eastern parts during 2019 and 2014 respectively. The rapid urban growth will replace and transform others LULC (net loss 138 km(2)) followed by vegetation cover (net loss 26 km(2)) during 2014-24. This rapid urban growth is detrimental to the habitat and may trigger critical risks to urban geo-environment and ecosystem in Delhi. Therefore, the study necessitates towards decentralization of urban functions and restoration of varied LULC in order to regulate the future urban growth patterns for sustainable development. The GDAL and NumPy libraries in Python 3.4 were efficient in spatial modelling and statistical calculations.
Family Studies	Introducing findings from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this research complements the large number of recent U. S. studies on the role of grandparents in caring for their grandchildren. For 10 continental European countries, the authors investigate cross-national variations in grandparent-provided child care as well as differences in characteristics of the providers and recipients of care. Although they find strong involvement of grandparents in their grandchildren's care across all countries, they also identify significant variations in the prevalence and intensity of care along the geographic lines of different child care and (maternal or female) employment regimes in Europe. Rooted in long-standing family cultures, the observed patterns suggest a complex interaction between welfare state-provided services and intergenerational family support in shaping the work-family nexus for younger parents. The authors conclude with a brief discussion of possible consequences of grandmothers' increasing labor force participation for child care arrangements.
Cultural Studies	One of the principal ways that cultural and higher education policy and practice intersect is over a shared concern with the supply of talent and its employability and career sustainability. This article considers the multidisciplinary contributions to these debates, and then engages with these debates by drawing upon research from analyses of national Census data, and via granular empirical survey research into Australian creative arts graduates' initial career trajectories. In so doing, it seeks to paint a more nuanced picture of graduate outcomes, the significance of creative skills and by extension creative education and training, and the various kinds of value that creative graduates add through their work. This evidence should assist in a closer affinity between the differing approaches to creative labour and the creative economy, and has implications for cultural and higher education policy.
Public Administration	In public service motivation (PSM) literature, PSM is assumed to have a positive effect on performance. Even though frequently mentioned, this assumption has proved difficult to verify empirically. In this article, we argue that individual interpretations of what it means to serve the public interest need to be considered to get a grip on the concept of PSM and its behavioral consequences. As interpretations of the public interest vary depending on the roles people occupy in society, so too does the meaning of PSM. A theoretical argument is developed that helps to clarify the meaning of PSM and its relationship with performance by introducing insights derived from identity theory. This is illustrated empirically by a study of veterinarian inspectors. The theoretical, empirical, and practical relevance of this new approach to PSM is pointed out.
Transportation	This paper introduces a methodology for designing an airline connection builder (CB) and adjusting its parameter settings. The objective of the proposed CB is to construct relevant connections that attract passenger demand while avoiding operationally infeasible and commercially irrelevant connections. Using worldwide MIDT booking data, we examined the sensitivity of CB results to the setting of the standard CB parameters maximum connection time and geographical detour. We demonstrated that CB performance can be increased by replacing these two parameters with connection lag, a measure that combines the impact of connection time with geographical detour on the total travel time of a given connection. We also found that the willingness of a passenger to book slower connections and the relationship between the number of passenger bookings and generated connections strongly depends on the O&D distance. Better results can thus be obtained by greedily determining the distance-specific CB parameter settings. The greedy adjustment of parameter settings reduces the number of unattractive connections generated, while keeping the number of covered passenger bookings high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

History Of Social Sciences	Planning of the Paris Region has a long history that began a century ago in conjunction with the global development of metropolitan planning policies. In 2013, a group of scholars working on the planning history of the Paris Region launched a series of four two-day annual international conferences entitled 'Inventer le Grand Paris/Inventing Grand Paris', which were held each December from 2013 to 2016. These conferences sought to expand the knowledge about the planning history of the Paris Region as well as to develop international comparative studies. This initiative was a reaction to the lack of historical depth in the discourse of the main actors of the Grand Paris planning process. It also sought to assemble for the first time and complete the historical research on the overall planning of the greater region, connecting it with research on other metropolitan planning histories. Beyond the conferences, a new website opened in June 2017 giving access to the proceedings but also providing a platform for sharing new historical material and research on this subject.
Gerontology	OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility and utility of a bed-side geriatric assessment (GA) to detect impairment in multiple geriatric domains in older adults initiating chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Single academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older with newly diagnosed AML and planned chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Bedside GA was performed during inpatient exmination for AML. GA measures included the modified Mini-Mental State Examination; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; Distress Thermometer, Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (includes self-reported activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and mobility questions); Short Physical Performance Battery (includes timed 4-m walk, chair stands, standing balance); grip strength, and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Of 54 participants (mean age 70.8 +/- 6.4) eligible for this analysis, 92.6% completed the entire GA battery (mean time 44.0 +/- 14 minutes). The following impairments were detected: cognitive impairment, 31.5%; depression, 38.9%; distress, 53.7%; impairment in ADLs, 48.2%; impaired physical performance, 53.7%; and comorbidity, 46.3%. Most were impaired in one (92.6%) or more (63%) functional domains. For the 38 participants rated as having good performance status according to standard oncologic assessment (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance Scale score <= 1), impairments in individual GA measures ranged from 23.7% to 50%. Significant variability in cognitive, emotional, and physical status was detected even after stratification according to tumor biology (cytogenetic risk group classification). CONCLUSION: Inpatient GA was feasible and added new information to standard oncology assessment, which may be important for stratifying therapeutic risk in older adults with AML. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:1837-1846, 2011.
Education & Educational Research	This article focuses on Spain's most recent implementing of education policies designed to address the needs of immigrant students. It overviews how the latest education policies do not meet the needs of a diverse body of students, drawing on information provided in focus group interviews from several Madrid schools, as well as from other official documents, including different manifestos and letters of rejection to some of the latest education policies. In particular, the article discusses misconceptions many educators hold about integrating immigrant students, and offers recommendations for improving the schooling of immigrant children in Spain.
Rehabilitation	Evidence Connection articles provide clinical application of systematic reviews developed in conjunction with the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-Based Practice Project. Findings from the systematic review of occupational therapy for older adults with low vision were published in the Jan uary/February 2020 issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapy (AJOT) and in AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Older Adults With Loth Vision. published in the March/April 2020 issue of AJOT. In this article, we describe a case report of an older adult with low vision who was referred to outpatient occupational therapy services because of a recent progression of her age-related macular degeneration that led to a decline in functional independence. Each article H the Evidence Connection series summarizes the evidence from the published reviews on a given topic and presents an application of the evidence to a related clinical case. These articles illustrate how the research evidence from the reviews can be used to inform and guide clinical decision making.
Anthropology	This article considers counterhegemonic sacrifices as a means of social intervention, and in doing so explores the social efficacy of non-ritual sacrifice in the modern era. Ethnographically, this article examines the way Israeli conscientious objectors succeed in having their refusal of military service and the social costs they incur understood as sacrifices by the Israeli public. Ex-soldiers accumulate social capital in light of public perception that they have `paid the price' for their beliefs. Other ethnographic contexts that further elucidate the ability of socially abject to use sacrifice to counterhegemonic effect are presented. I claim that the recognition of sacrifice depends on an intersubjective combination of sacrificial intention and community recognition. This article suggests that the meaning of sacrifice is determined by how sacrifice is used and understood in social context, and as such breaks ranks with literatures on sacrifice concerned with the intrinsic coherence of ritual sacrifice.
Development Studies	This article traces the mounting interest in, and visibility of, girls and young women in development (WID) policy, especially since the turn of the twenty-first century when a Smart Economics' rationale for promoting gender equality and female empowerment has become ever more prominent and explicit. Smart Economics', which is strongly associated with an increased influence of corporate stakeholders, frequently through public-private partnerships (PPPs), stresses a business case' for investing in women for developmental (read economic) efficiency, with investment in younger generations of women being touted as more efficient still. The latter is encapsulated in the term Smarter Economics' with the Nike Foundation's Girl Effect' being a showcase example. In this, and similar, initiatives linked with neoliberal development, investing in girls' appears to be driven not only by imperatives of female empowerment', but also to realize more general dividends for future economic growth and poverty alleviation. Yet, while it may well be that girls and young women have benefited from their rapid relocation from the sidelines towards the centre of development discourse and planning, major questions remain as to whose voices are prioritized, and whose agendas are primarily served by the current shift from Smart' to Smarter Economics'.
Ethics	Dainton and Robinson's Companion traces lines of descent of analytic philosophy from ancestors. They characterize analytic philosophy as a movement, a tradition, a style, and a commitment to the values of clarity and rigor. Critics of the ancestral movements and of analytic philosophy as such are conspicuous by their absence. The sociology of the spread of analytic philosophy is ventured, updating the original effort by Gellner.
Rehabilitation	Maternal directive and responsive behaviors were compared for 25 mothers and children with complex communication needs using two types of toys (familiar and unfamiliar toys). Each type of toy play was conducted with and without a single message speech-generating communication device (SGD) programmed to say more. Rate percentages of coded intervals for maternal directive and responsive behaviors were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. Results indicated that mothers used significantly more responsive behaviors when playing with their own familiar toys than with unfamiliar toys, but no differences in directiveness between types of play. Mothers showed no differences in responsivity or directiveness when the SGD was added to play interactions, indicating that the SGD did not introduce task features that detracted from the mothers' existing levels of responsivity with their children. Clinical implications are discussed.
Social Issues	A vexing research question concerns reciprocal relationships between social responsibility and volunteerism, characterized by volunteer identity and low volunteering cost perceived among young volunteers. This study analyzes panel data collected from 527 university students engaged in a volunteering project at a university in Hong Kong, China. Controlling for background and selectivity factors, the study reveals that the volunteer's social responsibility displayed a positive effect on volunteerism 6 months later, but volunteerism did not yield a positive effect on social responsibility 6 months later. These results imply the emphasis on social responsibility as a precursor to sustain volunteerism. They also imply the need for university to orchestrate volunteering projects that foster volunteers' volunteerism and social responsibility.
Geography	This paper explores the radical possibilities of pragmatism for geography using the illustration of arguments concerning a renewed (urban) public realm through the exchange of validity claims in communication. Pressing further the pragmatist possibilities of Habermas's idea of communicative action it draws on John Dewey's work, and a range of contemporary pragmatist philosophers, to consider human communicability in its widest sense. This is then explored using ail example of the spatiality and performativity of body-minds in a range of communicative spaces of the city. Then the paper moves on to consider the radical implications of pragmatism for geography in general in terms of body-mind/environment relations a transactional view of space; experience, rationality and radical democracy.

Cultural Studies	Recent re-conceptualizations of the public sphere' facilitated a much needed shift in thinking about identity politics from a substance ... to a movement' (Weibel and Latour, 2007). This laid the foundation for dissolving the emanatist vision' (Bourdieu, 1990) of self-explanatory and perpetual systems and structures towards the interrogation of actions and performances that simultaneously constitute and are affected by such wider socio-political realities. Most academic contributions, however, remain on a normative or theoretical level without offering empirical insights. This article introduces Mana Taonga as an Indigenous Mori concept of cultural politics embedded in current museum practice at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa). It creates a dialogue between Indigenous Mori practice and Western theory leading to a refined understanding of performative democracy within a museum as forum, or public sphere. The authors argue that a specific museum offers a particular place, space and empirical reality to interrogate seemingly universal concepts such as culture' and politics' by blending theoretical notions with an awareness of institutional contexts and practices.
Women'S Studies	Women's movements in Western Europe are not dead, but they have altered their strategies in ways that require adaptation of investigative repertoires. Recent research highlights women's movements' pathways into institutions as well as the transnationalisation of activism. This article focuses on the shifting public communication repertoire associated with these developments. Communication and movement outreach across Europe are increasingly constituted online. The authors investigate the degree to which women's networks in Germany and the UK mobilise constituencies via online means. Utilising network mapping tools as well as original data from women's NGOs, they analyse the density and distribution of relationships in German and UK networks, as well as their interactive communication repertoires as indicators of their capacity to engage constituents. The findings show that information-focused means of communication are more prevalent than interactive mobilisation tools. Women's NGOs in the UK utilise more public engagement features than those in Germany. The authors relate these findings to second-, third- and fourth-wave feminisms, focusing on their distinct mobilisation strategies.
Social Work	Previous research has established that social work practitioners are especially vulnerable to work-related psychological distress and burnout due to the high-stress nature of the profession, yet less research has focused on examining factors are associated with social worker retention. Emerging research on compassion satisfaction suggests that this factor could mitigate professional burnout, yet there is a gap in research focusing explicitly on examining compassion satisfaction among social workers. To address this gap in knowledge, this quantitative study collected survey data on practicing social workers who were alumni from a large southeastern university (n = 120) to examine individual and organizational factors associated with compassion satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses revealed that higher levels of emotional intelligence, perceived work autonomy, and perceived work-life balance were associated with an increase in compassion satisfaction among experienced, licensed social work practitioners. Findings have implications for how social work employers can promote compassion satisfaction through cultivating emotional intelligence among practitioners, allowing social workers autonomy in decision making, and providing supportive work environments. Recommended directions for future research include longitudinal studies with large sample sizes that expound research on compassion satisfaction by examining the role of additional factors, such as client population, job role characteristics, and supervisor support.
Gerontology	To test the accuracy of a brief cognitive assessment of nursing home (NH) residents and to determine whether facility nurses can reliably perform this assessment. Cross-sectional, independent cognitive screening tests with NH residents. Six Department of Veteran Affairs nursing facilities. Three hundred seventy-four residents from six regionally distributed Veteran Affairs NHs. Three cognitive assessment instruments: the Brief Interview of Mental Status (BIMS), created for this study; the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS), and the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) as the criterion standard. The 15-point BIMS tests memory and orientation and includes free and cued recall items. Research assistants administered the 3MS and BIMS to all subjects. Facility nurses administered the same BIMS to a subsample. Three hundred seventy-four of 417 (89.7%) residents approached completed the 3MS and research assistant-administered BIMS (BIMS-R); 212 residents also received a facility nurse-administered BIMS (BIMS-N). The BIMS-R was more highly correlated with the 3MS than was the CPS (Pearson correlation coefficient (r)=0.79 vs 0.62; P <.01 for difference). For the subset who received facility assessments, the BIMS-N was also more highly correlated with the 3MS (Pearson r=0.74 vs 0.65; P <.01 for difference). For any impairment (3MS < 78), the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.86 for the BIMS, versus 0.77 for the CPS. For severe impairment (3MS < 48) the AUC was 0.94, versus 0.85 for the CPS. In this population, a brief cognitive test is a more accurate approach to cognitive assessment than the current observational methods employed using the MDS 2.0.
International Relations	"Does previous experience with conventional warfare harm a military fighting an insurgency? Or, conversely, does prior experience with a counterinsurgency lower a military's likelihood for winning a conventional interstate war? Whereas firepower, maneuver, and associated tactics are essential for conventional warfare, counterinsurgency requires restrictions on firepower and effective policing in order to ""win hearts and minds."" These competing requirements for military preparedness for conventional warfare and counterinsurgency have been extensively debated. However, the consequences of fighting counterinsurgency on a state's readiness for fighting conventional wars (and vice versa) have been unexplored. We examine the relationship between past experiences with one type of conflict and war outcomes of the other type of conflict through a quantitative analysis of all wars that ended between 1838 and 2005. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that past experiences with either counterinsurgency or conventional warfare have little association with future success in war, conventional or not."
Management	Our study analyses the determinants of the gender gap in academic entrepreneurship among UK-based academics from across a wide range of academic disciplines. We focus on spinout activity as a measure of academic entrepreneurship, and explore the relevance of the different explanations for the gender gap. Our analysis is based on a unique survey of UK academics conducted in 2008/2009. The survey provides micro-data on over 22,000 academics in the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, across all higher education institutions in the UK. Our results show that female academics differ from the male academics in the sample in important ways. Female academics are more likely to be involved in applied research, to hold more junior positions, to work in the health sciences, social sciences, humanities and education, to have less prior experience of running a business, and to feel more ambivalent about research commercialisation. All of these characteristics are correlated with lower rates of spinout activity. Using a non-parametric decomposition analysis, we show that certain combinations of characteristics of male academics have few or no matches to female academics, and these characteristics explain a large proportion of the gender gap.
Linguistics	This paper presents a cross-linguistic survey of non-local allomorphy and it develops a formal model that accounts for the observed patterns. The distance between the trigger and target of allomorphy in non-local patterns is much more conservative than expected. A model of Vocabulary Insertion is developed, where the limited distance follows from the basic linear computational properties of the PF-interface.
Business	Recent advances in online game technology have set the pace for tremendous growth in the development of new entertainment applications. The authors study relationships among product capability, technology capability, perceived product innovation, user-centered design, attitude, and intention to play online games. They find that product capability, technology capability, and user-centered design influence perceived product innovation. Gamers want to interact with functional products designed with a deep understanding of customer needs. Moreover, user-centered design influences perceived product innovation, attitude toward playing, and behavioral intention to play. The study includes the user-centered design variable to reflect a unique characteristic of online games. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Emerging technological advances in genetics and neuroscience have spawned innovative or elaborated conceptual models in the field of addiction science, as well as contributed to the mushrooming of new knowledge. By addictions, reference is made to chronic, often relapsing disorders typified by obsession, compulsion or physical or psychological dependence. In this article it is proposed that a multilevel developmental contextual approach to substance use and addictions provides a useful framework for integrating existing studies across disciplines and serving as a generative guide to intriguing novel research questions. The multilevel developmental contextual approach emphasizes multiple-factor influences on substance use and addiction, the conjoint influence of variables from different levels of analysis (for example, genetic, biochemical, physiological, cognitive, social, neighborhood, societal), and dynamic, probabilistic behavior-outcome relations (that is, the occurrence as well as the nature of expression of substance problems and addiction depend on a range of emerging, interactive factors that may vary across individuals and over time). The approach is illustrated with a long-term prospective study of predictors of binge drinking from adolescence to young adulthood and a description of the role of brain processes and mechanisms involved in the development and expression of alcohol use during adolescence.

Gerontology	Using a qualitative approach, this article examines how the experiences of emotional loneliness are embedded in the everyday lives and relationships of older adults. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted in 2010 with older people who reported feeling lonely, often or all the time, during a cohort study in southern Finland. The research reveals the multifaceted nature of loneliness and its causes. Behind emotional loneliness, we identified lost and unfulfilled relationships, involving the loss or lack of a partner, the absence of a meaningful friendship, complex parenthood and troubling childhood experiences. Most of the interviewees have faced loneliness that only began in old age, but for some, loneliness has been present for nearly a lifetime.
Business, Finance	This paper develops an accountability vision using Hans-Georg Gadamer's (1975a) Truth and Method and Charles Taylor's (2016) The Language Animal and A Secular Age (2007). The paper argues accountability to beauty and nature is important to emancipating accountability, enabling the creation of a richer, encompassing narrative that is relevant to the public, with no special priority assumed for investors and creditors. The paper critiques accounting researchers' use of the methods of the natural sciences advocating 'correspondence to some presumed reality' over and against a more 'interpretivist' and mature view that truth is a property of language (see, Taylor, 2016). A transformation in accounting involves narrating and reporting corporate impacts on the natural environment while recognizing that corporate language perpetuates the logic of that particular social sphere. Through an evaluative reformulation of accounting the designative, instrumental and neoliberal framework is criticised for ignoring concepts such as beauty, intrinsic value and truth. The paper aligns with the hermeneutic-interpretivist tradition developed by Gadamer and Taylor through expressive language whether in the form of written words, speech or images to convey that nature is more than a standing reserve for consumption.

Nursing	"This is a review of lessons learned in the post-implementation evaluation of a bar-code medication administration technology implemented at a major tertiary-care hospital in 2001. In 2006, with a bar-code medication administration scan compliance rate of 82%, a near-miss sentinel event prompted review of this technology as part of an institutional recommitment to a ""culture of safety."" Multifaceted problems with bar-code medication administration created an environment of circumventing safeguards as demonstrated by an increase in manual overrides to ensure timely medication administration. A multiprofessional team composed of nursing, pharmacy, human resources, quality, and technical services formalized. Each step in the bar-code medication administration process was reviewed. Technology, process, and educational solutions were identified and implemented systematically. Overall compliance with bar-codemedication administration rose from 82% to 97%, which resulted in a calculated cost avoidance of more than $2.8 million during this time frame of the project."
Urban Studies	This study developed structural equation models (SEMs) to examine the effects of the neighborhood built environment on CO2 emissions from different trip purposes. CO2 emissions were calculated using the Travel O-D Point Intelligent Query System (TIQS) and a 2015 travel survey in Guangzhou. The results showed that there were several differences in the influence mechanism of the neighborhood built environment on CO2 emissions for different trip purposes. Most of the built environment elements tested in this study had significant effects on CO2 emissions. Certain effects were direct effects, while others were indirect effects that influenced mediating variables, such as car ownership, mode choice or trip distance. In terms of total effect, the distance to city public centers had a positive effect on CO2 emissions from commuting trips but had a negative effect on that from recreational and daily shopping trips. In contrast, residential density had a negative effect on CO2 emissions from commuting trips but had a positive effect on that from social, recreational and daily shopping trips. Bus stop density was positively correlated with CO2 emissions from commuting trips, a counterintuitive but not implausible outcome. Additionally, bus stop density had a significant negative correlation with CO2 emissions from social and daily shopping trips. In addition, land-use mix had a negative effect on CO2 emissions from commuting, social and daily shopping trips, while metro station density and road network density had significant negative effects on CO2 emissions for all trip purposes. These results suggest that it is necessary to design targeted interventions in the built environment to encourage residents to change their travel behavior, reduce CO2 emissions, and achieve low-carbon development.
Economics	I quantify the contribution of sectoral shocks to business cycle fluctuations in aggregate output. I develop and estimate a multi-industry general equilibrium model in which each industry employs the material and capital goods produced by other sectors. Using data on US industries' input prices and input choices, I find that the goods produced by different industries are complements to one another as inputs in downstream industries' production functions. These complementarities indicate that industry-specific shocks are substantially more important than previously thought, accounting for at least half of aggregate volatility.
Anthropology	The scholarly quest for the origins of metallurgy has focused on a broad region from the Balkans to Central Asia, with different scholars advocating a single origin and multiple origins, respectively. One particular find has been controversially discussed as the potentially earliest known example of copper smelting in western Eurasia, a copper 'slag' piece from the Late Neolithic to Chalcolithic site of Catalhoyuk in central Turkey. Here we present a new assessment of metal making at Catalhoyuk based on the re-analysis of minerals, mineral artefacts and high-temperature materials excavated in the 1960s by J. Mellaart and first analysed by Neuninger, Pittioni and Siegl in 1964. This paper focuses on copper-based minerals, the alleged piece of metallurgical slag, and copper metal beads, and their contextual relationship to each other. It is based on new microstructural, compositional and isotopic analyses, and a careful re-examination of the fieldwork documentation and analytical data related to the c. 8500 years old high-temperature debris at Catalhoyuk. We re-interpret the sample identified earlier as metallurgical slag as incidentally fired green pigment, which was originally deposited in a burial and later affected by a destructive fire that also charred the bones of the interred body. We also re-confirm the contemporary metal beads as made from native metal. Our results provide a new and conclusive explanation of the previously contentious find, and reposition catalhoyuk in a new narrative of the multiple origins of metallurgy in the Old World.

Industrial Relations & Labor	The term 'aesthetic labour' has come to describe the recruitment, selection, development and deployment of physical and presentational attributes geared towards 'looking good and sounding right' (Warhurst and Nickson, 2007: 104). Further research has identified a degree of stratification within interactive service work, with further distinctions developing around how particular aesthetic requirements reflect firms' brand strategies, market orientations and how they appeal to different consumer groupings - what we term, following Pettinger (2004, 2005), 'aestheticised labour'. This article presents quantitative data and analyses the prevalence, character and use of aesthetic and aestheticised labour in the Australian fashion retail industry based on a study of fashion retail stores in the central business district of Sydney, Australia. Building on previous work, it identifies that what constitutes aesthetic labour varies according to the market segment and character of the store and brand. As such it reinforces the utility of 'aestheticised labour' as a means of identifying nuances in the intensity and orientation of aesthetic labour within the retail sector.
Law	Global turmoil, historically or at present, is the cause of major and repeated movements of asylum seekers. Countries who accepts asylum seekers are acutely aware that within these movements there are individuals, albeit very few, who have engaged or who might engage in serious criminal activities. The asylum systems in these countries have processes in place to seek out these undesirable persons and ensure that they will not obtain the benefits granted to refugees while also attempting to remove them from their territory. However, the removal of asylum seekers with a possible criminal background is complicated by the fact that international law does not allow such an approach if such a person will face serious human rights violations upon his return to the country of origin. As a result, countries with persons on their territory who face this legal dilemma have explored a number of legal devices to provide a satisfactory solution to this problem. This article examines one of these approaches, namely making such asylum seekers subject to a criminal trial for the commission of serious offences. As most of the offences were committed outside the country of refuge, only countries, which employ extra-territorial jurisdiction, namely in Europe and North America, have been given attention. The article comes to the conclusion that, as a result of the legal and factual complexity of these trials, this approach does not provide a feasible answer to the problem it seeks to address.
Demography	Building on framing research and on cognitive dissonance theory, the paper examines the differentiated moderating effect of party discourse on prejudiced attitudes against immigrants. Using ESS 2002 data, the study finds that individuals who are positively oriented toward immigrants become more so when confronted with party discourses with anti-immigrant tones. This effect is, however, visible only when it comes to acceptance in one's private sphere, that is, acceptance of inter-ethnic marriage. The study also found some evidence that friendship with immigrants is not strong enough to impede natives to accept the idea of deporting unemployed immigrants.
Anthropology	The engravings of Mont Bego are traditionally classified as prewritings or proto-writings of prehistoric European area. They are not mentioned in most of the History of writing. Our assumption is that we are in the presence of writing, but traditional and non-traditional approaches of writing are formatted to correspond to certain types of writing only. So, if we consider that we are in the presence of writing, we must not start from traditional models, but we must refound a science of writing (a grammatology, in the sense that Gelb (1952) uses this term) which would be a science of integrated (or integrational) writing. Indeed, if we start from traditional concepts, we will inevitably end in a deadlock. According to traditional approaches, if we are talking about pictograms or ideograms, it means necessarily that there is a relationship with a language; in this case, we are indeed in the presence of a real writing. However, at the present state of our knowledge, we cannot make the connection with a language. If we are talking about symbols, there is no relation to a language, but we are not in the presence of a real writing, at most of a proto-writing. Here we formulate methodological proposals on the basis of which concrete analyzes can be carried out. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
Communication	STIJN REIJNDERS, MARLIES SPIJKER & JOHAN ROELAND Close encounters: ritualizing proximity in the age of celebrity For many celebrities, organizing meet-and-greets with fans and followers has become a permanent feature of their public appearances. As yet little is known about the role and importance of such meetings within the everyday constitution of celebrity culture. Why would fans be interested in the possibility of direct, personal contact with people they already know from the media? To find an answer to this question, this article presents ethnographical research into meet-and-greets with the Dutch artist Marco Borsato. Results show that these meet-and-greets constitute a special and meaningful experience for those involved. Firstly, the meet-and-greet provides a means for the fans to validate and enhance their emotional involvement with the music and with Borsato himself. Secondly, it has become clear that the meet-and-greet is a status symbol much in demand within the fan community. Thirdly, the meet-and-greet can fulfill a vital role in personal life-narratives of healing.
International Relations	This article explores a boundary condition surrounding the effect of trade interdependence on the onset of interstate conflict. In particular, we focus on the types of conflict experienced by states, including territory, policy, and regime conflicts. We draw on the MID 3.1 and Oneal and Russett's data to build three multinomial logit models to examine how trade interdependence affects territorial, policy, and regime types of conflict between 1885 and 2000. We find that trade interdependence significantly decreases the onset of all three types of conflict. This result largely holds across three different measures of trade interdependence. Moreover, we discover that the pacific effect of trade interdependence on the three types of conflict displays different patterns. Trade interdependence at the moderate and middle levels plays a marginal role in pacifying territorial and policy conflict. This effect becomes quite strong between states with high levels of interdependence. For policy conflicts, the threshold for this strong dampening effect is even higher. Finally, trade interdependence exerts a more consistent pacific impact upon regime conflict.
Substance Abuse	Background: Past studies have differentiated classes of polysubstance use in adolescence, however, the associations of adolescent polysubstance use classes with longitudinal substance use trajectories from adolescence to young adulthood have not been studied. Objective: The current study examined substance use classes during adolescence and longitudinal trajectories of each substance used across the transition to young adulthood. Method: Data were collected biennially from 662 youth and followed 10years across six measurement assessments. Using baseline data (T1), latent class analysis was used to identify classes of polysubstance use (cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug use) during adolescence. Using T2 through T6 data, we fit latent growth models for cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug use to examine longitudinal trajectories of each substance used by class. Results: A three-class model fit the data best and included a poly-use class, that had high probabilities of use among all substances, a co-use class, that had high probabilities of use among alcohol and marijuana, and a low-use class that had low probabilities of use among all substances. We then examined trajectories of each substance used by class. Strong continuity of substance use was found by class across 14years. Additionally, for some substances, higher average levels of use of at age 14 were associated with change in growth of other substances used over time. Conclusions/Importance: Efforts that only target a single drug type may be missing an important opportunity to reduce the use and subsequent consequences related to the use of multiple substances.
Environmental Studies	The portion of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna mega-basin shared between Nepal, Bhutan, northern India, and Bangladesh is one of the poorest, most densely populated, ecologically vulnerable, and socially and politically unstable areas in the world. As such, reducing the potential for transboundary water conflict by increasing cooperation between riparian states has been of increasing interest to policy-makers and foreign aid donors. The World Bank-led South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI) commenced in the mid-2000s. Yet, in more than a decade of existence, neither SAWI nor other international initiatives, have been able to improve transboundary water interactions between India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. In part this is because of the sheer complexity of transboundary water governance, and in part because of contextual factors. Addressing transboundary water issues is not a priority for the riparian states; there is significant distrust between them and resentment about India's hydro-hegemony; and bilateral, rather than multilateral, arrangements prevail. These factors make collective action both more urgent and more difficult. If they are to increase transboundary water cooperation, international actors should, among other things, resolve historical grievances; strengthen water-sharing institutions; build trust between riparian states; and work toward outcomes based on principles of water justice.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objectives. We used improved data on American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) ancestry to provide an updated and comprehensive description of cancer mortality and incidence among AI/AN populations from 1990 to 2009. Methods. We linked the National Death Index and central cancer registry records independently to the Indian Health Service (IHS) patient registration database to improve identification of AI/AN persons in cancer mortality and incidence data, respectively. Analyses were restricted to non-Hispanic persons residing in Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties in 6 geographic regions of the United States. We compared age-adjusted mortality and incidence rates for AI/AN populations with White populations using rate ratios and mortality-to-incidence ratios. Trends were described using joinpoint analysis. Results. Cancer mortality and incidence rates for AI/AN persons compared with Whites varied by region and type of cancer. Trends in death rates showed that greater progress in cancer control was achieved for White populations compared with AI/AN populations over the last 2 decades. Conclusions. Spatial variations in mortality and incidence by type of cancer demonstrated both persistent and emerging challenges for cancer control in AI/AN populations.
History & Philosophy Of Science	Multiple realization historically mandated the autonomy of psychology, and its principled irreducibility to neuroscience. Recently, multiple realization and its implications for the reducibility of psychology to neuroscience have been challenged. One challenge concerns the proper understanding of reduction. Another concerns whether multiple realization is as pervasive as is alleged. I focus on the latter question. I illustrate multiple realization with actual, rather than hypothetical, cases of multiple realization from within the biological sciences. Though they do support a degree of autonomy for higher levels of explanation and organization, they do not have the dire consequences critics of multiple realization fear.
Health Policy & Services	Objective: Enhanced HIV prevention interventions, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk individuals, require substantial investments. We sought to estimate the medical cost saved by averting 1 HIV infection in the United States. Methods: We estimated lifetime medical costs in persons with and without HIV to determine the cost saved by preventing 1 HIV infection. We used a computer simulation model of HIV disease and treatment (CEPAC) to project CD4 cell count, antiretroviral treatment status, and mortality after HIV infection. Annual medical cost estimates for HIV-infected persons, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and transmission risk group, were from the HIV Research Network (range, $1854-$4545/mo) and for HIV-uninfected persons were from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (range, $73$628/mo). Results are reported as lifetime medical costs from the US health system perspective discounted at 3% (2012 USD). Results: The estimated discounted lifetime cost for persons who become HIV infected at age 35 is $326,500 (60% for antiretroviral medications, 15% for other medications, 25% nondrug costs). For individuals who remain uninfected but at high risk for infection, the discounted lifetime cost estimate is $96,700. The medical cost saved by avoiding 1 HIV infection is $229,800. The cost saved would reach $338,400 if all HIV-infected individuals presented early and remained in care. Cost savings are higher taking into account secondary infections avoided and lower if HIV infections are temporarily delayed rather than permanently avoided. Conclusions: The economic value of HIV prevention in the United States is substantial given the high cost of HIV disease treatment.
Public Administration	While a growing body of research argues for increased attention to ethics within public administration, scholars diverge on how to conceptualize the character of public ethics. Likewise, empirical evidence regarding the role that ethics plays in the quality of service delivery is rare. The author argues that the concept of a public ethics of care is useful for public administration in welfare states. She examines the idea empirically through a large-N analysis of frontline bureaucrats within the Swedish Social Insurance Administration. The analysis develops two general measures of a public ethics of care as well as a public ethics of justice. The author proceeds to show a clear presence of an ethics of care in the Swedish public sector. Further, analysis shows that these two ethics measures are supplementary, not contradictory, and that age is the main individual determinant behind ethics of care, strongly correlating with number of years in office. The conclusion underscores how public ethics of care results from acquired experience in fulfilling care-oriented tasks.
Sociology	This article proposes a more culturalist and variegated conception of the individual than that presented by individualization theorists. Inspired by the approach of the individual advocated by Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons and John Meyers, it first outlines the general script of the individual-as-actor that informs modern individualism as well as the generic characteristics that are routinely attributed to persons such as agency and free will. It subsequently reconstructs three predominant interpretations of this general script, i.e. utilitarian, moral and expressive individualism. For each variant, the intellectual genesis and overall definition of the institutionalization in specific societal domains and the dominant articulations in social theory are briefly presented. With this threefold distinction, the aim is to synthesize the extensive literature on individualism and to show the sociological strengths of approaching subjectivity in terms of institutionalized scripts.
Geography	Environmental justice (EJ) scholarship is increasingly framing justice in terms of capabilities. This paper argues that capabilities are fundamentally about well-being and as such there is a need to more explicitly theorize well-being. We explore how capabilities have come to be influential in EJ and how well-being has been approached so far in EJ specifically and human geography more broadly. We then introduce a body of literature from social psychology which has grappled theoretically with questions about well-being, using the insights we gain from it to reflect on some possible trajectories and challenges for EJ as it engages with well-being.
Urban Studies	Governance-beyond-the-state has been widely adopted in urban politics in recent decades of global neoliberalism. However, how the governance change actually takes place in the planning system needs careful substantiation and contextualisation. By applying the 'levels of governance' concept, this paper examines diverse factors of governance innovation with a reference to the recent participatory urban regeneration policy in South Korea. Through multi-scalar analysis of the comparative case studies of three districts in the city of Daegu, we explain a combination of various factors at the local level that has a significant influence on governance innovation. We also highlight that governance innovation is engendered on the basis of the material and relational resources available at other spatial scales and involves multi-scalar institutional restructuring. This multi-scalar dimension would broaden our understanding of what makes governance change possible and how it takes place.
Social Work	This longitudinal study examined the influence of parenting behaviors, well-being, and risk factors of low-income adolescent mothers on the cognitive and language abilities of children from infancy to age 3. Participants consisted of 1,240 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project. Data were collected using structured interviews with the mothers and from videotaped mother-child interactions during play activities when children were approximately 14 months old and again at 36 months of age. Positive parenting behaviors exhibited toward the 14-month-old children predicted gains in both cognitive and language abilities more so than did maternal well-being, risk factors within the family setting, and demographic risk factors. Gains in cognitive abilities from infancy to age 3 were predicted by supportive parenting, higher family resources, and lower family conflict when children were infants. Gains in language abilities were predicted by supportive parenting, support for language and learning in the home environment, and higher family resources when children were infants. Finally, path analyses showed that maternal age had an indirect effect on child cognitive and language abilities at age 3 through effects on parenting behaviors. Older mothers were more likely to be supportive during play at age 14 months, which in turn promoted enhanced developmental outcomes at age 3. Implications for intervention and future research are discussed.
Social Work	In this article, the authors responded to nine commentaries by 17 contributors to their article, Issues in Differential Response. The authors found that a majority of the respondents agreed with the major conclusions of Issues in Differential Response. However, there were varying degrees of disagreement regarding the significance of some of the article's conclusions. The authors point out and discuss the considerable divergence in the respondents' definitions of differential response (DR), their assessment of DR reform's empirical support, and their assessment of its potential for progressive development as an evidence-informed model for child welfare practice. The authors conclude that research claims and public belief regarding DR reform's safety and effectiveness exceed its scientific support, and they make suggestions for improving model building and outcome research for DR reform.
Education, Special	"The purpose of this study was to examine the use of brief experimental analysis (BEA) to identify early reading interventions for students in the primary grades and to compare teachers"" judgments about their students"" early reading intervention needs to BEA results. In addition, the research was conducted to explore how teachers make decisions regarding early reading intervention selection and evaluation. Three teachers and three elementary students (two kindergarten and one second grade) participated in the study. A BEA using a multielement design with mini-reversals was used to test the effects of four different interventions. Each teacher selected an intervention that she judged to be the most promising for her student. An extended analysis using an alternating treatments design compared the relative effects of the BEA-identified intervention and the teacher-identified intervention across time. The teachers were interviewed before and after selecting and implementing the interventions. The extended analysis results showed that the BEA-identified intervention was more effective than the teacher-identified intervention for all participants. Initial and final interview findings revealed that the teachers reported using data to make intervention decisions, but with limited specificity and in some cases, misjudgments. The results are discussed in regard to limitations and future research."
Transportation	The article illustrates the results of a research project aimed at identifying the main economic and industrial characteristics of the port system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region, Italy, and the role it plays within the economy. Combining a top-down and bottom-up approach, based on interviews and detailed data at firm level, a bi-regional input-output (I-O) table is built with a special disaggregation of the 12 port-related sectors of the FVG region. The I-O table provides the basis for the estimation of a bi-regional I-O model. Drawing from the I-O literature, the article also implements two methodologies to estimate: (a) the level of self-sufficiency of the port system and (b) its degree of substitutability, that is, what would happen if the FVG port system closes down, completely or partially.
Family Studies	Regular family meal times have been associated with enhanced family cohesion and positive developmental outcomes for children-youth, especially in White and/or middle-class families. Less is known about the meal time experiences of low-income African American families. Guided by a family resilience perspective, this study examines meal times among a sample of low-income African American caregivers of preschoolers in an inner-city neighborhood. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews and a photo elicitation interview with 11 low-income African American caregivers about their family meal time experiences. We found that caregivers valued family meal times and acknowledged their benefits for family life. However, competing demands such as family schedules, household configurations, chores, time pressures, fast food restaurants, and low-wage work affected the schedule and structure of meal times. This study adds to discussions of family meal times among low-income African American families and provides suggestions for enhancing mealtimes through culturally and developmentally appropriate interventions.
Economics	We study the response of real wages to the business cycle in eight major Eurozone countries before and during the Great Recession. Average real wages are found to be acyclical, but this reflects, in large part, the effect of changes in the composition of the labour force related to unemployment variations over the cycle. Using longitudinal micro data from the ECHP and SILC panels to control for composition effects, we estimate the elasticities of real wage growth to unemployment increases between -0.6 and -1 over the period 1994-2011. Composition effects have been particularly large since 2008, and they explain most of the stagnation or increase in the average wage observed in some countries from 2008 to 2011. In contrast, at a constant labour force composition in terms of education and experience, the figures indicate a significant decrease in average wages during the downturn, particularly in countries most affected by the crisis. Overall, there is no evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity during the Great Recession in most countries in our sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Education, Special	Response-to-intervention (RTI) systems posit that Tier 1 consists of high-quality general classroom instruction using evidence-based methods to address the needs of most students. However, data on the extent to which general education teachers provide such instruction are rarely collected. This missing instructional data problem may result in RTI decisions being made without sufficient evidence. Recent advancements in the conceptualization and measurement of opportunity-to-learn (OTL) can operationalize and assess key aspects of Tier 1 instruction in ways that are scalable and formative for teacher practice. In this article, we provide a rationale for collecting and using OTL data via an online teacher log called MyiLOGS (My Instructional Learning Opportunities Guidance System). We summarize three MyiLOGS studies focusing on general and special education classrooms and students with and without disabilities. We conclude by contextualizing these studies' findings for purposes of Tier 1 instructional data collection and discuss the need for future research.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The relative performance of the maximum likelihood ( ML) and weighted least square mean and variance adjusted ( WLSMV) estimators was investigated by studying differential item functioning ( DIF) with ordinal data when the latent variable (.) was not normally distributed. As the ML estimator, ML with robust standard errors ( labeled MLR in Mplus) was chosen and implemented with 2 link functions ( logit vs. probit). The Type I error and power of x(2) tests were evaluated under various simulation conditions including the shape of the. distributions for the reference and focal groups. Type I error was better controlled with MLR estimators than WLSMV. The error from WLSMV was inflated when there was a large difference in the shape of the. distribution between the 2 groups. In general, the power remained quite stable across different distribution conditions regardless of the estimators. WLSMV and MLR-probit showed comparable power, whereas MLR-logit performed the worst.
Sociology	The paper conceptualizes and quantifies effects of improving adequacy in the minimum income scheme in Slovakia. It builds on previous findings on its significant shortcomings and discusses them in relation to the ideas of activation, active inclusion and social investments. The core of the paper is based on microsimulation of effects of proposed reform scenarios. Three major changes of minimum income scheme's parameters are explored: setting new amounts of minimum income benefit, introducing guaranteed amounts in the minimum income scheme, and change of equivalence scale. The effects are identified in terms of poverty rate, poverty gap, size of target population and budget requirements. Results serve as a basis for discussion on future reforms of the minimum income scheme in Slovakia.
Anthropology	The acts of armed violence can pour a new sense over the spaces where a community build its social identity. In Nueva Venecia, a small pile-dwelling village in Magdalena (Colombia), three different armed actors (the guerrilla, the right-wing paramilitaries and the Public Force) gathered the local people, at three different times, on the same social space: the main square. In the first meeting, people was warned, by the first one of the three groups, about the possibility of a slaughter that could happen there. In the second occasion, local people was both victim and witness of the way that the second one carried it on. In the third meeting, the third group offered excuses for what happened. The paper analyses the way in which these three acts determined three marks of the continuum of violence over the local nodal space of memory. The article is organized around the last act, when national Army and Police representatives organized a public ceremony of forgiveness because of the paramilitary massacre. The study of such a ceremony shows it as a stage where agents of confronting memories are trying to achieve social legitimacy rather than a true act of symbolic reparation.
Gerontology	Objectives To determine the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in individuals aged 70 and older in a rural African community. Design Community-based cross-sectional survey. Setting A demographic surveillance site (DSS) within the rural Hai district of northern Tanzania. Participants Approximately one-quarter (N=2,232) of the population aged 70 and older of the DSS. Measurements Participants were screened for AF using 12-lead electrocardiography; demographic and 1-year mortality data were collected; and functional status, body mass index, and blood pressure were recorded. The sex-specific prevalence of AF in each 5-year age band was determined. Results Fifteen of 2,232 participants (12 women, 3 men) had AF, giving a crude prevalence rate of 0.67% (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.331.01) and an age-adjusted prevalence of 0.64% (95% CI=0.310.97). Prevalence was 0.96% (95% CI=0.421.49) in women and 0.31% (95% CI=-0.04 to 1.24) in men. Prevalence increased with age, from 0.46% (95% CI=0.010.90) in those aged 70741.30% (95% CI=0.172.42) in those aged 85 and older. One-year mortality was 50% in women and 66.6% in men. Conclusions This is the first published community-based AF prevalence study from sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence rate of AF is strikingly lower than in other elderly populations studied, yet the 1-year mortality rate was exceedingly high.
Ethnic Studies	In recent years, the place of Islam in Western European society has become a central political issue, particularly on the far right of the ideological spectrum. Parties as diverse as the Schweizerische Volkspartei (SVP), the Lega Nord, the Dansk Folkeparti and the Vlaams Belang have mobilized against the 'Muslim invasion', launching campaigns against the building of mosques and minarets, the integration of Muslim immigrants and the recognition of Islam as a religion of equal status. Betz and Meret discuss how parties such as the SVP have framed the question of Islam in terms of culture, values and identity. This has allowed them to put themselves forward as defenders of fundamental liberal values, such as individualism, secularism and gender equality. Betz and Meret also advance an analytical framework that might allow us to put contemporary Islamophobia in Western Europe in a larger historical and transnational context. Their central argument is that the current political mobilization against the 'Islamization' of Western European societies is part of a larger 'quest' for a European identity.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) from 2014-15 includes a partial repetition of the immigration module from the first ESS wave (2002-03) with information on individual attitudes toward immigration and immigrants in both old and new immigration societies. The goal of the present study is to test whether and to what extent questions in the module are equivalent across ESS countries. We performed two types of measurement equivalence tests: exact and approximate. Whereas the exact approach requires that measurement parameters are exactly equal across groups, the approximate and newer approach suggests that it is sufficient that measurement parameters are approximately equal to allow a meaningful comparison across groups. Our findings suggest that two measurement scales, opposition toward immigration and realistic threat, are approximately invariant across most ESS countries and this allows the comparison of both associations with other theoretical constructs of interest and means.
Development Studies	There is a flurry of research activity surrounding the Transition Movement, yet no previous inquiry has examined the movement's political economy. This investigation fills this gap in scholarship by analysing the movement's localization agenda and gives particular emphasis to the implications for political relations between community members and with local governments. Through direct participation with the movement and interviews with Transition activists in the United States, a theoretical picture of an economically and socially localized future is offered. However, when theory is translated into practice, a point of internal tension - functional independence versus government institutionalization - is created in the movement's development strategy. The paper identifies and evaluates a politically active subset of the movement that is seeking to more effectively accelerate and expand the localization process by directly influencing policy making and implementation though local governments. Whereas this heightened level of political activity suggests that some Transition groups are being drawn towards institutionalization, it creates new areas of potential tension. Specifically, if the Transition Movement continues to integrate its political economy into the local community through institutionalized policy making and implementation power, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain and justify its traditional identity as a non-political and socially inclusive movement that avoids divisive political conflict.
Transportation	We consider planning and design of an extended supply chain for bioenergy networks (i.e., networks for multibiomass as well as biofuel logistics) in an integrated fashion while simultaneously addressing strategic and tactical decisions pertaining to location, production, inventory, and distribution in a multiperiod planning horizon setting. In our modeling, we also explicitly incorporate realistic operational parameters, including biomass deterioration rates and transportation economies of scale. For an efficient solution of our model, we suggest a Benders decomposition-based algorithm that can handle realistic size problems for design and analysis purposes. We implement the approach in a particular way using callback functions, in which the master problem is solved only once; we also develop surrogate constraints for enhanced lower bounds to obtain improved convergence especially for large instances. We provide computational results that demonstrate the efficiency of the solution approach on a wide-ranging set of problem instances. Furthermore, we develop a realistic case using data pertaining to the state of Texas and conduct an extensive analysis on the effects of varying input parameters on the design outcomes for a bioenergy supply chain network.
Education, Special	Sleep problems are a common occurrence among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition to the adverse effects that sleep problems present for children's neurodevelopment, learning, and daytime behaviors, these sleep problems also present significant challenges for the entire family. This article outlines the results of a comprehensive review of behavioral intervention literature to address sleep problems in young children with ASD using the National Autism Center (NAC) criteria. Results indicate that a variety of antecedent- and consequence-based interventions have been evaluated with young children with ASD to address sleep disturbances. The empirical strength of the literature reviewed reveals an emerging evidence base. These findings suggest the need for more research evaluating behavioral interventions with young children with ASD to contribute to best practices for early childhood special educators and practitioners working with these children.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Objective: The most effective way to reduce the number of expected victims and amount of damage from earthquakes is by effective preparedness. The Israeli government launched a national campaign to change its citizens' behavior. This study assessed the effectiveness of the campaign on the Israeli population. Methods: The survey was conducted 2 weeks after the campaign ended. It was based on a randomly selected representative sample of the adult Israeli population. Results: Of the 42% of the Israeli public exposed to the campaign, 37% estimated that a strong earthquake might occur in Israel during the coming years. Only 23% of those who were exposed to the campaign (9% of the Israeli public) said that the campaign improved their awareness; 76% reported that after their exposure to the campaign they did nothing to prepare. However, exposure to the campaign significantly increased the knowledge of dealing with earthquakes (30% vs 21% among those not exposed). Conclusions: Although the campaign increased knowledge and awareness, it did not achieve the goal of improving public preparedness. The campaign was not effective by itself, and it should be part of a multiyear activity.
Ethnic Studies	Wilson's article examines how apocalyptic thinking converges with the use of conspiracy theory in white nationalist world-views at a time of crisis. Apocalyptic thinking is, typically, a religious response to secular threats to the faith community that prophesize, or are attendant on, the End. These millenarian outlooks provide communities in crisis a promise of confirmation of the object of their faith, the vanquishing of enemies and, crucially, continuity for the community in a better world to come. In the latter half of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty-first, apocalypticism and conspiracy theory have tended to coincide. The tendency towards a binary distinction between terms of absolute good and absolute evil, and the revelation of secrets relating to human destiny through prophesy or truth-seeking' provide a broad transposability between the two interpretative strategies. An increasing amalgamation of political paranoia and eschatology have given rise to what has been termed conspirituality'. Much recent white nationalist rhetoric can be understood as emerging from this discursive position, and Wilson's analysis will demonstrate how one white nationalist community drew on conspiratorial apocalypticism in its response to the multiple attacks by Islamic State in Paris on 13-14 November 2015.
Information Science & Library Science	Identifying all published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is an important aim, but it requires extensive manual effort to separate RCTs from non-RCTs, even using current machine learning (ML) approaches. We aimed to make this process more efficient via a hybrid approach using both crowdsourcing and ML. We trained a classifier to discriminate between citations that describe RCTs and those that do not. We then adopted a simple strategy of automatically excluding citations deemed very unlikely to be RCTs by the classifier and deferring to crowdworkers otherwise. Combining ML and crowdsourcing provides a highly sensitive RCT identification strategy (our estimates suggest 95%-99% recall) with substantially less effort (we observed a reduction of around 60%-80%) than relying on manual screening alone. Hybrid crowd-ML strategies warrant further exploration for biomedical curation/annotation tasks.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	In this study, we investigate whether mobile device use in surveys can be predicted. We aim to identify possible motives for device use and build a model by drawing on theory from technology acceptance research and survey research. We then test this model with a Structural Equation Modeling approach using data of seven waves of the GESIS panel. We test whether our theoretical model fits the data by focusing on measures of fit, and by studying the standardized effects of the model. Results reveal that intention to use a particular device can predict actual use quite well. Ease of smartphone use is the most meaningful variable: if people use a smartphone for specific tasks, their intention to use a smartphone for survey completion is also more likely. In conclusion, investing in ease of use of mobile survey completion could encourage respondents to use mobile devices. This can foremost be established by building well-designed surveys for mobile devices.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Small, immigrant-owned businesses, such as auto repair shops and nail salons, often face barriers to environmental and occupational health compliance and may be a source of neighborhood pollution complaints. The Boston Public Health Commission established the Safe Shops Project to improve safety and environmental practices in such businesses using a community partnership model that incorporates enforcement inspection findings, worker training, technical assistance, and referral to health care and business resources. This integrated technical assistance approach has led to improved occupational health and environmental conditions, adoption of pollution prevention technologies, novel problem-solving, and dozens of health screenings and insurance referrals for workers and their neighbors.

Rehabilitation	Purpose: The Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool is a common patient reported outcome used to assess those with Chronic Ankle Instability. However, paper versions of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool have only been assessed for reliability purposes. The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement and reliability of a digital version of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool-Digital. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight participants with a history of ankle sprain(s) were recruited to participate in this study. Participants completed a paper version of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and a digital version then returned one week later and completed them again. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kappa coefficients were used to determine the agreement between the paper and digital versions as well as test-retest reliability between the two time periods. Results: The digital version showed excellent reliability (ICC = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89?0.96) with the paper version. The test-retest reliability between testing sessions was considered good (ICC = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77?0.92). A majority of individual items on the digital version demonstrated substantial agreement (??=?0.60?0.81) with the paper version. Conclusions: A digital version of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool demonstrated good to excellent psychometric properties. Clinicians who utilize a digital version as part of an electronic medical record system can utilize them confidently to accurately assess patients with Chronic Ankle Instability. Future studies may want to consider assessing a digital version with expanded clinical and research populations.
Urban Studies	Since the early 1980s, scholars have debated whether or not the converging forces of globalization have disembedded city-regions from their national contexts. This study explored this question through a comparison of post-1990 growth trends in the Detroit and Greater Toronto Area-Hamilton regions (GTAH), two urban areas within the same natural region and closely linked by industrial production flows, yet politically situated within two separate Federalist states. Guided by Nested City Theory, it reveals how their dissimilar contexts for race, local autonomy, and multilocal planning have helped foster divergent spatial patterns in the two regions. In particular, provincial controls governing municipal fragmentation, Ontario's Planning Act, and subregional/microregional planning have been key embedded structures helping to limit population decline and disinvestment in GTAH core cities. In the process, this article shows how urban trajectories have remained nested within multilevel spatial and institutional configurations. Its findings also call for greater consideration of nested state/provincial factors in cross-national comparisons of cities within Federal states. Finally, its conclusion offers a starting point toward a more nuanced specific version of Nested Theory to be called the Contextualized Model of Urban-Regional Development.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Systems biology is currently one of the most prominent large-scale endeavours in the life sciences, so it might be considered to be a good example of 'big science'. Further analysis shows, however, that although systems biology does make use of huge quantities of data, requires large amounts of funding and is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, in other respects it does not fit comfortably under the heading of big science. I suggest that we need to adopt new policy categories if we want to understand the dynamics of the contemporary life sciences. The term 'New Biology' has been used to identify recent changes. New Biology involves the integration of many different disciplines, and, importantly, it is oriented towards addressing major societal needs or 'grand challenges'. I ask: if 'big science' was the language of the twentieth century, are 'grand challenges' the language of the twenty first? I end by arguing for the increased involvement of the social sciences and humanities in the formulation of grand challenges.
Development Studies	In response to slow and ineffective agrarian reform in South Africa, an integrated and inclusive rural economy is proposed through the active engagement of a capable and developmental state. This noble-sounding official ambition raises concerns of potential authoritarian populism. Through a review of recent agrarian polices and strategies in the dimensions of policy development, management and intergovernmental relations, we find that the concept of policy-driven institutional incoherence in the local provision of public goods frames the growing evidence of corruption, elite capture and exclusion better. Two cases from within local government illustrate further how unclarity or incoherencies in the rules-in-use are driven by ill-defined mandates, overlapping jurisdictions, incomplete implementation or contradictions between policies.
Women'S Studies	Early in the course of undertaking empirical research on the sexual diversity of the judiciary I had to address a particular challenge. Sexuality, I was repeatedly told, is not and ought not to be a difference that is taken into account. At best it ought to be disregarded or taken out of consideration. This generated a number of challenges for my research. How do you research and make sense of sexuality as a difference that key informants assert is absent or seek to make invisible and irrelevant? How do you research the operation and effects of that which is not to be spoken about? How do you research the sexual norm when its existence and operation is denied? This article explores one response. It is a project that may for some be surprising and unexpected. It is a study of judicial portraits. Drawing on the insights of queer theory and art historical scholarship on portraits I undertake a textual analysis of these images, focusing upon the aesthetic and artistic traditions used to make them. A small case study of portraits of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales is used to explore how, if at all, sexuality figured in these portraits.
Gerontology	This paper undertakes a comprehensive review of the growing international literature on the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) among older people. Issues associated with access and adoption of ICTs among older people living in rural communities will be explored, drawing on social capital as a theoretical lens through which to identify how these new technologies can build healthy ageing. ICTs as bridging social capital can address some of the challenges of service provision in rural Australia and provide access to more extensive information and resources. ICTs can also contribute to bonding social capital through access to other forms of communication to build on local connectedness. However, rural, older people face particular challenges of access, which may exacerbate the cycle of rural social exclusion. In the context of the Australian National Broadband rollout, it is timely to consider how some of these disparities can be addressed.
Development Studies	The article poses questions about astronomy and its local, national and global developmental impacts, drawing on ongoing research around the internationally networked Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope in South Africa. The relationship between progress in global science and technology and societal change has traditionally been framed through western-centric notions of progress imbued with universalism; the field of astronomy exemplifies this approach, with its assumptions of an inherently positive correlation between its science and loosely defined notions of development'. We problematise this assumption through an analysis of the multiple notions of development at different scales of analysis in the SKA. We argue that large astronomy projects such as the SKA are best understood as dense assemblages of science, infrastructure, human agency and politics, in which historically rooted local concerns are marginalised in the name of the national or global public interest.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article recasts a critical moment in the history of HIV/AIDS in South Africa: the struggle over the science of HIV that emerged under former South African President Mbeki (1999-2008). It compares how the Mbeki administration and prominent South African AIDS organisation, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) responded to the dominant scientific model of HIV/AIDS. Contrary to existing research, which presents the government and TAC's positions as polarised, this article draws attention to some important commonalities in their understandings of HIV. I argue that both parties were doing the 'boundary-work' of science (Gieryn, 1995, p. 404): tussling over the demarcation between science and non-science in order to assert the 'truth' about HIV/ AIDS. In so doing, they constitute HIV as a biologically self-evident disease possessed of intrinsic attributes. The article draws on science studies and new materialist scholarship to query this conventional view and its presumption that disease is a static object that precedes political processes and practices. It argues instead that disease is made through politics and it traces some significant political practices that have contributed to making HIV/AIDS in South Africa in specific, sometimes damaging ways.
Business	"This research examines the implications of telling an ""innocent"" white lie after a negative interpersonal encounter. We propose that if a white lie falls outside an acceptable range of dishonesty, cognitive dissonance will arise and produce negative affect. Deceivers will then be motivated to reduce the dissonance and will do so by engaging in behaviors that favor the wrongdoer with potentially negative consequences for the self. We test our conceptualization across three studies. In study 1, we explore the impact of one factor that determines whether a white lie falls outside the acceptable range of dishonesty-the salience of the norm of honesty. In studies 2 and 3, we examine the role of two factors, affect certainty and source certainty, that are predicted to moderate the impact of the negative affect on deceiver's downstream judgments and behaviors toward the target of the white lie."
Social Issues	As discussions in Congress shift from debating the causes of climate change to examining solutions to address it, increasing attention is being paid to the research that supports these decisions. In particular, the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), which funds approximately 1.5 billion dollars in R&D in 13 government agencies, has come under scrutiny, and several efforts are under way to refocus its research portfolio to emphasize information relevant to policymakers.
Business	The purpose of this research is to examine how perceived food healthfulness and package partitioning interact to impact intended and actual consumption. Across three studies, findings indicate that both intended consumption and actual consumption of the perceptually healthier food items increase when packaging is not partitioned. Further, partitioning does not change the intended or actual consumption of foods perceived as less healthy. Accordingly, perceptually healthy foods tend to be consumed more when servings are not partitioned, suggesting a positive health halo leading to a healthy = eat more consumption pattern. The role of affect regulation theory and, more specifically, guilt, in this process is examined. These findings have implications for marketers, food manufacturers, and public policymakers interested in reducing obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Law	Although historical debates about the separation of powers focus on Congress, the President, and the Judiciary, in modern times, the bureaucracy is the elephant in the room. In a world of seemingly inevitable widespread congressional delegation to administrative agencies, as well as the Supreme Court's blessing of independent agencies, how exactly is the fourth branch of government to be controlled? The canonical answer in administrative law, constitutional law, and political science, is agency design. By carefully selecting structural features of administrative agencies and requiring the use of specific decision-making procedures for policy making, the legislature and the executive can ensure responsive and accountable bureaucracy-or so the argument goes. As Congress continues to create ever more agencies using ever more variations in institutional structure, and as the Supreme Court continues to grapple with which features of administrative are constitutional, the stakes of these conceptual debates have risen steadily. Indeed, we are in the midst of something of an agency design renaissance-a time period of fundamental change with respect to the federal bureaucracy-deriving mainly, although not exclusively, from the emergence of new administrative forms. Unfortunately, there is virtually no empirical scholarship that demonstrates a link between agency design and political responsiveness or agency behavior. This is due not to a lack of attention but to a fundamental problem of research design and the institutional landscape of administrative agencies. To address this question, scholars have studied individual agencies to document political influence exerted by Congress or the president in a specific policy domain. Such studies of individual agencies are important, but also analytically incapable of identifying the role of agency design in political responsiveness for two reasons. First, the relevant institutional features almost never vary within a single agency. Second, most policy outputs-where one would look to see evidence of political control-are not readily comparable across agencies. As a consequence, there has been little quantitative scholarship that establishes a link between agency design and a similar agency output across agencies or over time. This Essay focuses on an activity common to and comparable across many agencies-the distribution of federal moneys-to answer one of the most basic questions for agency design. We show that a prominent structural feature of agency design - the extent of high-level personnel politicization-affects the degree of political responsiveness by agencies
Law	During the twentieth century, thousands of new cities took shape across America. Stucco subdivisions sprawled and law followed, enabling suburbs to adopt independent governments. That story is familiar. But meanwhile, something else was also happening. A smaller but sizable number of cities were dying, closing down their municipal governments and returning to dependence on counties. Some were ghost towns, emptied of population. In those places, jobs were lost and families struggled; crops died off and industries moved on. Other dead cities were humming with civic life: places with people but no longer with separate governments. In these cities, citizens from the political left and right, often in coalition, rose up to eliminate their local governments. As an end in itself, understanding these changes would be worthwhile. But this past has not passed. Unprecedented numbers of cities and citizens are currently considering disincorporation in response to economic crisis and population loss. The dissolution law to which they are turning, as it is written in state codes and as it is understood in theory, is immature and thin. Cities' experiences with dissolution are unknown, constraining our ability to judge the values it serves or undermines. If dissolution is to grow in importance as part of the legal machinery of urban decline, we must understand what it meant in the decades that came before. Dissolving Cities tells the story of municipal dissolution. It is an article of law, theory, and urban history a reminder that urban growth and local government fragmentation, which have long dominated academic discourse on cities, may not be the upward ratchet we have assumed them to be. Cities can die, and when they do, they raise critical questions about decline, governance, taxes, race, and community.
Gerontology	"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Although several approaches have been developed to provide comprehensive care for persons living with dementia (PWD) and their family or friend caregivers, the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of community-based dementia care (CBDC) versus health system-based dementia care (CBDC) and the effectiveness of both approaches compared with usual care (UC) are unknown. DESIGN Pragmatic randomized three-arm superiority trial. The unit of randomization is the PWD/caregiver dyad. SETTING Four clinical trial sites (CTSs) based in academic and clinical health systems. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2,150 English- or Spanish-speaking PWD who are not receiving hospice or residing in a nursing home and their caregivers. INTERVENTIONS Eighteen months of (1) HSDC provided by a nurse practitioner or physician""s assistant dementia care specialist who works within the health system, or (2) CBDC provided by a social worker or nurse care consultant who works at a community-based organization, or (3) UC with as needed referral to the Alzheimer""s Association Helpline. MEASUREMENTS Primary outcomes: PWD behavioral symptoms and caregiver distress as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Severity and Modified Caregiver Strain Index scales. Secondary outcomes: NPI-Q Distress, caregiver unmet needs and confidence, and caregiver depressive symptoms. Tertiary outcomes: PWD long-term nursing home placement rates, caregiver-reported PWD functional status, cognition, goal attainment, time spent at home, Dementia Burden Scale-Caregiver, a composite measure of clinical benefit, Quality of Life of persons with dementia, Positive Aspects of Caregiving, and cost effectiveness using intervention costs and Medicare claims. RESULTS The results will be reported in the spring of 2024. CONCLUSION D-CARE will address whether emphasis on clinical support and tighter integration with other medical services has greater benefit than emphasis on social support that is tied more closely to community resources. It will also assess the effectiveness of both interventions compared with UC and will evaluate the cost effectiveness of each intervention."
History & Philosophy Of Science	The notion of fitness is usually equated to reproductive success. However, this actualist approach presents some difficulties, mainly the explanatory circularity problem, which have lead philosophers of biology to offer alternative definitions in which fitness and reproductive success are distinguished. In this paper, we argue that none of these alternatives is satisfactory and, inspired by Mumford and Anjum's dispositional theory of causation, we offer a definition of fitness as a causal dispositional property. We argue that, under this framework, the distinctiveness that biologists usually attribute to fitness-namely, the fact that fitness is something different from both the physical traits of an organism and the number of offspring it leaves-can be explained, and the main problems associated with the concept of fitness can be solved. Firstly, we introduce Mumford and Anjum's dispositional theory of causation and present our definition of fitness as a causal disposition. We explain in detail each of the elements involved in our definition, namely: the relationship between fitness and the functional dispositions that compose it, the emergent character of fitness, and the context-sensitivity of fitness. Finally, we explain how fitness and realized fitness, as well as expected and realized fitness are distinguished in our approach to fitness as a causal disposition.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This paper examines the impact of corruption on the number of tourist inflows to Turkey from 70 countries for the period from 1996 to 2014. For this purpose, it is the first paper to examine the effects of not only the absolute corruption but also the relative corruption on the tourist arrivals in the literature. By using the fixed effects, the generalized methods of moments, and the Hausman-Taylor estimations, we find that level of the relative corruption negatively affects the inbound tourism to Turkey.
Environmental Studies	This paper surveys the natural resource curse. We review the mechanisms through which resource wealth might slow economic growth, and the empirical studies that test for an effect overall, or on factors associated with growth. We include more recent studies suggesting the resource curse reflects only empirical misspecification. After reflecting on this conflicting evidence, and the findings of other recent surveys, we argue the evidence that resource dependence negatively affects growth remains convincing, particularly working through factors closely associated with growth in developing countries. Recent contrarian studies demonstrate that future research should better address endogeneity of dependence measures, and expand the years of study and range of empirical methodologies used.
Geography	Over the past few decades, land use and land cover change has become a global concern. In the Lop Buri province of Thailand, rapid land cover change, specifically conversion of forests to agriculture, has occurred. The purpose of the study is to identify the predictors of land cover change in Lop Buri province for land that has been converted to upland crops or has undergone deforestation between 1989 and 2006. Four logistic regression models were constructed using spatially explicit biophysical and geo-social data, to account for changes to upland crops and forest loss from198998 and 19982006. Across the four models, slope, distance to forest edge, distance to towns, distance to roads, population size, and population density in various stand-alone and interactive forms were found to be the most consistent predictors of land cover change.
Development Studies	Sharecropping between poor landlords and rich tenants has hitherto been the subject of very little academic scrutiny. Given that such 'reverse share tenancy' contracts are mostly at odds with the canonical risk-sharing explanation for sharecropping, this article discusses a rationale for them that relies on weak property rights as well as the legal doctrine of adverse possession, and tests it using data from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar, where this type of tenancy accounts for one-third of land rentals. The empirical findings are discussed in relation to recent land-reform policies by the Government of Madagascar, the World Bank, IFAD, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
Social Work	Limited attention is given to how the poverty alleviation benefits children's development and breaking the transmission of intergenerational poverty in China. Based on two pilot programmes, Chunyu and Qianshou, in Shan'xi province, this study presents the potential effects of an asset-based family intervention that incorporates Child Development Accounts (CDAs) and parental support services on children and families. This study finds that the implementation of the programmes has positive financial and nonfinancial benefits for children and their families. The CDAs may serve as a key mechanism to integrate and strengthen the effect of asset building and parental involvement.
Economics	We analyze simple reinforcement-based behavioral rules in 3 x 3 games through choice data and response times. We argue that there is a large overlap between reinforcement-based heuristics (win-stay, lose-shift) and the more rational behavioral rule of myopic best reply. However, evidence from response times shows that choices in agreement with the common prescription of those rules are comparatively fast, and choices of the form lose-shift occur more frequently for larger differences with bygone payoffs. Both observations speak in favor of reinforcement processes as a cognitive shortcut for apparent myopic best reply, and advise caution when interpreting behavioral results in favor of optimizing behavior.

Nursing	As the number of individuals with autism grows, it is critical for nurses in all settings to understand how autism influences the family unit, as they will likely interact with these children, the adults, and their families. The intent of this descriptive narrative study was to explore the experiences of families of individuals with autism as perceived by the mother. Through personal interviews, 16 mothers' perceptions of the impact of autism on the family unit during different stages of the life cycle were revealed through a constructivist lens. Pediatric nurses employed in acute care settings, community, and schools are poised to assess and support these families following diagnosis and throughout the child's life. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Transportation	This paper deals with sensitivity analysis of static traffic user equilibrium problems. We apply some recently developed sensitivity analysis techniques for generalized equations to analyze the behavior of the equilibrium arc flow of such a problem when both the arc cost function and the travel demand vary. Our methods permit calculation of semiderivatives under general conditions and of derivatives under more restrictive conditions; we calculate the semiderivatives by solving a linear traffic user equilibrium problem and the derivatives by matrix multiplication together with the solution of a linear equation the dimension of which is at most the number of arcs. Three numerical examples show how to use these results in practice.
Linguistics	"The present article reports a comparative study of interactional metadiscourse markers in English and Persian research articles. Drawing on Hyland's (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse, this study investigates the employment of ""hedges"", ""boosters"", and ""attitude markers"" in a corpus composed of the post-method sections of 100 research articles (50 English and 50 Persian) in the field of architecture. Overall, it was found that there are statistically significant differences between the frequencies of hedges, boosters, and attitude markers used in English and Persian sub-corpora. Yet, the linguistic and functional analyses unveiled some basic similarities between the two languages in their epistemic metadiscourse strategies. The findings provide deep insights into the rhetorical conventions and norms in architectural articles and offer a broader perspective towards discoursing patterns and persuasion strategies of English and Iranian academic writers in this field."
Education & Educational Research	New evidence is provided about the degree of social segregation in England's secondary schools, employing a cross-national perspective. Analysis is based on data for 27 industrialised countries from the 2000 and 2003 rounds of the Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA). We allow for sampling variation in the estimates. England is shown to be a middle-ranking country, as is the USA. High segregation countries include Austria, Belgium, Germany and Hungary. Low segregation countries include the four Nordic countries and Scotland. In explaining England's position, we argue that its segregation is mostly accounted for by unevenness in social background in the state school sector. Cross-country differences in segregation are associated with the prevalence of selective choice of pupils by schools.
Health Policy & Services	This article focuses on the diffusion and adoption of innovations in clinical practice. The authors are specifically interested in underresearched questions concerning the latter stages of the creation, diffusion, and adoption of new knowledge, namely: What makes this information credible and therefore utilized? Why do actors decide to use new knowledge? And what is the significance of the social context of which actors are a part? This article first appeared in Health Care Management Review, 27(3), 35-47.
Business, Finance	"This study is the first to link managerial turnover to mutual fund managerial structure in a manner that indicates the strong presence of a conflict of interests between investors and fund sponsors in an area of fund governance where we have been led to believe there are strong and well-functioning mechanisms to guard against the exploitation of investors. I utilize the unique characteristics of mutual funds where managers sometimes manage multiple ""firms"" simultaneously, something not generally observed in industrial firms. I test the governance mechanisms using the mutual fund complexes management structure; unitary and multiple fund management (UFM and MFM). This study shows that UFMs tend to have higher asset growth rates and higher fees than MFMs, suggesting that sponsors can benefit more from keeping them intact. I find that changing managers under the UFM is more costly to sponsors making them more reluctant to fire poor performers. I document that underperforming UFM are -2.77% less likely to be replaced than their underperforming MFM counter-parts. In addition, the conflict of interests affect the replacement decision, as high expense ratio fund managers have a lower probability of replacement for a given level of underperformance.

Gerontology	Dementia is a global health issue and the effects on caregivers are substantial. The study aimed to examine the associations of burden, coping, self-efficacy with quality of life among family caregivers of persons with dementia in Singapore. Structured interviews were conducted in a convenience sample of 84 family caregivers caring and seeking clinical care for the persons with dementia in an outpatient clinic of a public hospital in Singapore. The outcome measures included the Family Burden Interview Schedule, Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scale, General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale - Brief Version. In general, significant correlations were observed between the quality of life scores with coping strategy and family burden scores, but not between the coping strategy and family burden scores. Compared to demographic factors such as caregiver age and household income, psychosocial factors including family burden, coping strategies, and self-efficacy demonstrated greater association with quality of life in the participants. However, the dynamics of these associations will change with an increasing population of persons with dementia, decreasing nuclear family size, and predicted changes in family living arrangements for the persons with dementia in future. As such, it necessitates continuous study examining the needs and concerns of family caregivers and the relevance of ongoing interventions specific to caregivers of persons with dementia.
History & Philosophy Of Science	"According to so-called ""thin"" views about the content of experience, we can only visually experience low-level features such as colour, shape, texture or motion. According to so-called ""rich"" views, we can also visually experience some high-level properties, such as being a pine tree or being threatening. One of the standard objections against rich views is that high-level properties can only be represented at the level of judgment. In this paper, I first challenge this objection by relying on some recent studies in social vision. Secondly, I tackle a different but related issue, namely, the idea that, if the content of experience is rich, then perception is cognitively penetrable. Against this thesis, I argue that the very same criteria that help us vindicate the truly sensory nature of our rich experiences speak against their being cognitively penetrable."
Cultural Studies	"This paper presents a systematic analysis of concepts of information found in the visual art of the Vancouver-based conceptual company N.E. Thing Co. Ltd. The company's evolving representations of ""Sensitivity Information"" are resolved into three distinct overlapping phases that correspond with co-president lain Baxter's deepening engagement with Marshall McLuhan's critical information theory during the turbulent years of 1964 to 1971.. The artist's creative dialogue with information science is situated against the backdrop of an emerging information society in Canada, McLuhan's discourse on the informationalization of the body and subjectivity, and an intensifying pedagogical crisis at Simon Fraser University's Centre for Communication and the Arts,where Baxter taught alongside composer R. Murray Schafer,in the period leading up to, and immediately following, the firing of the university's first president. A comparison of the information art of N.E. Ming Co. Ltd. with Schafer's informatic writings reveals that the company's articulation of Sensitivity Information constitutes what we would now recognize as a proto-deconstructionist destabilization of signal/noise binaries derived from Baxter's fusion of McLuhan with Alan Watts's popularization of Zen philosophy."
Linguistics	"This paper examines the phenomenon of lability in Estonian. We -describe the types of lability found in our database and the distribution of verbs according to formal (derivational) and semantic verb classes, and we propose an explanation for the spread of lability in the Estonian verbal lexicon. Estonian displays a wealth of labile verbs, compared with Finnish, for instance, a closely related language which uses similar (derivational and morphosyntactic) valency changing devices. We argue that Estonian lability has been co-conditioned by the following factors: a) intensive contact with German, a language rich in labile verbs, b) fluctuations in the productivity and regularity of the valency-decreasing derivation in the recent history of Estonian, c) the phonetic merger of different derivational suffixes leading to misinterpretation of the valency patterns of their derivatives, and d) form-driven analogy. In relation to the last factor we introduce the notion of ""clustered lability,"" which designates the expansion of the labile pattern over verbs sharing the same root."
Education, Special	"Reading is a crucial skill for students to develop, not only as they enter school but also as they continue throughout K-12 education. Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is one means of providing supplemental support for students to build the foundational key areas of reading-so they can use reading to learn in later schooling years. One such CAI program that exists in the marketplace is Headsprout, which includes both an Early Reading and Reading Comprehension component. To date, no peer-reviewed studies have conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of Headsprout on the five key areas of reading in the school setting. The most recent governmental review was completed almost a decade ago. As such, the purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing literature base to determine the level of evidence for each component""s effectiveness on each of the key areas of reading and identify existing avenues of future research. Results indicated tentative support for both components in some of the key areas of reading based on effect sizes, though there were a limited number of studies and the methodological rigor of included studies did not always meet What Works Clearinghouse standards. Implications for educators and researchers are discussed."
Criminology & Penology	It is 21 years since the publication of the author's Flashpoints: Studies in Public Disorder. In this book, and in subsequent publications, David Waddington and his colleagues have outlined and refined the so-called Flashpoints Model of Public Disorder, which has underpinned separate analyses of orderly and disorderly crowd events in Britain, Europe, Asia, Australasia, and North and South America. The model has had its critics and detractors-the most recent being Paul Bagguley and Yasmin Hussain, who level several criticisms at the model in their book, Riotous Citizens: Ethnic Conflict in Multicultural Britain, an analysis of the 2001 Bradford riot. This paper not only addresses these criticisms, but uses Bagguley and Hussain's own account as the basis of a re-analysis of the Bradford riot in terms of the flashpoints model.
History	This article compares the China Women's Oral History Project, directed by librarians at the China Women's University in Beijing, and Sisterhood and After: The Women's Liberation Oral History Project, directed by scholars at the University of Sussex in the UK. While the projects share aspects of method, our practices wrestle with distinct historiographical structures which are entwined with a history of state feminism in China and with dissenting, nongovernmental networks in the UK, as well as differing institutional contexts. As we have sought to develop a relationship as feminist oral historians, we have had to decenter our own frameworks to understand the local conditions under which we each work. The article concludes by analyzing what we share: the wish to find progressive spaces within universities and national funding structures, particularly as oral history work connects with community activists.
Development Studies	The relationship between income inequality and economic growth is estimated using dynamic panel estimation on a sample covering 112 emerging countries for the period 1980-2014. The results show that income inequality has a positive influence on economic growth for richer countries, in line with the classic theory, and a negative effect for poorer countries, as argued by the political economy approach.

History	In this paper we argue that historians of the eastern Arab lands (Ar.al-mashriq al-'arabi) should turn their attention to the Bedouins for two main reasons. First, the societies in the Arab East cannot be adequately understood without a full evaluation of their Bedouin component, especially outside urban areas. Second, studying the Bedouins can open new perspectives on important debates in Middle Eastern historiography. The paper further contends that the arid lands of the Arab East still need to be explored as a historical region with its own distinct patterns of regional connectivity and political organisation. Finally, we highlight environmental history and the study of emic categories as promising avenues for future research on this region.
Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism	This article examines the influence of a growing global tourism industry on the World Heritage City of Luang Prabang, Laos and more specifically the role played by the built environment in the transformations that have followed in the wake of its designation as a World Heritage City in 1995. Paradoxically, as increasing numbers of tourists seek to experience the extraordinary milieu of Luang Prabang, the physical and cultural landscapes that undergird this milieu are increasingly transformed by the pressures of global tourism. Using observations of tourists and residents, photographic documentation and comparison to United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) archival materials, we show that regulations intended to preserve the heritage of Luang Prabang, have valorized a particular aspect of the city's history while effectively erasing others. As a result, the built environment of the city has been transformed into a tourist landscape. Simultaneously, the intangible heritage, the everyday life and experience of local populations are undermined as the built environment is transformed into tourist-focused landscapes. This case study illustrates, and continued UNESCO concerns over development in Luang Prabang indicate, it is not enough to create a policy designed to protect the physical environment without simultaneously working to protect the embedded socio-cultural dimensions of heritage tourism destinations.
Business, Finance	We outline a parsimonious empirical model to assess the relative usefulness of accounting- and equity market-based information to explain corporate credit spreads. The primary determinant of corporate credit spreads is the physical default probability. We compare existing accounting-based and market-based models to forecast default. We then assess whether the credit market completely incorporates this default information into credit spreads. We find that credit spreads reflect information about forecasted default rates with a significant lag. This unique evidence suggests a role for value investing in credit markets.
Information Science & Library Science	Purpose - Scholars and practitioners alike view knowledge as a crucial organisational asset. Over the past decade, several knowledge management (KM) technologies have emerged, such as wikis. A wiki is a web-based hypertext application that supports a collaborative and conversational approach to KM. While wikis are generally simple to use, their adoption for managing organisational knowledge sometimes meets resistance from employees. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors affecting the user acceptance of organisational wikis as a means of knowledge creation and diffusion. Design/methodology/approach - Building on the existing research on KM and information technology adoption, this study identified the following factors: the relevance of top management support for and complexity of enterprise wikis as well as technical support and knowledge-sharing self-efficacy. A cross-sectional survey was employed to examine the influence of these factors on employees' acceptance of corporate wikis. Overall, 102 employees participated in the online survey, and the data collected were analysed using the partial least squares method. Findings - The research model developed demonstrates that top management support, technical support and knowledge-sharing self-efficacy have a positive significant effect on employees' willingness to use wikis for knowledge-creation purposes within organisations. Originality/value - The findings of this study contribute to the existing literature on the implementation of wikis as a KM technology by developing a theoretical model explaining employees' acceptance of this technology. Organisations could use this model to guide and facilitate wiki initiatives.
History	When the Germans launched their Spring Offensives of 1918, they placed tremendous pressure on the alliance between Britain and France. While French and British soldiers had formed strong relations through mutual cooperation at the Somme in 1916, the French experiences at Verdun and during the mutinies of 1917 had changed the way they viewed the war and, most crucially, how they would view any allied failures. When the British were forced to retreat following the beginning of Operation Michael in March 1918, the French reacted with fury. This article examines the nature of the French evaluations of the British during 1918 and the extent to which they judged their ally to have failed them. By using the collections of the Commissions de controle postal for the French army during the war, it will show the depths to which French opinion of the British fell in the first half of the year but also how British actions towards the war's conclusion managed to restore some of their honour in French eyes.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Since the 1970s, the various manifestations of mental health problems among Western employees have multiplied. This paper explores how occupational health physicians' perceive the changes that have enabled the emergence of mental health concerns in the Finnish welfare regime. The interpretations of health professionals with long working careers (41 in-depth interviews of Finnish occupational health experts) are placed in a conflictual social arena, in which the tendencies of medicalization and informalization frame professionals' work in the changing context of working life, culture and medical practice. The results emphasize three historical transformations: (1) the loosening of the stigma related to mental health problems (informalization of mental health problems), (2) the changing character of employees/patients (psychologically aware customers) and (3) the paradox of a new medical culture (decreasing medical dominance and increasing medicalization). This article demonstrates the ambiguity health professionals faced when patients with psycho-emotional health issues entered their occupational territory. It shows how the experiences of mental health professionals reflect the informalization of social contacts and conflicting tendencies related to medicalization. These are manifested in the social relationship between doctor and patient, the labelling of mental health problems and the medical culture related to mental health.
Social Issues	Governments face the challenge of fostering the social economy in a context of economic crisis and austerity policies. Despite the high levels of institutional recognition for the considerable social and economic value added by the social economy (SE), government policies following this approach have been scarce during the latest economic recession. This article analyses the case of Spain, a country that has endured deep austerity policies and has a strong SE sector. Building on the SE approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data, this study examines the policies that promoted the SE during two periods: before and during the economic crisis. As a novel contribution, the study compares the political discourse with the policies implemented. The findings highlight a gap between the discourse and the policies implemented during the crisis, showing that the SE has not been prioritized by policymakers, and link that gap with the recent EU economic policy.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	The regression anatomy theorem (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion [Princeton University Press]) is an alternative formulation of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem (Frisch and Waugh, 1933, Econometrica 1: 387-401; Lovell, 1963, Journal of the American Statistical Association 58: 993-1010), a key finding in the algebra of ordinary least-squares multiple regression models. In this article, I present a command, reganat, to implement graphically the method of regression anatomy. This addition complements the built-in Stata command avplot in the validation of linear models, producing bidimensional scatterplots and regression lines obtained by controlling for the other covariates, along with several fine-tuning options. Moreover, I provide 1) a fully worked-out proof of the regression anatomy theorem and 2) an explanation of how the regression anatomy and the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorems relate to partial and semipartial correlations, whose coefficients are informative when evaluating relevant variables in a linear regression model.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	In this paper, we establish several relations between convex order, variance order, and comonotonicity. In the first part, we extend Cheung (2008b) to show that when the marginal distributions are fixed, a sum with maximal variance is in fact a comonotonic sum. Thus the convex upper bound is achieved if and only if the marginal variables are comonotonic. Next, we study the situation where besides the marginal distributions; the variance of the sum is also fixed. Intuitively one expects that adding this information may lead to a bound that is sharper than the comonotonic upper bound. However, we show that such upper bound does not even exist. Nevertheless, we can still identify a special dependence structure known as upper comonotonicity, in which case the sum behaves like a convex largest sum in the upper tail. Finally, we investigate when the convex order is equivalent to the weaker variance order. Throughout this paper, interpretations and significance of the results in terms of portfolio risks will be emphasized.
Law	"This Essay pays tribute to Daniel Meltzer's insight that, to the extent ""lawyers have a common intellectual heritage, the federal courts are its primary source."" I do so by analyzing how that heritage is made and remade, as political forces press Congress to deploy federal courts to protect a wide array of interests and state courts absorb the bulk of litigation. The heritage that Meltzer celebrated and to which he contributed was the outcome of twentieth-century social movements that focused on the federal courts as hospitable venues, serving as vivid sources of rights and remedies. A competing heritage has since emerged, as the Supreme Court shaped new doctrines constricting judicial powers and rendering courts unavailable and unavailing. Despite the Court's reluctance to welcome claimants, Congress continues to endow the federal courts with new authority and significant funds. But what the federal government has thus far ignored are the needs of state courts, where 100 million cases are filed annually and states struggle to honor constitutional commitments to open courts and rights to counsel for criminal defendants. Once state courts come into focus, two other and competing understanding of courts come to the fore. One merits the term ""enabling courts,"" as judges aim to equip litigants with lawyers and resources for conflicts related to families, housing, and health. From ""Civil Gideon "" movements and self-help forms to drug and reentry courts, new initiatives underscore the goals of using courts to be responsive to social needs. But another vector of court activities falls under the nomenclature of ""exploitive courts,"" using discriminatory fines, fees, and threats of jail for those unable to pay to turn courts into profit centers to augment localities' budgets. Inequality and racial tensions are the leitmotifs of this decade;"" it is neither surprising nor inappropriate that these issues are played out in public courts as well as in electoral politics. But these very inequalities counsel the need to develop a new intellectual heritage, premised on the interdependencies of state and federal courts, sharing the common purpose of fullling constitutional obligations in this democratic polity to enable access to their public services. Insofar as modern lawyers have a common intellectual heritage, the federal courts are its primary source."
Urban Studies	Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) has existed for over three centuries and has developed into the financial capital and most important economic hub of Vietnam. This profile outlines the history of HCMC's development and its impact on current conditions and physical structure of the city. The paper analyzes some of the problems with respect to urban land use that have occurred in HCMC in the transitional period after Doi Moi and discusses the city's future challenges, in the perspective of climate change and further economic and population growth.

History	This article examines Soviet policy towards Greece, Iran and Turkey during the early Cold War. It argues that Stalin's aims in relation to these countries were limited and secondary to more important goals in Europe. Equally, the postwar crises in Greece, Turkey, and Iran played a critical role in shaping differing Soviet and Western perceptions of the causes of the Cold War. An important part of the story on the Soviet side was the role of wounded national pride in propelling Stalin into the Cold War.
Transportation	Attended home delivery services face the challenge of providing narrow delivery time slots to ensure customer satisfaction, while keeping the significant delivery costs under control. To that end, a firm can try to influence customers when they are booking their delivery time slot so as to steer them toward choosing slots that are expected to result in cost-effective schedules. We estimate a multinomial logit customer choice model from historic booking data and demonstrate that this can be calibrated well on a genuine e-grocer data set. We propose dynamic pricing policies based on this choice model to determine which and how much incentive (discount or charge) to offer for each time slot at the time a customer intends to make a booking. A crucial role in these dynamic pricing problems is played by the delivery cost, which is also estimated dynamically. We show in a simulation study based on real data that anticipating the likely future delivery cost of an additional order in a given location can lead to significantly increased profit as compared with current industry practice.
Nursing	"Computers were introduced into nursing care areas in the early 1950s; however, nursing informatics"" historical roots emerged much earlier. Contrary to previous studies, which used manual review of the nursing informatics literature, we employed an automated, electronic approach with specialized software to identify its historical roots. The corpus of nursing informatics literature was harvested from Scopus using informatic* in information source titles, abstracts, and keywords, limited to the subject area = nursing. The search resulted in 3805 publications containing 57 057 valid references. Fifteen historical sources were identified, the two oldest written by nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale. Other historical roots represent specific foundational and core scholarly works offering insight into the genesis and sustainment of particular bodies of literature in the field of informatics. Our study revealed that the field of nursing informatics has sought to respond to global health concerns and that through intensive development nursing informatics has become an independent research area affecting nursing advancements in general. Additionally, nursing informatics has influenced other disciplines. This study offered an in-depth look at nursing informatics literature, using a systematic approach to identify historical roots and analyze the evolution of topics and themes to gain more information about knowledge development in nursing informatics."
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Much of the practice of nursing continues to be based on tacit rather than explicit knowledge, with children's nursing practice worldwide nuanced by local cultures of caring. The development of Afrocentric nursing practice models and tools challenges researchers to find methods which enable promising local practices to be identified and described. Visual research methods are an emerging approach within nursing and health research. However, detailed accounts of the implementation of these methods in clinical nursing settings are scarce. Visual methods (graphic facilitation, sociograms, and photographic elicitation) formed a core part of the data collection strategy for a qualitative observational study of nursing practices in relation to the involvement of families in the care of their hospitalized children in Southern Africa. We draw on this experience to provide a detailed account of the implementation of these methods and reflect on their effectiveness. Practical suggestions for using visual methods applicable to a variety of clinical nursing settings are offered based on implementation experience. We advocate that the use of these methods within the context of health research requires better anticipation of specific ethical considerations. We conclude that visual methods can contribute usefully to the development of new models of nursing practice, with strengths that include helping to anchor dialogue, supporting the articulation of conceptually rich practice narratives and explanations, and acting as a useful adjunct to communication between nurses and researchers.
International Relations	This study relates the concept of recognition to processes of conflict transformation. The recognition concept has been underdeveloped in recent International Relations literature, where the main emphasis has been on interstate relations and on recognition as cause of conflict. This article challenges that understanding through the introduction of the concept of thick recognition. Thus an understanding of recognition which is applicable also in intrastate conflicts is developed. Through a strong emphasis on intrastate relations and identity politics, I develop thoughts on how narratives of war can be reversed through the introduction of narratives of recognition. The study thus provides theoretical concepts and distinctions that can be used as a framework for the study of thick recognition and its relationship to broader processes of conflict transformation. The theoretical framework is employed in a case study on the Israeli debates about New History'. Insights from the case contribute to understandings of inhibiting and facilitating circumstances for the introduction of narratives of thick recognition in conflicted societies. The study ends with a discussion on the usefulness of the theoretical concepts for further work on recognition within the field of International Relations.
Cultural Studies	This article explores the way in which the portrayal of gender becomes linked to that of ethno-nationalism on the popular Serbian reality show The Palace. On the basis of a textual analysis of the public reactions to the reality show and its interpretations by the local audiences in Slovenia and Serbia, we claim that the show promotes specifically gendered and sexualized ethno-national identities, and that the interpretation of the show continues to be aligned with discourses of ethno-nationalist belonging. We argue that commercial, ethno-national femininity is currently employed to re-legitimate patriarchal nationalism in the name of freedom and empowerment via self-promotion.
Environmental Studies	Integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) are advocated as a promising strategy to increase agricultural production and rehabilitate degraded pastures while mitigating GHG emissions. Although iCL in Brazil has increased over the past few years, it still occupies a small share of the country's total agricultural area. We investigate the determinants of iCL occurrence in Mato Grosso state, a globally important producer of beef cattle and grains that has experienced rapid land cover change and environmental degradation in recent decades. Our analysis encompasses two typical cases of iCL in Mato Grosso (the rotation of soy followed by pasture, and soy followed by maize and pasture) as well as biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors observable at the household and/or municipality levels that may influence the wide scale occurrence of iCL. Evidence at both scales suggests that knowledge and supply chain infrastructure play an important role in early occurrence of iCL, as they are more common in regions closer to iCL research stations and processing facilities of grains and cattle. On average iCL adopters are more educated and have better access to technical assistance and sector information than specialized farmers or ranchers. Most iCLs are concentrated near established soy areas and greater similarity exists between municipalities with iCL and soy-dominant municipalities vs. pasture-dominant municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of specific conditions for iCL occurrence and iCL promotion in livestock-dominant regions. Incentives targeted at ranchers are crucial for the achievement of the Brazilian Government's goal to restore degraded pastures through agricultural intensification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropology	Recent archaeological field surveys and excavations at Qiaojiayuan, a platform 40 km west of the Yun County in present-day northwestern Hubei Province (central China), revealed four tombs (M-3, M-4, M-5 and M-6) dating back to around 6th to 5th century BC. The grave's layout, artifact assemblages and burial practice indicate that the owners of these four graves were aristocrats of the Chu state. Five turquoise-inlaid bronze artifacts (two swords and three dagger-axes) were excavated. The sword from M-4, imbedded with pieces of well-cut and finely-polished turquoise on its handle, was in a very bad state of preservation and underwent conservation treatment. Some sticky, whitish pastes were exposed when the inlaid turquoises dropped off. The pastes were supposed to be residues of unknown binding agents. Samples of the pastes were collected for FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) and XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) analyses to determine the chemical component(s). The results revealed that the pastes were composed of almost pure beeswax. This indicated that beeswax was used as binding agent in turquoise-inlaid bronzes as early as the 6th to 5th century BC in China. Review of recent technical studies suggested that beeswax was used in early China in several different regions (mostly southern part of China) for at least two different purposes (binding agent and lightening).

Demography	BACKGROUND Very few studies have analyzed the fertility change in Niger - a country where the total fertility rate has remained high and stable over the last decades. OBJECTIVE This study looks at the fertility change in Niger from a parity perspective to consider if reproductive behaviors are revealing some ongoing changes under the apparent stability of the total fertility rate. METHODS Using birth history data from four representative sample surveys, parity progression ratios and mean birth intervals were computed, covering three decades of fertility change in Niger. RESULTS Confirming the stability of the level of fertility, the results show little change in the progression to the successive parities. Yet, although women in Niger still end their reproductive lives with a similar number of children, the birth intervals indicate that the onset of childbearing and the progressions to the successive birth orders have been progressively delayed. CONCLUSIONS Over the last three decades, Nigerien women have continued to manage to bear a rather stable average number of children in their lifetimes, compressing their fertility to an ever-reducing number of reproductive years. CONTRIBUTION This study documents the parity-specific fertility changes that are indeed at work in a pretransition situation for which few evidences are available, still.
Gerontology	The provision and arrangement of care for elderly people is one of the main challenges for the future of European welfare states. In both political and public discourses elderly people feature as the subjects who are associated with particular needs, wishes and desires and for whom care needs to be guaranteed and organised. Underlying the cultural construction of the care regime and culture is an ideal type model of the elderly person. This paper analyses the discursive construction of elderly people in the discourses on care in Austria. An understanding of how elderly people as subjects, their wishes and needs and their position within society are constructed enables us to analyse, question and challenge the current dominant care arrangements and its cultural embeddings. The paper demonstrates the processes of silencing, categorisation and passivation of elderly people and it is argued that the socio-discursive processes lead to a particular image of the elderly person which consequently serves as the basis on which the care regime is built.

Women'S Studies	This article examines the condition of women workers in the mica industry of Giridih District, Jharkhand, India. The study shows that the decline of the mica industry led to informalisaton of work, that trade unions have not been able to improve working conditions at all or press for better wages for women workers relative to men. I argue that strong patriarchal values among union leaders have been a major factor in their neglect of women workers in this industry.
Transportation	This paper analyses the interplay of transport and development in North Korea, one of the most state-con trolled and underdeveloped countries of the world. While broader aspects have been well described by various studies, logistics have been given little attention as permissive or restrictive factors in the country's development. Despite the recent reforms and growth of trade, the development of North Korea is confronted to the weaknesses of the transport system and inland logistics. An analysis of vessel movements at North Korean ports (1985-2006) shows that although coastal economies may increasingly use maritime transport to overcome inland blockages, the evolution of port traffics better reflects broader trends such as a general economic decline, the westward shift of populations, and the polarization of economic activities around the Pyongyang area. Beside those trends, the research also estimates the importance of maritime transport to North Korean trade and it provides a base upon which further studies can be conducted, so as to evaluate better the place of North Korea among transport studies.
Health Policy & Services	Background: A range of evidence informs healthcare decision-making, from formal research findings to 'soft intelligence' or local data, as well as practical experience or tacit knowledge. However, cultural and organisational factors often prevent the translation of such evidence into practice. Using a multi-level framework, this project will analyse how interactions between the evidence available and processes at the micro (individual/group) and meso (organisational/system) levels influence decisions to introduce or diffuse innovations in acute and primary care within the National Health Service in the UK. Methods/design: This study will use a mixed methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and involves four interdependent work streams: (1) rapid evidence synthesis of relevant literature with stakeholder feedback; (2) in-depth case studies of 'real-world' decision-making in acute and primary care; (3) a national survey and discrete choice experiment; and (4) development of guidance for decision-makers and evaluators to support the use of evidence in decision-making. Discussion: This study will enhance the understanding of decision-makers' use of diverse forms of evidence. The findings will provide insights into how and why some evidence does inform decisions to introduce healthcare innovations, and why barriers persist in other cases. It will also quantify decision-makers' preferences, including the 'tipping point' of evidence needed to shift stakeholders' views. Practical guidance will be shared with healthcare decision-makers and evaluators on uses of evidence to enable the introduction and diffusion of innovation.
Nursing	Nurses must demonstrate leadership and followership competencies within complex adaptive team environments to ensure patient and staff safety, effective use of resources, and an adaptive health care system. These competencies are demonstrated through the use of communication strategies that are embedded within a relational practice. Health care professionals, regardless of formal position, need to assert their opinions and perspectives using a communication style that demonstrates value of all team members in open discussions about quality patient care, appropriate access, and stewardship. Challenges to effective communication and relational practice are the individual and organizational patterns of behavior, and the subsequent impact that these behaviors have on others. Students articulate situational awareness when they conduct a critical analysis of individual, team, and organizational functioning, and then use this information and evidence gained from a critical literature review to develop recommendations to improve individual, team, and/or organizational performance. Leadership and followership simulation exercises, inclusive of public feedback and debriefing, are used as a pedagogical/andragogical strategy in a nursing baccalaureate senior leadership course to facilitate learning of team communication skills and improve situational awareness. We view this strategy as an alternative to traditional classroom learning activities which provide little opportunity for recursive learning. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
History	This article explores the case of the French cultural institute in London which found itself at the nexus of Gaullist as well as anti-Gaullist networks during the Second World War. By analysing the support that the institute's director, Denis Saurat, brought to Charles de Gaulle in the early days of Free France, the article contributes to our understanding of the formation of Free French political thought. This study analyses Saurat's shifting position in the movement, from being Gaullist to becoming an active partisan of anti-Gaullism. The examination of Saurat's networks and politics helps to re-appraise further trends of anti-Gaullism caused by leftist views not least regarding the lack of democratic principles that characterized Free France in 1940-2. Finally, Saurat's anti-Gaullism was also prompted by his refusal to put the French cultural institute in London at the service of de Gaulle and support Free French propagandist, cultural and academic ambitions in the world. Overall this article argues for a reassessment of London-based leftist anti-Gaullism understood not just through issues of personalities and democracy but also through the prism of cultural diplomacy and propaganda.
Ethics	This paper asks whether we can defend associative duties to our compatriots that are grounded solely in the relationship of liberal co-citizenship. The sort of duties that are especially salient to this relationship are duties of justice, duties to protect and improve the institutions that constitute that relationship, and a duty to favour the interests of compatriots over those of foreigners. Critics have argued that the liberal conception of citizenship is too insubstantial to sustain these duties - indeed, that it gives us little reason to treat compatriots any differently from how we treat foreigners, with all the practical consequences that this would entail. I suggest that on a specific conception of liberal citizenship we can, in fact, defend associative duties, but that these extend only to the duty to protect and improve the institutions that constitute that relationship. Duties of justice and favouritism, I maintain, cannot be particularised to one's compatriots.
Social Issues	This article discusses the idea of an Atomic Priesthood, a religious caste that would preserve and transmit the knowledge of nuclear waste management for future generations. In 1981, the US Department of Energy commissioned a Human Interference Task Force (HITF) that would examine the possibilities of how to maintain the security of nuclear waste storage sites for 10,000 years, a period during which our civilization would likely perish, but the dangerous nature of nuclear waste would persist. One option that was discussed was the establishment of an atomic priesthood, an idea that science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov and Arsen Darney had already toyed with. Reading the HITF report alongside sci-fi novels, my article will shed light on the question of how the sheer force of nuclear power (and the longevity of nuclear waste) lends itself to religious interpretations and how the idea of the atomic priesthood is connected with the utopian/dystopian aspects of nuclear power.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	To avoid disclosures in public use microdata, one approach is to release partially synthetic data sets. These comprise the units originally surveyed with some collected values, for example sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of key identifiers, replaced with multiple imputations. In practice, partially synthetic data typically are generated from Bayesian posterior predictive distributions; that is, one draws repeated values of parameters in the synthesis models before generating data from them. We show, however, that inferentially valid, partially synthetic data can be generated by fixing the parameters of the synthesis models at their modes. We do so with both a theoretical example and illustrative simulation studies. We also discuss implications of these results for agencies generating synthetic data.
Anthropology	Malacological sequences from two archaeological sites on the floodplain of the Seine, Northern France, provide new data on the palaeoenvironmental development of this region during much of the Holocene. Both sites, situated similar to 100 km apart, have broadly similar sedimentary archives with comparable malacological successions. These Holocene malacological assemblages shed light on the development of the vegetation cover. From the late Neolithic, they reflect open environments, possibly resulting from increasing use of the floodplain for agropastoral activities. These developments are reminiscent of those observed from molluscan assemblages in other regions of northwest and central Europe. The landscape is cleared of trees between 4500 and 1200 cal BC. At the end of the Subboreal, it is dominated by agricultural land. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Low-wage work is a central concept in considerable research, yet it lacks an agreed-upon definition. Using data from the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement, the analysis presented in this article suggests that defining low-wage work on the basis of alternative hourly wage cutoffs changes the size of the low-wage population, but does not noticeably alter time trends in the rate of change. The analysis also indicates that different definitions capture groups of workers with substantively different demographic, social, and economic characteristics. Although the individuals in any of the categories examined might reasonably be considered low-wage workers, a single definition obscures these distinctions.
Ethnic Studies	The life expectancy differential between Indigenous and other Australians is in the order of 11 years and requires far-reaching, complex and multifaceted policy responses. Theories and instruments of international human rights are among those that have helped to shape responsive policy discourses. Developing these often abstract rights into people's substantive capacities to make meaningful choices about how they will live is difficult, but the article shows how this is possible with reference to a general theory of capabilities as self-determination. Such a theory, proceeds from Sen and Nussbaum's extension of Aristotle's concern for human flourishing' where the political right to self-determination, affirmed at international law, presumes certain essentialist capabilities to secure, people's political agency. These essentialist capabilities suggest a distribution of authority on the basis of equal opportunities to make choices of personal value, rather than just an egalitarian concern for equality of outcomes.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Patient education is one of the four main hospital tasks in Norway. The intention is to reduce the impact of chronic diseases, and the rationality is obvious: knowledge of one's own disease should lead to a positive health outcome. But patient knowledge can challenge the health worker, for when it comes to taking care of own disease, interaction with health workers is important. This paper investigates the role and value of knowledge in the interaction. The investigation is done through analysis of stories in an inductive process informed by the connection between knowledge and power and systemization of the lifeworld. Five different relationships are identified: the classic relationship, the team relationship, the battle relationship, the inverted relationship and the powerless relationship. All five relationships are considered as double meetings: one meeting in the system between a patient and a health worker, and one meeting in the lifeworld between two human beings. The professional meeting is found to be subordinate to the human one. Social Theory & Health (2009) 7, 81-99. doi:10.1057/sth.2008.22
Public Administration	The Bologna Process (BP) presents the largest ongoing reform initiative in higher education (HE). Although it has triggered large-scale changes in HE structures in Europe, comparative analysis about its impact on other regions of the world is scarce. Using transnational communication and sociological institutionalism as a theoretical framework, this article investigates the impact of the BP on the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and the Caribbean [LAC] and (parts of) Africa. Our results demonstrate that not only the policies promoted in the realm of the BP, especially in the field of study structures, have been copied by non-European HE institutions, but also its governance modes for managing transnational HE reform initiatives. Thus, the BP can be regarded as a template for transnational HE harmonization processes in the absence of legal obligation.
Area Studies	In general, peace agreements with power-sharing provisions are analysed at a national level. This article offers insights into the practices of power-sharing in the local arena of western Cote d'Ivoire, in the town of Man. It investigates what brought about a change towards peace in the region of Man and then presents local forms of power-sharing between the community leaders and the rebels who have established a rather complex system of domination and taxation in the territory they occupy. Moreover, the implementation of a territorial power-sharing device, which is part of the peace agreement negotiated among the warring parties at the national level, is analysed: the redeployment of state administration to the rebel-held zones of the country. The ethnographic data on which the article is based reveals that the actors at the local level have their own strategies to address urgent needs and that they play a more active role in peacemaking than is usually acknowledged.
History & Philosophy Of Science	A number of formal constraints on acceptable abstraction principles have been proposed, including conservativeness and irenicity. Hume's Principle, of course, satisfies these constraints. Here, variants of Hume's Principle that allow us to count concepts instead of objects are examined. It is argued that, prima facie, these principles ought to be no more problematic than HP itself. But, as is shown here, these principles only enjoy the formal properties that have been suggested as indicative of acceptability if certain constraints on the size of the continuum hold. As a result, whether or not these higher-order versions of Hume's Principle are acceptable seems to be independent of standard (ZFC) set theory. This places the abstractionist in an uncomfortable dilemma: Either there is some inherent difference between counting objects and counting concepts, or new criteria for acceptability will need to be found. It is argued that neither horn looks promising.
Urban Studies	"The existence of slums or informal settlements is common to most cities of developing countries. In India, slums contain a wealth of diversity that is masked by a high level of poverty and rather insufficient access to resources. Recent studies have identified that the conventional perception of slums as distinctive homogeneous settlements is incorrect, rather slums are diverse and complex systems that cannot be addressed through one-size fits all approaches. In this paper we investigate Tilly""s theory on group segregation and how it reproduces or reinforces inequality within the slums of Bengaluru. We apply statistical techniques (correspondence analysis and regression) to novel field data from 37 slums in Bengaluru. First, we find high levels of spatial and group segregation by religion across the slums of Bengaluru. Second, we find that segregation leads to opportunity bias among slum dwellers, which inhibits equitable access to jobs in the labour market. Finally, the results show that insufficient access to resources constrain the income generation and leads to emerging coping strategies. The results indicate that group identity is key to addressing disparity and how solving inequality can drastically impact group identity. Our results show that targeting horizontal inequality (as compared to vertical inequality) may increase the rate of successful interventions for each of the segregated groups of slum dwellers."
Political Science	"The contributions gathered in this special issue of Politix underline the interest of the notion of ""differential management of illegal practices"" formulated by Michel Foucault thirty years ago. The use of this notion in social sciences should be seen here as a contribution to government studies: in a context of tightening state control over certain populations, it focuses on the unequal enforcement of legal provisions by state agents in charge of qualifying and repressing illegality, without limiting the scope to the mere analysis of judicial actors. Studying the differential enforcement of the law first supposes to analyze the dispositions and the professional ethos of civil servants. But it also implies to see the management of illegality as a collective and relational phenomenon: state officials act out in local arenas where other actors are able to use the law and negotiate its implementation. In the same way, this study requires to think the management of illegality and illegal practices themselves as mutually constitutive, and to analyze them jointly."
Public Administration	The commissioning of public services from the third sector is explored. The article is based on a qualitative review of pilots for a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) project-'LinkAge Plus'-for people aged over 50. The article offers organizations and policy-makers new insights into the issues faced by the third sector and commissioners of services. The main issue identified is the fragility of the accounting information used to make decisions and monitor progress.
Economics	For a representative sample of manufacturing firms in 26 countries, the article shows that changes in the cost of importing over time is significantly and negatively correlated with changes in the percentage of firm's material inputs that are of foreign origin. Furthermore, we show that there may be a non-linear relationship between import costs and imports. These findings are important as recent studies point towards a significant positive effect of imported inputs on productivity and growth. We hope that the present article inspires more work on the determinants of imported input usage especially in developing countries.
History Of Social Sciences	British sociology was established as an academic discipline between 1945 and 1965, just as the British Empire was gearing up for a new phase of developmental colonialism backed by the social and other sciences. Many parts of the emerging sociological discipline became entangled with colonialism. Key themes and methods in sociology and the staff of sociology departments emerged from this colonial context. Historians have tended to place postwar British sociology in the context of expanding higher education and the welfare state, and have overlooked this colonial constellation. The article reconstructs this forgotten moment of disciplinary founding and explores three of the factors that promoted colonial sociology: the Colonial Social Science Research Council, the so-called Asquith universities, and the social research institutes in the colonies; and the involvement of sociologists from the London School of Economics in training colonial officials.

Communication	"Advancing theory in media exposure and effects requires contending with an increasing level of complexity and contingency. Building on established theoretical concerns and the research possibilities enabled by large social datasets, we propose a framework for mapping information exposure of digitally situated individuals. We argue that from the perspective of an individual's personal communication network, comparable processes of ""curation"" are undertaken by a variety of actors-not only conventional newsmakers but also individual media users, social contacts, advertisers, and computer algorithms. Detecting the competition, intersection, and overlap of these flows is crucial to understanding media exposure and effects today. Our approach reframes research questions in debates such as polarization, selective and incidental exposure, participation, and conceptual orientations for computational approaches."
Information Science & Library Science	This exploratory study aims to improve librarian support for undergraduate users as they find, access, evaluate, and appropriately use primary source materials in their research. By approaching object-based information literacy instruction via the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework), this project will promote use of academic library special collections and archives in ways that reinforce the theoretical approach espoused by that document. Primary source evaluations collected before and after one semester of Framework-based instruction indicate that the concepts identified therein are relevant to and support learning with primary sources.
Area Studies	In light of Turkey's changing policy prior to the Erim government, which followed the second Turkish military coup d'etat, Israeli Consul General, Efraim Elrom, was kidnapped and then murdered. This essay examines Turkey-Israel relations during and after the murder and observes any changes in the countries' stance toward each other whilst dealing with the Elrom Affair. The essay is based on unexamined primary sources from the Israeli National Archives and State Department.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	"Deconstructing a political myth that recognizes Verdi as ""the father of the Italian homeland"", this text proposes a re-reading of the usual representation of relationships between Italian opera and the Risorgimento. Far from denying the function of opera in constructing a nationalist discourse, the text emphasizes and analyzes the specific (and sometimes contradictory) mechanisms of this function. This article investigates how opera houses served as key locations for the dissemination of a patriotic discourse, and examines the complex, two-way exchange between musical melodrama and the Italian nationalist movement between 1846 and 1849: patriotic themes penetrated the intrigues of librettos and inflamed audiences well beyond composers' intentions, while melodramatic narration influenced language, gestures and political narratives of the period. This text demonstrates how, in Risorgimento Italy, national discourse was marked by the ""melodramatic imagination"" masterfully discussed by Peter Brooks."
Business, Finance	This study investigates the influence of managerial incentives to meet or beat the zero earnings benchmark on labor cost behavior of private Belgian firms. We posit that relative to managers of firms reporting healthy profits, managers meeting or beating the zero earnings benchmark will increase labor costs to a smaller extent when activity increases and decrease labor costs to a larger extent when activity decreases. This should take the form of more symmetric labor cost behavior for firms that report a small profit. Our findings are consistent with this prediction. Using detailed employee data, we show that managers of firms reporting a small profit focus on firing employees who are relatively low cost to fire. To protect their reputation in the labor market, managers of other firms, particularly those reporting healthy profits, limit the numbers of dismissals and react to activity changes by changing the number of hours that employees work.
Ethnic Studies	Attitudes towards social groups that have traditionally been marginalised or discriminated against have changed markedly in Britain over the past three decades. This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people's attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.
Area Studies	Siam managed to replace royal absolutism with limited monarchy in June 1932 without any chaos or bloodshed. But the transition quickly proved to be far from complete. The country was to undergo a major upheaval before suffering a semi-civil war only about a year after the princely rule was toppled. The new regime, accordingly, began to consider its constitution as a symbol behind which the people could be mobilized. A massive campaign for the document was then launched in late 1933 and it soon culminated in what can be regarded as the practice of constitution worship. This article will look at the campaign in detail, especially with respect to its underlying logics; the aim is to reveal and analyse the attempt by the revolutionary regime to transform the first permanent constitution into a sacred entity. Meanwhile, in pursuing such an aim, this article will shed light on the formation of a constitutional culture in Siam. Given that a basic law had never existed in the country, the article will discuss not only how the state promoted the permanent constitution, but also how the Siamese society encountered and experienced constitutional rule for the first time.
Linguistics	On the basis of an examination of remnant VP-topicalisation constructions, this paper argues for an order preservation analysis of Scandinavian Object Shift. Extending the empirical database, we account for the phenomena in an Optimality Theoretic framework. The paper focusses on two particular constructions in Danish and Swedish, namely particle verb constructions and causative constructions with Danish lade and Swedish lata 'let'. It is shown how differences in the VP-internal object position give rise to mirror image sequences concerning Object Shift in connection with verb second (V degrees-to-I degrees-to-C degrees movement) and with remnant VP-topicalisation.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper is about a relatively unknown north-west European organization of spatial planning: the (standing) Conference for Spatial Planning in NorthWestern Europe. The founders of CRONWE tried to create a European spatial planning approach that could influence spatial development in the early years of European integration as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and later the European Economic Community (EEC) were created. Spatial development, as a topic to be addressed, never reached the negotiation tables though, and CRONWE was created as a permanent platform for discussion with the obvious hope that gradually 'Europe' would recognize the relevance and even necessity of European spatial planning. In this paper we use a number of basic concepts of the historical institutionalist approach towards planning research; in particular institutionalization, critical junctures, and path dependency. We apply these concepts to analyse and evaluate the four decades that CRONWE existed. We are particularly interested in assessing why the CRONWE planning agenda remained marginal in the European integration process.
Cultural Studies	This essay explores the proposition that the other/otherness/alterity is within us, and how we remain strangers to ourselves, as the title of the book by Julia Kristeva (1991) claims. The concept of multiple identity' is examined on the basis of Arthur Rimbaud's Je est un autre, its consequences and readings by Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva; and through various representations of the multiplicity that each subjectivity consists of. As Rimbaud illustrates, identity is inherent to alterity: the I' cannot be conceived of without the other, who is the condition of his existence. Otherness is something internal and originary, and constitutive for human identity. The second part of the essay reflects on the experience of living in diaspora, and specifically the experience of language, of the mother tongue, after a migration. The essay locates and discusses certain conditions of diasporic subjectivity inherently related to questions about subject formation and language. How does language (or the use of a mother-tongue) shape and form our understanding and sense of being in the world? How can speaking in another language present a form of estrangement from the self?
History & Philosophy Of Science	Prior work on weakness of will has assumed that it is a thoroughly psychological phenomenon. At least, it has assumed that ordinary attributions of weakness of will are purely psychological attributions, keyed to the violation of practical commitments by the weak-willed agent. Debate has recently focused on which sort of practical commitment, intention or normative judgment, is more central to the ordinary concept of weakness of will. We report five experiments that significantly advance our understanding of weakness of will attributions by showing that the ordinary concept of weakness of will is less thoroughly psychological than the philosophical debate has assumed. We begin by showing that a sizable minority of people attribute weakness of will even in the absence of a violated commitment (Experiment 1). We then show that weakness of will attributions are sensitive to two important non-psychological factors. First, for actions stereotypically associated with weakness of will, the absence of certain commitments often triggers weakness of will attributions (Experiments 2-4). Second, the quality of an action's outcome affects the extent to which an agent is viewed as weak-willed: actions with bad consequences are more likely to be viewed as weak-willed (Experiment 5). Our most important finding is that the ordinary concept of weakness of will is sensitive to two non-psychological factors and is thus much broader than philosophers have thus far imagined. We conclude by suggesting a two-tier model that unites our findings with traditional philosophical theorizing about weakness of will.
Rehabilitation	Purpose: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), has a significant impact upon daily functioning. Most recommended treatments aim to alter activity patterns based upon assumptions of activity avoidance. However, as there is limited research on the experience of activity and occupational beliefs in people with CFS/ME, this study took a qualitative approach to understand the meaning of activity in people with this disabling condition. Method: This study applied a social constructivist grounded theory methodology. Semi-structured interviews took place with 14 participants attending a Specialist CFS/ME Service in England. Findings: The emergent themes described a premorbid state of constant action with difficulty stopping an activity once it had commenced. When this pattern was interrupted by illness, participants attempted to maintain their previous level of occupational engagement. Negative associations and emotions were described in response to the concept of doing nothing or limited activity. A recurring cycle was reported of increasing activity levels when symptoms improved, followed by post exertional symptoms. Conclusions: Consequently, participants' beliefs about concepts of both activity and inactivity need to be considered within the application of rehabilitation programmes for CFS/ME that aim to modify activity related behaviours.
Development Studies	Microinsurance - defined as low-cost insurance products targeting low-income populations - exemplifies key themes in contemporary neoliberalism, and has figured prominently in neoliberalism's turn to discourses such as 'risk management' and 'financial inclusion'. The development of commercial markets for microinsurance, however, has in practice been highly variable and often very limited. This article considers the implications of this process of 'truncated commercialization'. It draws on a Polanyian analytical framework that emphasizes the contradictory regulatory dynamics involved in the commodification of labour. The article applies this approach by tracing multiscalar efforts to promote microinsurance, examining the emergence of the concept in the efforts of the International Labour Organization to promote social security for informal workers in the 1980s and 1990s, looking at the adoption of explicitly commercializing imperatives in the work of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors in the 2000s, and, finally, considering a case study of South Africa. The truncated commercialization of microinsurance, it is argued, provides a useful lens through which to see the practical impossibility of neoliberal development strategies.
Urban Studies	Only limited research has addressed time patterns regarding visits to urban green spaces (UGSs), whereby less has concentrated on relevant variations across population groups. However, this concerns the effective management and provision of UGSs. This study investigated the time patterns of UGS visits, particularly focusing on the variations across wide-ranging visitor characteristics in Guangzhou, China. An in-person survey in 24 green sites using stratified sampling produced 595 valid questionnaires. Descriptive statistics depicted the general time patterns, while multivariate logistic regression examined the variations across the visitor characteristics. The results indicate that more visits occurred at night and on weekends, whereas hot noon was avoided. The temporal imbalances need to develop strategies to rationally distribute UGS traffic at different times, thus having important implications for UGS management. The visit timing significantly varied with seven visitor characteristics and these variations should be factored into the UGS decision-making process. The findings help promote effective management and targeted planning of UGSs, having significant implications for cities in China and beyond. Several findings concerning visitor characteristics may contribute new insights, but more research is needed. Future studies should consider the effects of UGS attributes and pay more attention to the visit timing of the elderly.
Environmental Studies	It is now widely accepted that research about people and their interactions with wildlife provides unique and significant contributions that enhance our understanding of interspecies relationships in tropical forests. Studying human-nonhuman relationships involves not only the gaining of in-depth knowledge about local beliefs, values, and practices, but also the examination of the cosmopolitan identities of individuals as well as the impact of social and cultural processes of globalisation. Hence, it is imperative to explore the complexity of local communities living in protected areas. In this study, I consider the impact of community-based conservation (CBC) within Amazonianist societies and discuss how Western human-centred ideals of conservation can be made complementary to existing indigenous belief systems, sometimes resulting in unique and insightful outcomes. I present a case study showing how two Tikuna communities in the Colombian Amazon adopt transcultural beliefs and display innovation and resilience in the face of environmental and cultural change, and how these processes generate attitudes towards conservation initiatives and influence local livelihoods that are transformed by conservation efforts. I suggest that acknowledging indigenous populations as changing groups with dynamic, practical understandings of humans and nonhumans is a vital step towards identifying solutions to socioecological problems, where the needs of people and wildlife are met simultaneously.
Management	This paper examines the concept of expatriates, arguing that sloppy use of the term in the past has led to problems of inconsistent research, incompatible findings and a lack of clarity in the field. The increasing interest over the last dozen years or so in other forms of international experience, often equally poorly conceptualized, has compounded the problem. We argue for the need for greater construct clarity in studies of expatriates and, by extension, of other forms of international experience. Specifically, we attempt to clarify to whom does the term expatriate', and specifically business expatriate', apply and the boundary conditions under which expatriate employment is enacted.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The research project discussed in this paper looks at cross-cultural, remote collaboration in design learning. It identifies eleven evolving design patterns. The paper presents a summary of these patterns. In a long-term, ethnographically informed study, I used a mixed method approach to investigate cross-cultural collaboration practices. I analyse data from the first and second year of this study inductively to identify recurring themes and patterns in design collaboration. A deductive analysis in the third year facilitated the articulation of the identified design patterns. Triangulation of data and comparison of Hong Kong/Korean, Hong Kong/Taiwanese and Hong Kong/Austrian collaboration allowed for evaluation of the patterns' validity across cultures. The paper suggests a community-lead evaluation of the proposed patterns for further research. The findings attempt to raise awareness about the needs and possibilities for localizing learning designs and technologies by designers and developers of interactive learning environments.
Sociology	"This article examines North American national news media's 2015-16 presentation of family meals. Analyzing 326 articles, I identify the ubiquity of a narrative of deterioration, or the presumption that families are replacing meals made from whole, unprocessed ingredients consumed communally around a table, with processed and pre-prepared foods eaten alone or ""on the go"". In analyzing the construction of responsibility for this deterioration, I find that the sample predominately frames the production of healthy family meals as constrained by a food environment saturated with inexpensive, highly processed food, and dictated by the competing demands of paid work and inflated normative standards. Yet, when differentiating frames that define the social problem from those that offer solutions, I find that individualization prevails in the frames that target solutions. One important exception is media reporting on low-income families, which are framed as facing exceptional structural constraint. Analyzing these frames, I argue that neoliberal ideology that over-emphasizes individual agency and minimizes structural constraint operates in more subtle ways than previous literature suggests-showing some awareness of the difficulty of people's lives, but prescribing solutions that leave individuals responsible for the outcomes. These findings offer implications for understanding dominant cultural values surrounding health and the family meal, as well as the allocation of responsibility for social problems within neoliberalism more broadly."
Business, Finance	Extant research on voluntary disclosure about future prospects has focused on two forward-looking disclosure mechanisms: management forecasts and conference calls. This study examines the accelerated filing of material contracts as another type of future-related disclosure that involves no forecasting. I find that firms are more likely to accelerate material contract filings when forward-looking disclosures could lack credibility or arouse litigation concerns. However, for proprietary cost considerations, firms delay contract filings when facing high (low) product market competition from incumbents (potential entrants). I also find that accelerated contract filing is incrementally associated with lower information asymmetry. Overall, while presenting a cost-benefit trade-off that is distinctly different from forward-looking disclosures, accelerated contract filing is an important alternative channel through which firms communicate future prospects to investors.
Management	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe how a phenomenological approach can help to understand embodied dimensions and compare different and shared qualities, functions and potential, as well as ambivalences and limitations of metaphors and stories in organisations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a phenomenological understanding and use of multiple discourses, the specific expressive and communicative nature, linkages to meaning, mediation and integration, as well as transformational, innovating and generating potentials of metaphors respectively, narratives are analysed conceptually and discussed. Accordingly similarities and differences, overlapping and conflicting patterns, thus correspondences and rapprochements of both metaphors and narratives are shown and illustrated. Findings - The critical comparison of various, especially transformative functions, ambivalences and ambiguous uses of metaphorical and narrative sides and practices reveals their inherently dynamic inter-relational nexus. The analysis shows how metaphors and stories/narratives can serve each other, as well as how they work together and contribute for transformation in organizations. In turn, this also offers new potential for understanding the practical opportunities and obstacles to the management of change. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in that besides using multiple discourse, it follows an advanced Merleau-Pontyian phenomenological approach and thus considers embodied dimensions of metaphors and stories/narratives and its implication for organizations critically. Working out the intriguing relationship between metaphor and narrative offers significant new insight and avenues for the research of organizational inertia and change.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	The notion of medical enhancement technologies has drawn attention to optimization techniques within the health area. However, this notion has evolved at the level of governmental programmes, with very little attention directed towards people's own practices. Using a social scientific body of knowledge about enhancement technologies and a Foucauldian analytical framework, this article explores how users engage with alternative medicine. Drawing on in-depth interviews with Danish users and observations of their treatment sessions, the article demonstrates how they embark on a voyage of discovery with the body to enhance their own selves and bodily resources. The discussion centres on Rose's approach to medical enhancement technologies and Foucault's notion of 'technologies of the self'. A wider field of tension is outlined in which embodied alternative treatment practices play a role in various modalities of transforming and controlling bodies and selves. It is argued that such practices can be conceived of as enhancement technologies at the users' level by showing how they not only concentrate on treatment and body maintenance, but also foster the enabling processes of changing habits, preferences, and attitudes, and creating a subjective sense of their bodies.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	This study discusses the effects of oversimplifying the between-subject covariance structure on inferences for fixed effects in modeling nested data. Linear and quadratic growth curve models (GCMs) with both full and simplified between-subject covariance structures were fit to real longitudinal data. The results were contradictory to the statement that using oversimplified between-subject covariance structures (e.g., uni-level analysis) leads to underestimated standard errors of fixed effect estimates and thus inflated Type I error rates. We analytically derived simple mathematical forms to systematically examine the oversimplification effects for the linear GCMs. The derivation results were aligned with the real data analysis results and further revealed the conditions under which the standard errors of the fixed-effect intercept and slope estimates could be underestimated or overestimated for over-simplified linear GCMs. Therefore, our results showed that the underestimation statement is a myth and can be misleading. Implications are discussed and recommendations are provided.
Education & Educational Research	Research on the school discipline gap reveals growing awareness of the disproportionate impact on students of color; however, dynamics of the racial discipline gap remain underanalyzed. This article uses risk ratios to descriptively establish if ethnic disproportionality in school discipline is present among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subgroups. We find that when AAPI data are disaggregated, significant variations in discipline patterns emerge. Pacific Islanders are nearly twice as likely as their White peers to be disciplined when separated from Asian Americans, and all Pacific Islander subgroups are at equal or higher risk for discipline. We also find a discipline gap between ethnic subgroups. Our findings affirm the need to further refine the analyses of race and school discipline.
Social Work	School, family, and community partnerships are among the suite of strategies advocated for improved school outcomes in which social workers can play a valuable role. Such partnerships are complex to implement in practice and there is little systematic research to guide the practitioner. This study evaluated an early intervention partnership program involving school, family, community, and philanthropic partners implemented in two primary schools in rural Victoria, Australia. The findings highlighted challenges in the process of evaluation and program implementation and in the opportunities this provided to identify key enabling factors. These involved having: a shared vision and aims; democratic governance; a supportive policy and organisational environment including external funding; workers with skills and clear roles; activities for project momentum; and ongoing review and evaluation. These factors can be used by social workers and others working with schools as a valuable conceptual framework to facilitate school, family, and community partnership processes.
Business	The article explores passion as a connecting force between entrepreneurship and consumption. Although a rising interest within the academic debate, the issue of how passion can be interpreted as a bridge between consumption and entrepreneurship still needs to be investigated. Hence, the main purposes of this paper is to propose the concept of connecting passion by identifying a) the factors that combine consumption as self-expression (being consumer) and entrepreneurship (being entrepreneur) through passion and b) the resulting entrepreneurial profiles. Both emerge from an empirical investigation based on the case analysis of emblematic companies. The concept of connecting passion is characterized by the following fundamental features: passion as game, passion as self-continuity, the search for uniqueness through self experimentation, and cohabitation with the consumer community. The paper discusses the concept relating it to the existing literature. Finally, it advances the main managerial implications of the research.
Demography	The United States adult entertainment industry demand undocumented migrant women because they work more hours, receive lower wages and are preferred by customers as they are more docile than native women. In this industry as important as the recruitment of new women is the expulsion of those that are not profitable. This study, based on a qualitative methodology that includes in-depth interviews with seventy-five Central American women victims of sexual exploitation in the United States, concludes that procurers use immigration law to get rid of pregnant, older, non-profitable and conflicting women, and customers use the law to force foreign women to fulfil their whims. In conclusion, immigration law promotes human trafficking because it empowers procurers and customers, and makes victims more vulnerable.
Social Work	Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an orientation to practice that values evidence as a resource for clinical decision making while recognizing that evidence alone is never sufficient to make a clinical decision. Critics of EBP typically ignore, negate, or misrepresent the role of practitioner thinking processes and expertise in clinical settings. The authors believe that, far from being a mechanistic process that ignores practitioner expertise, reflection and critical thinking are essential to implementing EBP in real-world clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance for how practitioners bring their expertise to bear when engaging in the process of EBP. The authors use a social work practice scenario to illustrate the application of practitioner expertise in each of the five steps of EBP.
Industrial Relations & Labor	It is often asserted that the labor market is characterized by rigidities that make it difficult for older workers to carry out their desired trajectory from work to retirement. One potentially important source of rigidity is the restrictions on hours of work imposed by firms, but such rigidities are difficult to measure directly. The authors explore two variables that may serve as proxies for flexibility in hours at the employer level: the shares of older workers and young women in the employer's work force. The authors use matched worker-firm data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics study for the period 1990-2004 to analyze the effects of these variables on the job separation propensity of workers aged 45-69. Results indicate that older workers employed in firms with greater shares of older workers and young female workers have a lower propensity for job separation. These findings provide indirect but suggestive evidence of the importance of labor market rigidities in shaping employment decisions of older workers.
History Of Social Sciences	This paper examines the role of Bishop Fulton Sheen in the popularization of Freudian psychoanalysis in the United States during the 1940s and 50s. Social historians argue that Freudian ideas were pervasive in American culture during this period. While their claim speaks mainly to the impact of psychoanalysis on the cultural elite and college educated, they also suggest that Freudian ideas affected ordinary men and women. In the former case, the group impacted is small and not representative of the population as a whole; in the latter, the evidence is sparse and impressionistic. Neglected in their consideration is the influence of Fulton Sheen whose opinions on Freud reached an audience of 30,000,000 during the height of the popularity of his TV show, Life is Worth Living. Sheen's audience was more inclusive and representative of mainstream America. The negative and highly cautionary view of psychoanalysis he presented to many Americans was contrary to that which was promoted to and embraced by many of the college educated and likely shaped both their views of Freud and psychoanalytic therapy.
Public Administration	Drawing on interviews with former political leaders and senior public servants, this article maps the values that have guided asylum policy decisions over the past three decades. The findings support the view, that a culture of control permeate policy decisions, but pushing deeper that policy-maker perceptions of asylum issues are shaped by two primary values: nation building and good governance. Values that tend to preoccpy policy critics, for example human rights, compassion, international legal obligations and national character: are by no means absent, but are subsumed within and harnessed to the desire to be a good engineer and responsible governor: The study, adds to the insights required for constructive dialogue between goverments and refugee adovcates,a nd affords a comprehensive framework within which asylum policy can be understood and analysed.
Industrial Relations & Labor	"In 2001, 2007 and 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions recognized, step by step, the right to bargain collectively as a part of the constitutionally enshrined freedom of association in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These Supreme Court decisions have the potential to create a wave of optimism among workers with low job security because they have created a great opportunity for these workers to improve their collective representation. The purpose of this article is to analyze the collective representation of precarious workers in view of these new developments. Our analysis shows that legislators have not made any significant effort to ensure that workers have more access to collective representation and collective organizations, once a pillar for the development of collective action in the middle of the 20(th) century, have not done so either. The synergy between these two sources of worker support no longer achieves this objective. In fact, during the last few years, it has been the courts, particularly the Supreme Court of Canada, which have created the components for a better collective representation of workers. The article begins with an emphasis on how legislation and collective action are obstacles to improving collective representation for workers with low job security, whereas the courts recognize that workers are on the vulnerable side of the employment relationship and that some workers are more vulnerable than others. As a result, the courts tend to decide in favour of better protections for workers. Moreover, in 2007 and 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada decided that the freedom of association protections in section 2(d) of the Charter included the right to collective bargaining. But the Court declared that protection for collective bargaining rights is not sufficient. These rights need an effective statutory framework. The Court added that it was not constitutionalizing ""a particular model of labour relations, nor ... a specific bargaining method."" This precision has shaped litigation in Quebec, where it has been an ideal breeding ground for creating new forms of collective representation for those workers who have less capability to bargain collectively and require statutory support for an effective protection for the right to organize and bargain collectively. The article continues by giving an account of two litigations that implement the lessons of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of migrant agricultural workers and home care workers."
Family Studies	Recent demographic trends constitute movement away from forms of relationship behaviour central to hegemonic heterosexuality. The perceived legitimacy of cohabitation, relationship dissolution and same-sex partnerships has also increased. Has a further shift occurred, among people not living with partners, away from conventional coupledom as an ideal? Using data from the second National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL II), this article examines trends and patterns in the incidence of sexually exclusive co-residence as an ideal future lifestyle. While subscription to this 'traditional' ideal varies substantially with age and other salient factors, it nevertheless remains prevalent virtually throughout the 'single' population. Furthermore, there was no marked change across the 1990s in this ideal's popular appeal, highlighting its continuing influence as a 'meaning-constitutive tradition' (Gross, 2005). Relationship practices and ideals thus appear to have diverged, with the former changing more. However, as lifecourses unfold, people sometimes relinquish the traditional ideal, not infrequently favouring 'living apart together' instead.
Education, Special	African American children continue to be overrepresented in special education classrooms. Despite this overrepresentation, there is a noticeable void in the literature concerning the family perceptions of special education and the impact these perceptions may have on parents' level of involvement. Therefore, this article discusses (a) African American family involvement in the educational process, including special education; (b) the perceptions of African American families concerning special education and how these perceptions might prevent parents from participating; (q) potential barriers to participation; and (d) suggestions for increasing the level of participation of African American families in the educational process.
Demography	BACKGROUND Since the mid-1990s, South Korea has undergone two remarkable social changes: a large-scale expansion in higher education and a transition to lowest-low fertility. These changes offer an appropriate quasi-experimental setting for the causal inferences of the impacts of college education on transitions into marriage and parenthood. OBJECTIVE I examine the effects of the large-scale college expansion on first marriage and first childbirth, using data from South Korea. METHODS I define two cohorts of women depending on their exposure to the expansion (preexpansion versus post-expansion), and from this I identify a marginal group affected by the college expansion. Using a difference-in-difference approach, I examine how marriage and childbirth changes in this group (the New College Class) differed in comparison with the changes in other groups (the High School Class and the Traditional College Class). RESULTS I found a considerable impact of college expansion on the falling rates of first marriage and first childbirth among the New College Class women. The growing divide in family formation between college graduates and non-college graduates explains a large part of the total college expansion effects, while the effect of increased education among New College Class women was minimal. CONCLUSIONS The college expansion in South Korea did have an impact, but the impact was mostly indirect from interactions with other social structural changes. CONTRIBUTION I provide causal evidence on the impact of the large-scale expansion in higher education on family formation, in particular fertility, utilizing a novel analytical approach and a rare empirical case in South Korea.
Social Issues	This study examines the relationships of volunteering behaviors with work-retirement patterns and transition among middle-aged and older Americans using the Health and Retirement Study data (1998-2008). Latent class analysis was used to identify retirement status and cluster respondents into five latent classes: the not-retired, partial retiree, full retiree, non-worker (e.g., homemakers), and the transitioned (i.e., the newly retired from paid work). Generalized linear mixed models showed those experiencing work-retirement transitions were significantly more involved in volunteering than the not-retired. Partial retirees and full retirees were more likely to start volunteering, and full retirees were also more likely to end volunteering than the not-retired over the 10-year observation period. Volunteer organizations are advised to recruit older adults who have time available and social connections with the workforce and to target the newly retired who are likely to increase their volunteer time during the transition process.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Drawing on interviews, this article investigates change and continuity induced by greater diversity among pension trustees in terms of trustees' involvement in boardroom activities in the UK. Utilizing Bourdieu's theory of habitus, the authors demonstrate the agency of trustees, and how greater diversity among trustees changes the boardroom decision-making process. However, the authors also reveal forms of continuity by reproduction of educational, corporate and social values within a boardroom context. The findings challenge the assumption that greater diversity may radically transform organizations.
Social Work	Despite traditionally having low numbers of doctoral students, social work research is currently undergoing expansion at doctoral level. Professional doctorates are starting up, which are highly applied to practice and include modules as well as a thesis, and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) has now recognized social work as a separate discipline for doctoral training. The aims of this research project were to identify who these social work doctoral students are, what they are researching and what their experience is of doctoral study. Quantitative and qualitative data were generated via a web-based survey of social work doctoral students across the UK-those on professional doctorates as well as Ph.D.s and those engaged in full-time and part-time study. The data were subject to bivariate analysis. There was also a search conducted of the Index to Theses for doctoral theses on social work topics over a ten-year period. Findings from both elements of the research are presented in relation to student demographics, employment and funding, type of doctorate, methodology and student satisfaction.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	This article proposes the notion of 'evidence-based activism' to capture patients' and health activists' groups' focus on knowledge production and knowledge mobilisation in the governance of health issues. It introduces empirical data and analysis on groups active in four countries (France, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom), and in four condition-areas (rare diseases, Alzheimer's disease, ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and childbirth). It shows how these groups engage with, and articulate a variety of credentialed knowledge and 'experiential knowledge' with a view to explore concerned people's situations, to make themselves part and parcel of the networks of expertise on their conditions in their national contexts, and to elaborate evidence on the issues they deem important to address both at an individual and at a collective level. This article argues that in contrast to health movements which contest institutions from the outside, patients' and activists' groups which embrace 'evidence-based activism' work 'from within' to imagine new epistemic and political appraisal of their causes and conditions. 'Evidence-based activism' entails a collective inquiry associating patients/activists and specialists/professionals in the conjoint fabrics of scientific statements and political claims. From a conceptual standpoint, 'evidence-based activism' sheds light on the ongoing co-production of matters of fact and matters of concern in contemporary technological democracies.
Political Science	The aim of this article is to examine the link between the quality of social protection and citizens' satisfaction with the functioning of democracy - an association that has received very limited attention in the rich body of empirical research on popular satisfaction with democracy. To test the hypothesis that social protection levels influence citizens' satisfaction with democracy, the article conducts a multi-level regression analysis using European Social Survey (2008/9) data from 24 countries. The results of the analysis demonstrate that between-country differences are linked to variation in social protection levels, and within-country differences depend on individual satisfaction with social provision, while controlling for other relevant factors. The findings indicate that people do expect democratic regimes to provide social protection along with economic performance and thus suggest that democratic governments face a challenge in meeting simultaneous demands for social protection and economic prosperity. Altogether, the study contributes to debates about the implications of welfare policies and citizen satisfaction with regime performance.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	How do professionals respond to the commodification of health care? Using an interactionist perspective, we answer this question by referring to the findings of five qualitative studies of hospital surgeons, mental health-care professionals, emergency and ambulance personnel, and youth workers in the Netherlands. We find that differential levels of professional autonomy, dominance and discretion spawn different combinations of the logics of the market, bureaucracy and professionalism. We discern five new ways of enacting professionalism: (1) entrepreneurialism: embracing commodification as integral part of professionalism; (2) activism: rallying against encroachment on the profession; (3) bureaucratization: seeking reassurance in procedures; (4) pretending: faking compliance to protect autonomy; and (5) performing: upholding the profession through conscious and skillful management of appearance in the eyes of patients and the public. Hidden strategies of opposition, however, support commodification since most professionals outwardly play by the rules and mix the Logic of care with those of the market and bureaucracy, rendering alternative courses of action and solidarity more difficult. Uncertainty is increasing for all professionals, leading to feelings of insecurity and reflexivity but also to creativity. Professionalism is increasingly 'disembedded', called into question, and de-routinized.
Rehabilitation	There is a rapidly growing body of research that demonstrates the positive effects of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention on the communication of children and adults with complex communication needs. Despite the positive impact of many AAC interventions, however, many individuals with complex communication needs continue to experience serious challenges participating in educational, vocational, healthcare, and community environments. In this paper, we apply the framework proposed by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to illustrate the need to re-think AAC intervention to improve outcomes for individuals with complex communication needs, and to foster a new generation of intervention research that will provide a solid foundation for improved services. Specifically, the paper emphasizes the need to take a more holistic view of communication intervention and highlights the following key principles to guide AAC intervention and research: (a) build on the individual's strengths and focus on the integration of skills to maximize communication, (b) focus on the individual's participation in real-world contexts, (c) address psychosocial factors as well as skills, and (d) attend to extrinsic environmental factors as well as intrinsic factors related to the individual who requires AAC.
Linguistics	From the beginning of world Englishes (WE) as a field of study, Yamuna Kachru was a strong advocate for users of English in all circles. She consistently argued for language teaching and for language acquisition research that would acknowledge the diverse bilingual and multilingual contexts in which English is learned and used. This paper considers just four of her areas of interest as they pertain to language pedagogy and world Englishes: the interlanguage hypothesis and fossilization, discourse studies, contrastive rhetoric, and the sociolinguistic realities of learners and teachers. The conclusion offers touchstones from her work to inspire future research.
Law	"Federal agencies have long relied on animal studies to determine, at least preliminarily, whether or not a particular substance is carcinogenic. The important question is: Should those studies be admissible in court? Seventeen years ago Daubert provided courts with a framework for answering that question., and the answer has, in most cases, been ""no."" Some courts, however, have carved out an exception for the place where agencies and courts collide. Where an. agency, (Specifically, the Environmental Protection Agency) has relied on animal studies in order to designate a substance as ""carcinogenic,"" courts have admitted those studies, even where they would not have if the study had been conducted by a. private party. This Note argues that this approach is a mistake. The EPA's animal testing guidelines give animal studies neither the reliability nor relevance demanded by Daubert, and, as such, their standards should not be used to admit otherwise inadmissible studies. Furthermore, this Note encourages courts to 90 back to Daubert's roots when determining whether agency animal studies should be admitted in the future."
Substance Abuse	Background: Preventing tobacco product initiation in youth is a critical need. While cigarette smoking among youth has been on the decline, tobacco use in other forms, such as e-cigarettes and vaping, continue to be a major concern. The purpose of this study was to conduct a real-world, quasi-experimental test of the effectiveness of a web-based videogame, smokeSCREEN, aimed at developing healthy beliefs and knowledge associated with tobacco product use prevention, including electronic cigarettes. Methods: Adolescents (N = 560) aged 10-16 years were enrolled from schools and afterschool programs in a single-group pre-post study. Measures included a pre- and post-survey of beliefs and knowledge about tobacco product use. At post-survey, participants were asked questions regarding their gameplay experience. Paired responses for the tobacco product use in the beliefs and knowledge survey before and after the smokeSCREEN videogame intervention were compared using McNemar's test. Descriptive statistics were generated to assess overall participant gameplay experience. Results: McNemar's test showed significant differences in the proportions of correct answers before (pre-survey) and after (post-survey) the intervention in seven out of eight belief questions (p < . 0001). It also suggested significant differences in the proportions of correct answers before (pre-survey) and after (post-survey) the intervention in all six knowledge questions (p < . 0001). Several gender and age differences were noted for belief and knowledge questions related to e-cigarettes and vaping. There was no association between gameplay duration at post-survey or to the answers of the beliefs or knowledge questions. Overall, participants reported that they enjoyed playing the game. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the videogame intervention, smokeSCREEN, has a promising effect on participants' beliefs and knowledge about tobacco product use, including electronic cigarettes and vaping, and is well accepted by adolescents.
Education, Special	Background: There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that behavioural activation for depression is an equally effective but less complex treatment than cognitive behavioural therapy. It may therefore be more suitable for those who are cognitively impaired (i.e. early-stage dementia or mild cognitive impairment) or have a learning disability. Materials and Methods: A case study is presented that outlines how a behavioural approach was used to support an older adult with a learning disability and mild cognitive impairment who was depressed. It was delivered by the carer liaison practitioner employed by a memory service. Results: The client's score on the GDS-LD reduced from 23 to 5 and on the GAS-ID from 19 to 11 indicating a clinically significant improvement in his symptoms of depression and anxiety at post-treatment. Mood ratings on the Ottawa Mood Scales rose from 2/10 to 7/10. Increased engagement in activities and an improvement in the client's problem-solving abilities were evident. Conclusions: The case study demonstrates the clinical utility of behavioural activation as a treatment for depression in an older adult with a learning disability and mild cognitive impairment. This matches the findings of other studies of behavioural activation as an intervention to treat depression in older adults. However, the client did not have a formal diagnosis of learning disability and may therefore be atypical. More comprehensive studies, including randomised controlled trials, are needed to confirm these findings and more thoroughly test the effectiveness of behavioural interventions with this client group.
Law	"Lawyers commonly associate with nonlawyers to assist in their performance of lawyering tasks. A lawyer cannot know with confidence, though, whether the delegation of some tasks to a nonlawyer colleague might result in her assisting in the unauthorized practice of law, because the state of the law and the commentary about nonlawyer practice is so confused and incoherent. Some respected authority within the profession tells the lawyer that she may only delegate preparatory matters and must prohibit the nonlawyer from discussing legal matters with clients, or negotiating on behalf of clients. Other authority suggests that the lawyer may delegate a wide array of tasks as long as the lawyer supervises the work of the nonlawyer and accepts responsibility for it. A good-faith lawyer reviewing the available commentary would find it difficult to achieve appropriate comfort with her delegation decisions. This uncertainty affects not only lawyers working with paralegals and law clerks, but firms hiring out of state lateral associates and partners, and law school clinical programs engaged in transactional work. This Article articulates a framework for assessing delegation choices, a framework which seeks to be both coherent and sensible. The framework relies on insights about lawyering judgment and risk assessment, client informed consent, and unauthorized-practice-of-law prophylaxis. Any delegation of work by a lawyer to a nonlawyer involves an exercise of the lawyer's judgment about an appropriate balance of risk and efficiency, along with an eye toward the client's informed choice about how to achieve the goals of the representation most efficiently. The prevailing unauthorized-practice-of-law dogma prevents a client from seeking the most economical representation by only retaining a nonlawyer, but that dogma trusts lawyers to protect a client's interests. With those considerations in place, this Article shows that the profession cannot, and in fact does not, deny the lawyer any categorical options in making delegation choices, except for those involving court appearances. Aside from sending a nonlawyer to court or to court-connected proceedings, a lawyer may responsibly delegate any of her lawyering activities to a nonlawyer associate, subject to the prevailing conceptions of competent representation and to the lawyer's retaining ultimate responsibility for the resulting work product and performance. Some commentary and some court opinions suggest a different answer to the questions addressed here, but those authorities do not withstand careful analysis. This Article shows that a more careful reading of the commentary and the court dicta supports the framework and the thesis offered here. Nonlawyers may not independently engage in activity that equates to the practice of law, if by ""independently"" we mean without supervision and oversight from a lawyer. That important and uncontroversial limitation, however, is the only categorical restriction on a lawyer's discretion. A supervised non lawyer may play a much more active and important role in a lawyer's overall representation of her client than many have claimed. For the client, that is a very good result."
Substance Abuse	Objective: In this study, 218 national drug rehabilitation center helpers in Malaysia were surveyed regarding perceptions of their on-the-job clinical supervision needs and preferred supervisor roles and emphasis areas in their supervision sessions. Methods: Descriptive analyses were conducted. Results: Findings suggest that drug rehabilitation center helpers in Malaysia expressed high level of on-the-job supervision needs. In addition, professional behavior skills were found to be the most desirable supervisory area followed by process, conceptualization, and personalization skills. Conclusions: Implications for providing clinical supervision for drug rehabilitation center helpers in Malaysia were discussed, along with suggestions for future research.
Ethnic Studies	Yuval-Davis discusses three interconnected questions relating to identity. She first examines whether and in what ways the notion of identity should be theorized, on the one hand, and empirically researched, on the other, focusing on the opposing views of Stuart Hall and Robin Williams. She then examines the contested question of what is identity, positioning it in relation to notions of belonging and the politics of belonging, and in relation to several influential schools of thought, especially those that construct identity as a mode of narrative, as a mode of performativity or as a dialogical practice. Her third interrelated question concerns the boundaries of identity and the relationship between self and non-self. She explores both social psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to that question, and deals with questions such as reflexivity, identifications and forced identities. The last part of the article explores several types of relationships between self and non-self, such as: 'me' and 'us'; 'me/us' and 'them'; 'me' and other 'others'; 'me' and the transversal 'us/them'. Yuval-Davis's basic argument here is that dichotomous notions of identity and difference, when theorizing boundaries of individual and collective identities, are more misleading than explanatory.
Environmental Studies	Following the increased extension of forest plantations in Brazil, new challenges for landowners, forest technicians and policy and decision makers have emerged in order to ensure the provision of the ecosystem goods and services. Nevertheless, fire represents one of the most important limited factors of forest plantation growth and production in Brazil, especially in the Cerrado biome. This work focuses on the evaluation of the priority of the variables that landowners take into account during forest plantation establishment. The combined use of SWOT analysis and Analytic Hierarchical Process facilitates the priority ranking, allowing the assessment of the variables regarding fire-related aspects. The study highlights that landowners recognize fire as a hindering factor for forest plantation production adopting some preventative actions, even though these are poorly organized and rather made by default. Improving the awareness of landowners, promoting the local market of forest productions, and reducing costs for plantation establishment represent the main challenges highlighted in this study. The combined methodology applied represents a helpful tool for decision makers, offering them the possibility to assess the current gaps in plantation establishment with a particular focus on fire-related aspects.

Education, Special	The purpose of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of 25 years of mathematics interventions for students with mathematics difficulty or disability in Grades 4 through 12. A search of the literature yielded 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were coded to extract important study information (e.g., participant information, research design, description of treatment, and comparison groups) and data needed to calculate Hedge's g. We used robust variance estimation (RVE) to address dependence resulting from multiple outcomes per study. The RVE random-effects model estimated a treatment effect of 0.85. After adjusting for small-study effects, the final model estimated an underlying, moderate effect of 0.49 with a large amount of unexplained heterogeneity between studies. Studies with more than 15 hr of treatment and those focused on fraction content significantly moderated mathematics outcomes. Findings are limited by extreme variability across study estimates, the lack of standardized mathematics measures, and a limited number of studies across 25 years of research.
Geography	Despite the persistence of Malthusian arguments that human population will grow to outstrip the Earth's capacity and resources, current demography actually foretells the impending end of growth in the next half century. We are approaching a global baby bust. What does this mean for global political labor economies, regional resource economics, and local struggles over gender and power? This paper concludes, through a survey of current research, that geographers already have the conceptual equipment to answer these enormously important questions. We further argue that the fundamental underpinnings of much contemporary economic and social theory, having been developed in times of rapid population growth and labor surplus, must be reconsidered as we enter a period of different material conditions. Reviewing recent developments in population geography and feminist geopolitics, global geographies of labor and aging, and emerging patterns of resource intensification and disintensification, we suggest that - if infused with an explicit political economy - attending to the baby bust can show the way forward to help revitalize our understanding of bodies and materiality in critical and human geography.
Public, Environmental & Occupational Health	Introduction: Autonomous motivation (motivation to engage in a behavior because of personal choice, interest, or value) is often associated with health behaviors. The present study contributes to research on motivation and eating behaviors by examining (1) how autonomous motivation is correlated within parent-adolescent dyads and (2) whether parent- and adolescent-reported autonomous motivation predicts the parent- adolescent correlation in fruit and vegetable (FV) intake frequency. Methods: Data were drawn from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study, a cross-sectional U.S. survey of parent- adolescent dyads led by the National Cancer Institute and fielded between April and October 2014. In 2016, data were analyzed from dyads who had responses on a six-item self-report measure of daily frequency of FV consumption and a two-item self-report measure of autonomous motivation for consuming FVs. Results: Parents' and adolescents' reports of autonomous motivation and FV intake frequency were positively correlated. Both parents' and adolescents' autonomous motivation predicted higher levels of their own FV intake frequency and that of their dyad partner (p-values <= 0.001). These effects of autonomous motivation explained 22.6% of the parent- adolescent correlation in FV intake frequency. Actor effects (one's motivation predicting their own FV intake frequency) were stronger than partner effects (one's motivation predicting their partner's FV intake frequency). Conclusions: Parent-adolescent similarity in autonomous motivation for healthy eating may contribute to similarity in eating behaviors. Future research should further examine how individual-level health behavior correlates influence health behaviors within dyads.
Sociology	This article considers several features of tech cities and masculine technology culture and their impact on the conditions of work and interactions of professionals working within them. It uses interdisciplinary perspectives of gender, technology culture, and professional identity and status to understand work in tech cities. Using focus groups involving 60 women and men across different professional backgrounds at three tech city sites in the UK and USA, the article examines the extent of change in work roles and status norms in a highly male-dominated sector and physical space. Professional life in tech cities is shaped by 'points of contact', characterised by heightened knowledge and awareness of masculine culture that restricts women's progression. Three such points of contact are identified. As increased scholarly and policy attention is paid to the lack of diversity in tech, this study contributes to a much-needed shift in tech culture. Attitudes and professional identities built around work and social networking in tech cities reveal the importance of professional communities and networks in supporting women to manage rejection and career barriers.
International Relations	This article seeks to explain the impact of Muslim politics on the Indonesian nation and, in particular, why Islamism has found so little political traction. It argues that Islamist ideas were late in emerging in modern Indonesia, and long remained marginal to Indonesians' ideas of what their nation should be and do. It notes, however, that Indonesia's deepening Islamisation has resulted in a sense of growing sectarianism and a developing accommodation of Islamic agendas by Indonesia's pseudo-secular state that requires careful management if respectful pluralism and mutual tolerance is to be maintained.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	The ways that we have invented for knowing young people are governmentalised. This governmentalisation produces powerful incentives to conform to the rule-bound and institutionalised knowledge practices that institutions, government departments, corporations, and NGOs understand as being capable of telling truths about young people and about risk. I argue that knowledge practices in the social sciences should trouble what counts as truth, as evidence, and the ways in which these truths can be produced. These interests will be examined through a discussion of the ways in which Tim Winton's novel Breath can be read as an allegorical tale about the terror of being ordinary: and of the teenage years as being a time in a life in which the fear of being ordinary compels Winton's key characters to seek out, sometimes stumble upon that which promises to make their's a life less ordinary. Here risk is something that breathes energy and purpose into lifeworlds that are dominated by the institutionalised ordinariness of family, school, and work. As an allegorical tale told from the vantage point of hindsight, Breath unsettles what it is that the social sciences can tell us about youth (as becoming) and risk (as mitigated by prudential foresight).
Area Studies	China has adopted a state-centered approach towards energy security to deepen political and commercial relationships with all energy producing nations and to aggressively invest in oil fields and pipelines around the world. Applying this approach to its relations with its Asia-Pacific neighbors has produced mixed results. While China's energy diplomacy has brought about opportunities for cooperation with some of its neighbors, notably some countries in Central Asia and continental Southeast Asia, it has become a source of conflict with some other neighbors, especially those with border disputes over maritime territories which may have rich natural resources. This paper examines China's state-led search for energy security and its implications for China's relations with Asia-Pacific countries.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article traces the history of the ongoing tension between Thailand and Cambodia over a beautiful Khmer temple located on the unresolved border between the two countries. The struggle is noteworthy for its transethnic character, the deep and imbricated history of the players, and the fight's intersection with dramatic contemporary politics in both countries. The paper argues that the dispute implicates existential challenges to ancient and contemporary political legitimacy. It emphasizes the significant role iconic sites can play in the construction of national identity as well as in the competitive global tourism market. The paper questions UNESCO cultural heritage policy concerning contested nominations to the World Heritage List and offers a recommendation for future treatment of similar cases.
Industrial Relations & Labor	Between 1984 and 2004, the dampening effect of children on the labor force participation of 25- to 44-year-old single women disappeared, while, for married women, it fell much more slowly, especially after 1993; for married women with children younger than 3 years, the effect of those children on their mothers' participation in 2004 was as large as it was in 1989 and greater than it was in 1993
Education & Educational Research	In recent decades, the field of art education has seen an increasing interest in issues of social justice and social reconstruction which has led to pre-service art educators often being encouraged to include potentially controversial topics in their pedagogy. Surprisingly, however, there seems to have been little concurrent discussion concerning the inherent risks involved in introducing polemical themes within the classroom. Indeed, despite its obvious importance, the subject of censorship is often given little attention in art education circles, save for when it has already become an active problem, such as when an instructor is accused of censorship by a student, or when forces outside the classroom seek to involve themselves in pedagogical decisions. In this article, I describe my experience creating and implementing an undergraduate pre-service art education course on the subject of censorship. I begin by examining my students' reactions to some of the themes explored, and then explain how discussing cases of art censorship and controversy can serve as a platform for introducing students to the key role that context plays in how we perceive, value and react to artworks. Finally, I make the argument that by including censorship as a subject within their curriculum, teachers can help students better to navigate the psychological, moral and ethical complexities of contemporary art making.
Public Administration	The resurgence of New Right politics in the late 1970s and 1980s (e.g. Reaganomics' and Thatcherism'), which were pro-market and pro-private sector (Lorenz, 2012), has increased the reliance on the private sector for the provision of public services. In France, the support for the private sector is no longer a partisan or ideological issue, but rather a pragmatic and increasingly routine approach to the delivery of public services. Whether this will improve the efficiency of the health-care system is still open to question. The article: investigates the use of the New Public Management toolbox (Goldfinch and Wallis, 2009: 151) in the French health-care system; examines its selective adoption; and assesses its impact on the accountability and transparency of the medical profession. The French government eventually opted for a re-centralization of the health-care system for monitoring purposes. The reforms antagonized the medical profession and strengthened private care providers. Point for practitioners Despite reiterated calls for devolution, the implementation of New Public Management in the French health-care system led to a greater re-centralization and rising regulations for efficiency purposes. It also allowed the French administrative elite to regain its prerogatives and regional health agencies to reform more rapidly than a multitude of local public organizations. The quest for greater accountability remains an ongoing process.
Business, Finance	In a little-noticed report released last spring, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) revised its ten-year-old estimate of the amount of undiscovered, technically recoverable crude oil in the Bakken formation that sprawls across much of North Dakota and Montana. The USGS said it now believes the formation contains at least 3 billion barrels of crude-a 25-fold increase from its earlier projection of 157 million barrels.
History Of Social Sciences	In 1962, anthropologist Carleton Coon argued in The Origin of Races that some human races had evolved further than others. Among his most vocal critics were geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky and anthropologist Ashley Montagu, each of whom had known Coon for decades. I use this episode, and the long relationships between scientists that preceded it, to argue that scientific research on race was intertwined not only with political projects to conserve or reform race relations, but also with the relationships scientists shared as colleagues. Demarcation between science and pseudoscience, between legitimate research and scientific racism, involved emotional as well as intellectual labor.
Ethnic Studies	Seven of India's 29 states enforce 'anti-conversion' laws, which are designed to prevent individuals and groups from converting or attempting to convert, either directly or otherwise, persons through 'forcible' or 'fraudulent' means, including 'allurement' or 'inducement.' This might seem a noble enough goal; nevertheless, we argue that anti-conversion laws actually serve to generate violent anti-Christian persecution by creating a culture of vigilantism in the states where such laws exist. This article empirically tests this proposition, along with alternative hypotheses, using a time-series, negative binomial analysis of the Indian states from 2000 to 2015. Our analysis finds that states that enforce anti-conversion laws are indeed statistically more likely to give rise to violent persecution against Christians than states where such laws do not exist. The statistical analysis is supplemented with a brief case study of Madhya Pradesh.
Information Science & Library Science	This article introduces a method for identifying potential opportunities of innovation arising from the convergence of different technological areas, based on the presence of edge outliers in a patent citation network. Edge outliers are detected via the assessment of their centrality; pairs of patents connected by edge outliers are then analyzed for technological relatedness and past involvement in technological convergence. The pairs with the highest potential for future convergence are finally selected and their keywords combined to suggest new directions of innovation. We illustrate our method on a data set of US patents in the field of digital information and security.
Demography	This article examines the political rationales at work behind the particularly repressive 2006 Costa Rican immigration law and subsequent immigration reform process and resulting 2010 law through an analysis of two rival framings of immigration in Costa Rica. First, I examine how the rushed nature of the 2006 law constructed a crisis in which migrants, particularly Nicaraguans, represented urgent threats to national security. Next, I examine the 2010 law that emerged from the reform process and the alternative framings of immigration as an issue of human rights and integration that migration advocates contributed to the new law. I argue that the juxtaposition of integration and security frameworks in the new law reinforces the law's most repressive measures, contributing to an overall project of securitization and marginalization of immigrants.
Education, Special	The authors sought to (a) identify interventions that immediately increased the oral reading fluency of students with or at risk for disabilities, (b) estimate to what extent these gains maintained over time, and (c) evaluate whether particular characteristics of students (e.g., gender, disability status) predicted their response to fluency interventions. We used multilevel modeling to meta-analyze results from 44 single-participant studies involving 290 students. Results indicated that goal setting immediately increased fluency, and this gain continued over time. Word-level training was largely ineffective. Students with some types of disabilities (i.e., those with behavioral disorders or autism) responded significantly less well to interventions targeting fluency than did students with other types of disabilities (i.e., those with learning disabilities or visual impairments) and so may require more intensive and individualized fluency interventions.
Family Studies	This study considers how the number of sisters and brothers affects the flow of aid from older parents to adult children. Using data from the 2004 Middletown Kinship Survey (N = 338), the authors find that the aid adults receive from their parents varies by the gender composition of the sibship. Adults with more sisters tend to receive less assistance from their older parents. This holds true across a range of helping behaviors, including financial, gifts, transportation, housework and yard work, and technology. The pattern does not hold for brothers. Possible explanations include resource dilution (daughters drawing more on parents' resources, leaving fewer resources to go around) or cooperative networks created among sisters (thus rendering aid from parents less necessary).
Business, Finance	This paper questions the ideal of comparability, which is often mobilized by standard setters when justifying new - or 'improvement' to existing - accounting standards. The target of our analysis is constituted by the thoughts of sophisticated users of financial statements when reflecting about International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation in Europe. Drawing on the work of Mary Douglas on purity and Michel Foucault on docility, it is argued and shown that sophisticated users tend to interpret aberrations - that is to say indications of incomparability which confront users in the flow of their professional lives - in ways that allow the ideal of comparability to be preserved. Important consequences ensuing from the docility of users in purifying aberrations are discussed.
Urban Studies	At Asuwei and Liulitun in Beijing, two similar NIMBY facilities were proposed. Why did one incinerator survive, while the other was aborted? This article aims at explaining this puzzle and finding a solution to address the NIMBY problem that happens all across China today. With thorough comparative case studies, this article argues that a knowledge-based participation initiated by a policy entrepreneur from the public is helpful in addressing this problem.
Cultural Studies	The recasting of laicite in France between 2002 and 2012 constituted a channel through which succeeding right-wing governments endeavoured to secure a form of cultural hegemony. This article focuses on the period 2002-7. The process leading to the anti-veil legislation of 2004 under President Chirac revealed how this symbolically charged motif once associated with the left had been displaced and integrated into a traditional and restrictive right-wing culture-shaping programme. Interior minister Sarkozy's endeavours between 2002 and 2004 to fashion an institutional dialogue with Islam in France were initially at odds with Chirac's programme. However, by 2007, Sarkozy had changed tack to produce an alternative reframing of laicite, positively' celebrating the intertwining of national and Catholic cultures, whilst using Islam as a negative foil for the projection of that identity. This laid the groundwork for the subsequent hardening of laicite debates and the appropriation of the term by the far right.
Urban Studies	In the Global South, the notion of the right to the city has increasingly been used to challenge the effects of uneven development on vulnerable informal residents. Yet, under a neoliberal spatial regime, acknowledging rights of informal residents does not necessarily lead to increasing access to the opportunities that cities produce. The article documents a contradictory process of, simultaneously, institutionalization of rights and implementation of profit-driven urban investments associated with 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is based on local-level, case-specific analysis of a dispute around the mega-event mobility investments and the demands of residents of Lagamara low-income, informal community in Fortalezaadopting participant observation methods during a 3-year field research period. The case illustrates how Brazilian right to the city policies have gone beyond the mere recognition of land rights of informal residents, yet they have fallen short of addressing the needs of the urban poor, highlighting the role of mega-event investments in this process. The contradiction of simultaneously expanding and eroding the rights of the urban poor in Brazil has given room for manipulative state practices that I have called undoing the right to the city.
History Of Social Sciences	In the spring of 2017, the Research Network on Regional Economic and Policy History organized its inaugural workshop in London. The network aims to stimulate research in relation to regional economic development and planning challenges, by exploring the importance of historical approaches and methodologies whilst uncovering linkages between historical science and regional studies. The added value of an historical perspective is that it assists in revealing path dependencies in a region's economy. Moreover, it can provide learnings in terms of the successes and failures of policy instruments, strategies, and institutions that are responsible for the implementation of regional policy. Furthermore, history can provide much-needed 'thick' descriptions which highlight contingencies. This contribution first explores the perspectives for interdisciplinary exchange between the study of history and the fields of regional and planning studies. Subsequently, it provides an outline of the aims and objectives, key activities, and participants of the network.
History Of Social Sciences	When the European metropolises were on the tortuous path to decolonialization in a complex relationship of power and culture, Spain, a country whose colonial interests in Africa had never been on the scale of those of other European countries, made one last attempt to control the territory with an administrative change, embarking on ambitious urban planning processes and new forms of social housing through a modern architecture which took into consideration the contemporary discourse present in the rest of the continent at the time. Specifically, from 1961 onwards, the National Institute of Housing executed several projects; this paper examines those directed by the architect Ramon Estalella y Manso de Zuniga in the city of Sidi Ifni (Morocco) and the two most important cities of Western Sahara, Laayoune and Dakhla. The complex power relationships, the political atmosphere and cultural interferences prompted a series of projects which attempted to provide unique and exceptionally creative urban and architectural solutions.
Ethnic Studies	Many Americans believed that the 2008 election of Barack Obama would usher in a new era in race relations. Instead, the increased competition represented by his victory, combined with the economic stagnation of the Great Recession, gave rise to the Tea Party Movement. The Tea Party is the latest in a long line of radical conservative revolts to be fueled by White nationalism. Tea Partiers-the overwhelming majority of whom are White, male, and staunchly conservative-are dissatisfied with government and categorically reject Obama, as they believe him to be both un-American and dangerously foreign.
Social Work	The aim of this study is to better understand perceptions of frontline social service workers who are not addiction specialists but have to address addiction-related issues during their standard services. Six social service organizations implemented a validated alcohol assessment and brief education intervention. After a 3-month trial implementation period, a convenience sample of 64 frontline providers participated in 6 focus groups to examine barriers and facilitators to the implementation of an alcohol screening and brief intervention. Three themes emerged: a) usefulness of the intervention, b) intervention being an appropriate fit with the agency and client population, and c) worker commitment and proper utilization during the implementation process. A cross-cutting theme that emerged was the context in which the intervention was implemented, as this was central to each of the 3 primary themes identified from the focus groups (i.e., the usefulness and appropriateness of the intervention and the implementation process overall). Practitioner buy-in concerns also indicate the need for better addiction service training opportunities for those without addiction-specific educational backgrounds. Future research should assess whether targeted trainings increase addiction screening and education in social services settings.
Business	Virtual work has become an increasingly important part of the international business environment. In particular, two components of virtual work; workplace mobility and distributed work, depicting physical and psychological distance to the workplace, have gained substantial scholarly attention. However, while the Main stream of the international business literature, studying global virtual teams, has used mobility and distribution as predictors for negative work outcomes, there are indications that virtual work can have positive implications for the organization. In this study, we explore how workplace mobility and distributed work can affect employees' perceptions of their colleagues and of managerial activities. More specifically, we focus on inclusive language use by managers and employees since this is a theme of growing interest in international business research. Relying on responses from 676 individuals from five Danish multicultural business organizations, we demonstrate a positive association between workplace mobility and perceptions of employees' openness to language diversity as well as between distributed work and perceptions of consistent common corporate language at management level. This is consistent with construal level theory predicting that distance between employees and the organization will lead to more objective and goal-oriented perceptions whereas individuals that are more emerged in organizational social life will view issues more in relation to goal irrelevant factors.

Social Issues	Grandparents who have primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren are increasingly on research and social policy agendas in Australia and elsewhere. Little is known, however, about the diversity in circumstances and experiences among grandparents in these caring relationships, and assumptions about the homogeneity of grandparents are often embedded in policy prescriptions and academic discourse. This paper explores the experiences and circumstances of grandparent carers at different ages and lifecourse stages, focusing on income, employment, housing, health, and social relationships. The analysis also considers the gendered nature of grandparent care, which is predominantly carried out by women. Findings are derived from an Australia-wide survey of 335 grandparent carers. The analysis distinguishes between younger (under 55 years), middle-aged (55-64) and older grandparents (65 and over) in order to explore differences and similarities in the interconnections of age and care. The article contributes to an age-sensitive theory of care and to considerations of social policies that recognise the costs to grandparents of raising their grandchildren at different ages and lifecourse stages.
Transportation	In the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (VRPMTW), a single time window must be selected for each customer from the multiple time windows provided. Compared with classical vehicle routing problems with only a single time window per customer, multiple time windows increase the complexity of the routing problem. To minimize the duration of any given route, we present an exact polynomial time algorithm to efficiently determine the optimal start time for servicing each customer. The proposed algorithm has a reduced worst-case and average complexity than existing exact algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed exact algorithm can be used to efficiently evaluate neighborhood operations during a local search resulting in significant acceleration. To examine the benefits of exact neighborhood evaluations and to solve the VRPMTW, the proposed algorithm is embedded in a simple metaheuristic framework generating numerous new best known solutions at competitive computation times.
Social Issues	Present day welfare societies rely on a complex mix of different providers ranging from the state, markets, family, and non-profit organizations to unions, grassroots organizations, and informal networks. At the same time changing welfare discourses have opened up space for new partnerships, divisions of labor, and responsibilities between these actors. For nonprofit organizations this means that they operate in complex institutional environments where different institutions and logics compete with each other. In this special issue we have collected a number of articles that analyze how organizations and organizational fields adjust to a new environment that is increasingly dominated by the logic of the market, and how in particular nonprofit organizations, as hybrids by definition, are able to cope with new demands, funding structures, and control mechanism.
Education, Special	The increase in the number of students with disabilities and special health care needs and their need for health care transition (HCT) creates opportunity for education and health services professionals to work together. In response to this opportunity, the authors developed an HCT teaching module for 6th to 12th graders. A concern that surfaced during the project was the sharing of personal health information by students during health-related instructional activities. The authors' concern evolved into a review of the confidentiality guidelines found in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Family Education Rights and Privacy Acts of 1974, and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and their relationship to educational activities. This article describes what the authors discovered and its application to HCT instruction.
Environmental Studies	Aggregates represent one of the largest material flows in the UK economy; however, the importance of these minerals in underpinning economic activity is frequently not recognised. Features such as the spatial imbalance between resources and demand centres, exacerbated by changes in demographics and public perception, are placing increased pressure on the planning system to maintain supply. This paper sets out the direct and indirect economic contributions made by the indigenous aggregates industry to the English economy through Gross Value Added and employment sustained. It describes the key role of aggregates in construction activities, assesses the links between infrastructure development and economic growth. In 2005, aggregates extraction directly contributed 810 million of Gross Value Added to the English economy. Primary aggregates are, however, extracted at a cost to the environment and this cost, based on amenity value reduction, is estimated by updating previously published contingent valuation data. Estimates for the costs associated with carbon dioxide emissions are derived from values published by the European Union and, separately, by the UK Government. These two elements combined result in an environmental cost of indigenous extraction of 445 million in 2005. Additionally, an examination of the potential for a significant increase in the level of aggregate imports into England is made and the consequences assessed. This includes an evaluation of shipping costs and port capacity, and concludes that there are significant barriers to any substantial increase in the level of aggregate imports into England. As a consequence, indigenous supply is likely to predominate into the foreseeable future. (C) 2011 NERC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Communication	Drawing on literature about the different television coverage of male and female politicians and gender-specific leadership behavior, differences in the visibility of female and male politicians' emotions on television can be assumed. These assumptions are particularly relevant when considering studies on the effects of politician's emotional displays on voters' assessments. In order to examine the prevalence of female and male politicians' emotions, we conducted a visual media content analysis of about 1,000 video sequences based on a sample of 66 news broadcasts. Since this comprehensive sample includes video sequences of German politicians holding various positions within the political system, it enables us to draw generalizable conclusions on the televised emotionality of leading politicians. We find that female politicians' emotions can be seen more frequently on television than male politicians' emotions. Moreover, female politicians' positive emotions are shown more frequently than those of male politicians.
Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	"In multi-national surveys, different countries usually implement different sample designs. The sample designs affect the variance of estimates of differences between countries. When making such estimates, analysts often fail to take sufficient account of sample design. This failure occurs sometimes because variables indicating stratification, clustering, or weighting are unavailable, partially available, or in a form that is unsuitable for cross-national analysis. In this article, we demonstrate how complex sample design should be taken into account when estimating differences between countries, and we provide practical guidance to analysts and to data producers on how to deal with partial or inappropriately-coded sample design indicator variables. Using EU-SILC as a case study, we evaluate the inverse misspecification effect (imeff) that results from ignoring clustering or stratification, or both in a between-country comparison where countries"" sample designs differ. We present imeff for estimates of between-country differences in a number of demographic and economic variables for 19 European Union Member States. We assess the magnitude of imeff and the associated impact on standard error estimates. Our empirical findings illustrate that it is important for data producers to supply appropriate sample design indicators and for analysts to use them."
Social Work	"This article examines the ways in which childhood mortality as an ideological tool is constituted as a shared moral order in modern society. The examination of record-keeping as an ideological practice that produces a governable and self-regulating population allows us to identify how and where it is incorporated into social life as an everyday morality. Under this moral order, death must be constituted as a medical necessity, rendering it culturally relevant, in order for social life to continue to be considered a meaningful and purposeful endeavour. The child""s status in society as a sacred citizen ensures that children""s deaths are constituted in even more particular ways, so that the possibility of medically ""unnecessary"" child death remains morally unthinkable and thus does not expose the ideological underpinnings that continue to produce social life as a moral and thus meaningful affair.

Urban Studies	"The Intelligenter Method is based on the innovative idea of collaborations discovery in urban systems. The Intelligenter Method shows that what makes an urban project, masterplan, policy, or regulation smart is not its sophisticated architecture and master planning, nor complexity and legal engineering in a technological environment, but rather qualitative and quantitative collaborations that urban subsystems being studied can establish with related subsystems and stakeholders. Furthermore, this safeguards sustainability while promoting urban development and improving resilience. This Method is also applicable to intelligenter urban planning and city projects. This first part of the methodology is published in a separate paper in this Cities issue with the title The Intelligenter Method (I) for making ""smarter"" city projects and plans.

Development Studies	Since 1999, poor countries that want to qualify for concessionary IMF loans and debt relief must elaborate and implement Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Donors claim that the PRSP approach will increase aid effectiveness since PRSPs will enhance broad country ownership and lead to better 'partnership' with donors, implying more donor co-ordination under government leadership. By examining the experiences of Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua, this article finds that the results are disappointing. The article also shows that, by emphasising rational planning and ignoring politics, the PRSP approach has unintended and sometimes harmful consequences. This leads to recommendations for changes of the approach.
Environmental Studies	Recent studies provide compelling evidence for the idea that creative thinking draws upon two kinds of processes linked to distinct physiological features, and stimulated under different conditions. In short, the fast system-I produces intuition whereas the slow and deliberate system-II produces reasoning. System-I can help see novel solutions and associations instantaneously, but is prone to error. System-II has other biases, but can help checking and modifying the system-I results. Although thinking is the core business of science, the accepted ways of doing our work focus almost entirely on facilitating system-II. We discuss the role of system-I thinking in past scientific breakthroughs, and argue that scientific progress may be catalyzed by creating conditions for such associative intuitive thinking in our academic lives and in education. Unstructured socializing time, education for daring exploration, and cooperation with the arts are among the potential elements. Because such activities may be looked upon as procrastination rather than work, deliberate effort is needed to counteract our systematic bias.
Geography	River discharge from partly glacier-covered catchments is controlled by its storage on various time scales and its release from ice and snow during melt-out. These discharge processes depend on seasonal reactions to meteorological conditions, generating variable river discharge magnitudes, including floods. Four types of meteorologically driven floods in glacier-covered catchments were distinguished, depending on the seasonal variations in the dominant water supply source and the type of storage. These four types of floods were induced by: 1 - spring/summer snow-melt; 2 - mid-summer ice and snow-melt; 3 - rainfall events, and 4 - fohn phenomena. Additionally, sudden water drainage from ice-dammed lakes of various origins may generate amounts of discharge surpassing total annual discharge. Flooding events from the High Arctic glacier-covered catchments in the area between Billefjorden and Wijdefjorden, in the central part of Spitsbergen (Svalbard), were characterised. Floods occurred more than once per ten days during the ablation season. These floods are considered the main agents of proglacial relief remodelling, sediment transport and deposition.
Business, Finance	Bivariate EGARCH models are used to investigate mean and volatility spillovers across major global copper futures markets before and after the Global Financial Crisis. We show that the overall magnitude and significance of information spillovers strengthen after the crisis. The exogenous shocks not only exhibit considerable information spillovers on copper futures markets but also enhance information transmission among them, including bi-directional mean and volatility spillovers and long-run equilibrium. Moreover, our results shed light on the growing importance of the Shanghai Copper futures market in information transmission. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark
Economics	This article analyses the relationship between the comparative advantages of bank branches and the trade area environment. Bank branches are points of sale whose trade environment influences their activities and performance. Comparative advantages are defined, for each output mix, by the strict dominance of a production technology in a specific trade area over the production technologies of other environments. Using Shephard's output distance functions on a sample of 728 bank branches, we compare the production technologies for different output mixes and different trade environments. We show that none of the production technologies strictly dominates the others and none of them is strictly dominated. Therefore, each trade area benefits from comparative advantages that we try to highlight. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the central banks regarding their ability to provide the right incentives on output mixes to their bank branches so that the latter may benefit from their comparative advantages.
Substance Abuse	"This study examined racial differences across African-American, Hispanic, and White participants in the impact that individual and social risk factors have on drinking behavior trajectories. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health from seventh through ninth graders (N = 4,372) were used. Participants reported on frequency of drinking across the four waves and risk factors at Wave 1. Growth mixture modeling revealed four trajectories for alcohol use that included Abstainers, Early Starters, Late Starters, and De-Escalators. Social and individual indicators of risk were differently predictive of group membership to the problematic drinking trajectories. Differences across racial groups suggested that a lack of future orientation may be a salient risk factor for African-American and Hispanic youths"" alcohol use, and peer alcohol use may be a salient risk factor for White youths"" alcohol use. The findings of this study suggest that there may be individual differences in risk factors that provide insight for prevention efforts."
Business, Finance	This paper provides a simple framework to study the effect of disagreement in a multi-asset market equilibrium by considering two agents who disagree about expected returns, variances, and correlation of returns of two risky assets. When agents' subjective beliefs are characterized by mean preserving spreads of a benchmark homogeneous belief, we show that the effect of the disagreement does not cancel out in general and the effect in a multi-asset market can be very different from a single asset market. In particular, the market risk premium can increase and the risk-free rate can decrease significantly even when the market is overoptimistic and overconfident.
Ethnic Studies	At the intersection of feminism and postcolonial theory is an acrimonious debate over female genital cutting (FGC). I subject this debate to an analysis in order to separate productive from destructive discursive strategies. I find that both FGC and the literature about the practice are frequently mischaracterized in consequential ways. Especially prior to the mid-1990s, scholars frame FGC as an example of either cultural inferiority or cultural difference. In the 1990s, postcolonial scholars contest the framing of FGC as a measure of cultural inferiority. However, they often argue that Western feminist engagement with FGCs, writ large, is 'imperialist'. I contend that both accusations of African 'barbarism' and of Western feminist 'imperialism' are empirically false and inflammatory. Furthermore, reifying 'African' and 'Western' perspectives erases African opposition to FGC and Western feminist acknowledgement of transnational power asymmetry. I conclude with a discussion of the role of outrage in academic scholarship.
Women'S Studies	The women's movement and feminism have been transnational endeavors from their very beginnings. Although the routes transnationality took in practice were more limited than claims to global sisterhood suggested, the history of feminist politics is characterized by a variety of more or less parochial transnational entanglements. Realizing feminist theory's simultaneously translocal and situated character has undoubtedly been one of the most productive learning processes of the last three decades. The article traces how the development of germanophone feminist theory is inseparably bound to debates that have taken place in Anglo-American feminism, in particular the sex/gender debate. At the same time, however, it demonstrates how profoundly its questions and perspectives are marked by the specific experiences and scholarly traditions of this context. Two characteristics relevant in both the early years and today are its pronounced historical orientation and emphasis on complex social-theoretical approaches. Current developments, in particular the discussions on gender, class, and ethnicity as intersecting axes of inequality and difference, are reinvigorating feminist engagement in developing general social theory.
Nursing	Expensive simulation equipment continues to sit idle in nursing learning and teaching environments. To identify factors that influence nursing educator comfort in the use of simulation at an Australian university an explorative qualitative research project was undertaken using an interpretative constructivist methodology. The Goodwin et al. (2007) adapted Comfort Theory for nursing education has been used. The aim of the study was to identify factors that influence nurse educator's comfort in the use of simulation. Research question asked was: What are the barriers and enhancers to using simulation as a learning and teaching modality. Thematic analysis of data from focus groups on four different campus sites was undertaken. Four themes identified that affected participants' comfort in this study were: 1) Personal barriers; 2) Human resource barriers; 3) Structural barriers and 4) Suggestions to address barriers. Further understanding of the themes and how they relate to educator comfort with simulation are shared with the reader. The paper also outlines emerging recommendations to improve educator comfort.
Sociology	"Using Swedish panel data, we assess whether the gender gap in supervisory authority has changed during the period 1968-2000, and investigate to what extent the gap can be attributed to gender-specific consequences of family formation. The results indicate that the gap has narrowed modestly during the period, and that the life-event of parenthood is a major cause. As long as women and men are childless and single, the gender gap in supervisory authority is marginal, even reversed. When men become fathers, however, they strongly increase their chances for supervisory authority whereas women's chances remain unaffected when they become mothers. We also find a male ""marriage premium"" on workplace authority, but this premium is generated by selection."
Substance Abuse	Few previous studies have reported on the overall health of drug-using women. To investigate this, 696 low-income women aged 18-31 were recruited in a cross-sectional study from gynecological care clinics in Texas between 2001 and 2003. Compared to exclusive marijuana users and non-drug users, women who used MDMA and those who used other illicit drugs but not MDMA reported more gynecological conditions, medical conditions, depressive symptoms, and physical somatic complaints. We concluded that young. low-income women who used more than one illicit drug experience significantly more physical and psychological morbidity. Generalization of this study results may be limited to young women with low income but not to other populations.
Ethnic Studies	Discrimination is a problem for both minority groups and the societies in which they live. Perceived group discrimination reflects the direct experiences of immigrants but is also an indicator of reception context and social cohesion in the host country. This paper examines perceptions of group discrimination among recently migrated Polish immigrants to four Western European countries, and specifically focuses on changes over time in these individual perceptions, using a new longitudinal survey of immigrants. Are there cross-national differences in (changes in) perceived group discrimination, and how is discrimination related to exposure to and experiences in the host country? By employing a panel design we find that perceived discrimination is higher among Polish migrants in the Netherlands in Wave 1 than in the other three countries; perceptions of discrimination also increase more there between waves of the survey, as well as in the UK. Perceptions of group discrimination are related to some aspects of exposure to the host country, but most strongly associated with negative experiences in the host country. Differences in country contexts - attitudinal climate and national discourses - seem to play a role in understanding perceived group discrimination among new Polish immigrants in Western Europe.
Environmental Studies	Environmental sustainability is one of the frameworks for cooperation under the Declaration of ASEAN Concord II, 2015. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been recognized as a crucial tool. This paper proposes the review of EIA in ASEAN countries in three key areas, namely legal enforcement, implementation approach and EIA effectiveness as the basis for a sustainable approach. The results showed that almost all the countries established their EIAs at the legal level with the complete EIA process; however, the implementation was somewhat different depending on the unique characteristics of the EIA processes. Such unique characteristics can be divided into three groups. The first belongs to the countries that initiated the EIA process before 1990, although they have their own outstanding topography, namely, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The second group includes the countries that applied the EIA after 1990. The Asian Development Bank has played an active role and their EIA processes have rapidly developed especially EIA monitoring, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Transboundary Impact Assessment. The countries in this group are Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. The last group contains the countries with stringent environmental regulations and is becoming part of environmental laws. They include Singapore and Brunei. The tools to support the achievement of sustainability, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity offsets and transboundary impacts will be of prime importance to the ASEAN EIA in the future.
Sociology	This paper provides an overview of some of the main theories of the welfare state. It builds upon Polanyi's theory of the double-movement and relates this to Bourdieu's concept of multiple capitals. It argues that the welfare state can be understood as a form of public capital, both in an economic and sociological sense. The welfare state emerges and is maintained due to a social countermovement that at least partly removes areas of socio-economic life out of commodity relations. In turn this creates public capital, which is both economic and social. In the post-Communist countries most of this public capital was created during a period when almost the whole of economic and social life was controlled by the state. Once the Communist system collapsed, so the accompanying policy of full-employment and system of social welfare organised through state enterprises disappeared. This was met with a large rise in unemployment and labour deactivation, meaning that many social benefits were created during the initial years of the transition. Also, the post-Communist systems inherited large amounts of public capital in the form of public services such as health and education. Through the example of Poland this paper analyses how this public capital was initially maintained and even developed during the early transition period, but then how a process of commodifying it was later begun.
Environmental Studies	The distribution of decisional power and ability of local communities to participate in natural hazard risk governance (NHRG) are critical success factors for sustainable development. This article assesses the evolution of power distribution and participation at the local level in NHRG using bibliometric and international discourse analysis. The results show that participation-related concepts are underrepresented in NHRG, compared to environmental resource management and community & livelihood development fields of research. This implies the existence of societal/community barriers that impede the development of a sustainable paradigm in NHRG. In addition, when present, participation is mostly passive (non-decisional), a finding also observed in the representation of these concepts in the international discourse of United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). For sustainable NHRG, it is necessary to have explicit targets of authentic and long-term support for active community involvement with a planned share of power. This prescription is supported by unequivocal references in the recent (2010-2011) international discourse of UNISDR.
Urban Studies	The new agricultural model in Chile involves the separation of agricultural work and rural life. Agriculture workers that urbanize along with non-agrarian workers that live in rural areas configure a new scheme in which daily mobility between work/productive spaces and those of habitat/reproduction conform one of the mechanisms that give form to agrarian territories. Its origin is linked to the new modes of rural-urban relations that have led to the modernization of Chilean agriculture in the last four decades. The commuting variable was of interest for two reasons: on the one hand, regarding the mass, volume and rates of intra-regional mobility; on the other hand, regarding the forms they configure, whether it involves commutes between two rural localities, between rural and urban (both principal and secondary), between urban and rural or between urban and urban. The analysis also considers the categories of agrarian workers, secondary and tertiary activity workers.
Family Studies	In May of 2008 the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute issued a report that questioned whether or not transracial adoption is truly in the best interest of the child, thus newly igniting the controversy over transracial adoption. While the research on this controversial topic is substantial, most Studies (including those cited in the Donaldson Report) are limited in their scope. Drawing from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with middle-class young black adults, this study offers a broader perspective on transracial adoption by focusing on a range of parent/child race relationships in a class context. The impact of racialized family structure on black identity development is examined by comparing the experiences of young black adults raised in families with two black parents (monoracial), one white and one black parent (biracial), and two white parents (transracial). This article also addresses a void in the literature by focusing on the impact socioeconomic class has on identity formation, particularly middle-class black identity. Results indicate that the formative experiences of young black adults who differ in terms of racialized family structure but share a class status are largely similar. These similarities challenge a number of assumptions that have been made in prior transracial adoption research.
Criminology & Penology	Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the South African Police Service (SAPS) has been confronted with the complex task of organisational transformation. This study explores the process of gender equitable reform in the SAPS in the post-apartheid period. Utilising a gendered organisations approach, this article focuses on the gendered nature of power in the police. Through an assessment of SAPS reform initiatives and their impacts, it argues that despite impressive advances in terms of representation at all levels of the organisation, systemic gender discrimination persists.
Economics	The impact of 39 swine confined or concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in Black Hawk County, Iowa on 5,822 house sales is explored by introducing a new variable that more accurately captures the effects of prevailing winds, exploring potential adverse effects within concentric circles around each CAFO, managing selection bias, and incorporating spatial correlation into the error term of the empirical model. Large adverse impacts suffered by houses that are within 3 miles and directly downwind from a CAFO are found. Beyond 3 miles, CAFOs have a generally decreasing adverse impact on house prices as distance to the CAFO increases.
Management	The increasing demand for reduced cost and improved quality of service in healthcare has prompted the call for better management of medical knowledge. The main emphasis has been on knowledge that is acquired through experience and medical research and then formalised into Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). This paper presents a generic approach to CPG information and knowledge management that uses the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rule paradigm and active databases within a unified management framework. The paper focuses on an approach for facilitating the use and management of CPGs by clinicians through delivering the CPGs at the point-of-care by a computerised mechanism.
Education, Special	The term parapatric speciation, borrowed from biogeography, is used as a metaphor for describing and illustrating a little acknowledged change in the field of early intervention that occurred at the time of the passage of the Education of the Handicapped Act Part H early intervention legislation. The term refers to the formation of a new species from a parent population that lives adjacent to but does not interact with the parent population. Up until the passage of the Part H legislation, early intervention was defined primarily in terms of the experiences, activities, and learning opportunities used to influence infant and toddler behavior and development. Thereafter, early intervention was redefined in terms of the professional services provided young children and their families. The paper includes a discussion of the consequences of the parapatric speciation of early intervention and why the Part H/Part C is in dire need of revision and updating and what those changes might look like.
Health Policy & Services	Background: In the United States, registered nurses (RNs) are trained through 1 of 3 educational pathways: a diploma course, an associate's degree, or a baccalaureate degree in nursing. A national consensus has emerged that the proportion of RNs who are baccalaureate trained should be substantially increased. Yet, achieving that goal may be difficult in areas where college graduates are unlikely to reside. Objectives: To determine whether the level of training of the hospital RN workforce varies geographically, along with the education of the local general workforce. Research Design: Cross sectional, ecological study. Subjects: Hospital nurses who participated in the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses in 2004 (N = 16,567). Measures: RN training was measured as Diploma, Associates degree, or Baccalaureate degree or above. County-level general workforce quality was assessed as the adult college graduation rate. Counties were divided into US population quartiles, with the highest quartile (Q4) having >29.3% college graduates, and the lowest quartile (Q1) having <16.93% college graduates. Results: Hospital RNs have a higher level of training in counties where the general population is better educated. For example, in Q4, 55.2% of hospital RNs are baccalaureate trained; in Q3, 50.2%; in Q2, 45.2%; and in Q1, 34.9% (P < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons). The association between RN training and general workforce education is found in cities, towns, and rural areas. Conclusions: Nationwide, there are substantial geographic variations in the training of hospital RNs. Educational segregation (the tendency for educated people to cluster geographically) may make it more difficult to achieve a baccalaureate degree in nursing-rich nursing workforce in some areas of the United States. Further work is needed to assess whether educational segregation similarly influences the distribution of other health-care professionals, and whether it leads to variations in the local quality of care.
History Of Social Sciences	The Carnegie Corporation's role as a patron of the behavioral sciences has been overlooked; its support for the behavioral sciences not only began earlier than the Ford Foundation's but was also at least equally important to their success. I show how the close postwar collaboration between the Carnegie Corporation and the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) to promote the behavioral sciences emerged after a struggle between Carnegie and the Rockefeller Foundation over the direction and leadership of the SSRC. I then focus on three postwar projects Carnegie helped conceive and fund that were publicized as the work of the SSRC: Chase's The Proper Study of Mankind (1948), Stouffer et al.'s The American Soldier (1949, 1950), and the Michigan's Survey Research Center 1952 election study. In each of these projects, Carnegie deliberately muted its own role and promoted the remade SSRC as a major advocate for the behavioral sciences. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Rehabilitation	Introduction: Older adults with mobility limitations are at greater risk for aging-related declines in physical function. Line dancing is a popular form of exercise that can be modified, and is thus feasible for older adults with mobility limitations. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 8 weeks of line dancing on balance, muscle strength, lower extremity function, endurance, gait speed, and perceived mobility limitations. Methods: An experimental design randomly assigned older adults to either an 8-week line dancing or usual care group. The convenience sample consisted of 23 participants with mobility limitations (age range: 65-93 years). The intervention used simple routines from novice line dance classes. At baseline and at 8 weeks, balance, knee muscle strength, lower extremity function, endurance, gait speed, and mobility limitations were measured. ANCOVA tests were conducted on each dependent variable to assess the effects of the intervention over time. Results: Results found significant positive differences for the intervention group in lower extremity function (p < 0.01); endurance (p < 0.01); gait speed (p < 0.001); and self-reported mobility limitations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Eight weeks of line dancing significantly improved physical function and reduced self-reported mobility limitations in these individuals. Line dancing could be recommended by clinicians as a potential adjunct therapy that addresses mobility limitations. Implications for Rehabilitation Line dancing may be an alternative exercise for older adults who need modifications due to mobility limitations. Line dancing incorporates cognitive and motor control. Line dancing can be performed alone or in a group setting. Dancing improves balance which can reduce risk of falls.
History & Philosophy Of Science	The robust behavior of the patent citation network is a complex target of recent bottom-up models in science. This paper investigates the purpose and testing of three especially simple bottom-up models of the citation count distribution observed in the patent citation network. The complex causal webs in the models generate weakly emergent patterns of behavior, and this explains both the need for empirical observation of computer simulations of the models and the epistemic harmlessness of the resulting epistemic opacity.
Education & Educational Research	This paper presents an empirical study about the narrative construction of identity associated with experiences of school failure. This study is based on the sociocultural notion of agency, according to which social contexts and cultural tools are key elements in the development and understanding of human beliefs, values and ways of acting (Wertsch, 1993). This paper is also influenced by poststructuralist theory, according to which emotions are socially organized and managed through social conventions of communities (Abu-Lughod & Lutz, 1990). From this point of view, emotions are ideological practices that serve specific purposes in the process of creating and negotiating meanings. This study endeavours to ascertain the mediational tools of cultural identity that are associated with school failure and the ensuing emotional discourses and conflicts that shape students' educational development. To do so, a qualitative methodology of the narrative type is used, applying an in-depth autobiographical interview. The sample of study is made up of 11 students from a cohort in a Social Guarantee Programme on Hotel Management in Seville. Five hundred and eighty-four utterances from autobiographical narratives were recorded and coded, and qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied for data analysis. Results show that the most frequent cultural tools in the autobiographical reports were associated with gender, thus indicating that sexist stereotypes are the most important cultural tools in the construction of identity and that students show a legitimizing attitude towards sexist stereotypes. In addition, a variety of autobiographical discourses were identified, expressing diverse sources of social influence and ways of relating with one's social setting. Lastly, the study reveals a set of emotional conflicts associated with social contexts and cultural tools and finds that conflicts linked with social aspirations and gender roles were the most frequent in the students' autobiographical reports and were also associated with dropping out of school.
Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	This article introduces encounters between the researcher and toddlers, in which the interaction is performed and data primarily constructed through the arts, and the encounters seen as aesthetic interviews. The aim of the article is to exemplify, explore, and discuss such an arts-based data gathering, and to elicit how understanding this as interviews may put forward other nuances of such a methodology. Although the method has obvious resemblances with observation methods, the energy and intervention on behalf of the researcher is most similar to the qualitative interview, keeping the relational qualities from the interview at the forefront. Exemplified by a fieldwork in a Norwegian day-care center and inspired by interview theories, early childhood research, arts-based research, and more, the article questions the dominance of the verbal language in interviews, and discusses the core of the interview as a relational interchange of views, dialogue, interaction, and as aesthetic habits of mind.
Social Sciences, Biomedical	Theoretical work on disability is going through an expansive period, built on the growing recognition of disability studies as a discipline and out of the political and analytical push to bring disability into a prominent position within accounts of the intersecting social categories that shape people's Lives. A current debate within critical disability studies is whether that study should include impairment and embodiment within its focus. This article argues it should and does so by drawing from symbolic interactionism and embodiment literatures in order to explore how differences in what bodies can do defined as impairments come to play a role in how people make sense of themselves through social interaction. We argue that these everyday interactions and the stories we tell within them and about them are important spaces and narratives through which impairment and disability are produced. Interactions and stories are significant both in how they are shaped by wider social norms, collective stories and institutional processes, and also how they at times can provide points of resistance and challenges to such norms, stories and institutions. Therefore, the significance of impairment and interaction is the role they play in both informing self-identity and also broader dynamics of power and inequality.

Industrial Relations & Labor	In this paper, we investigate the effects of works councils on apprenticeship training in Germany. The German law attributes works councils substantial information and co-determination rights to training-related issues. Thus, works councils may also have an impact on the cost-benefit relation of workplace training. Using detailed firm-level data containing information on the costs and benefits of apprenticeship training, we find that firms with works councils make a significantly higher net investment in training compared to firms without such an institution. We also find that the fraction of former trainees still employed with the same firm 5 years after training is significantly higher in the presence of works councils, thus enabling firms to recoup training investments over a longer time horizon. Furthermore, all works council effects are much more pronounced for firms covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Information Science & Library Science	Recently, an important public debate emerged about the digital afterlife of any personal data stored in the cloud. Such debate brings also to attention the importance of transparent management of electronic health record (EHR) data of deceased patients. In this perspective paper, we look at legal and regulatory policies for EHR data post mortem. We analyze observational research situations using EHR data that do not require institutional review board approval. We propose creation of a deceased subject integrated data repository (dsIDR) as an effective tool for piloting certain types of research projects. We highlight several dsIDR challenges in proving death status, informed consent, obtaining data from payers and healthcare providers and the involvement of next of kin.
Political Science	"Among the 30 titles from 2015, 22 are first translations, most of which come from contemporary literature. This literature likes to address the ""wild"" 1990s with their halfhearted reforms and painful distortions of political and social life (striking examples are the novel Liudi v avguste [People in August] by Sergei Lebedev, which has been repressed in Russia, and Aleksandr Ilichevskii's novel Matiss [Matisse]). Vladimir Sorokin sketches a grotesque vision of a mediaeval future for Russia in the novel Telluriia. Appearing for the first time in German are long forbidden works by Olga Berggolts, Mikhail Prishvin, and Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. Standouts among the new translations are Anton Chekhov's late short stories, as translated by Peter Urban, and Mikhail Osorgin's novel Quiet Street."
Development Studies	Evidence abounds in the rural livelihoods literature that rural households do not only receive a significant proportion of their incomes from non-farm sources, but also it is a significant source of employment for rural folks. This paper examines the pattern and determinants of non-farm income diversification in rural Ghana. Results show that off-farm income constituted 43 percent of rural household income in 2005/6. Female-headed households tend to have larger off-farm income shares compared to male-headed households. Non-farm income shares followed the same gender pattern albeit less pronounced. Unlike in Latin America and Asia, in rural Ghana, non-farm self-employment income is more important than non-farm wage-employment income. Regression results show that the gender composition of households, age, education, and access to credit, electricity and markets are important determinants of multiple non-farm activities and non-farm income. The findings call for strategies that can help rural households maximize the benefits from income diversification.
Communication	Drawing on focus group research, this article examines the impact of norms of publicity and privacy on young people as they negotiate technologically mediated intimate and peer relations. This article argues that digital images of bodies circulate online in manner that reinforces gender inequalities, as the public feminine body is conflated with pornography in contrast to the range of meanings that can append to the public masculine body. While the exposed female body was subject to pejorative ascriptions of sexual promiscuity, the exposed masculine body could serve a range of purposes, including its deployment in sexual harassment. Young people tended to ignore male perpetration and hold girls and women responsible for managing the risks of online abuse. The article underscores the need for a 'critical pedagogy' of online abuse, but it also argues that social media is rendering the homosociality and misogynist strains of online publics visible and therefore contestable.
Gerontology	Despite the fact that urbanisation, population ageing and international migration constitute major societal developments of our time, little attention has been paid to studying them together in a comprehensive manner. In this paper, we argue that, when treating age and ethnicity as practical processes for addressing and identifying with social groups, it is necessary to do so from a 'doing' perspective. The question we ask focuses on which social memberships are made relevant or irrelevant in residential environments and how that relevance or irrelevance is established. Drawing upon a quantitative study among individuals of Turkish migrant origin living in Vienna, Austria, we find that it is rather common for the respondents to have been assigned to multiple intersecting social groups and that they were treated unfairly in their own neighbourhoods. However, such ascriptions do not necessarily correspond to objective categorisations of research or subjective identifications. Hence, the discrimination that is present in a neighbourhood does not necessarily lead to decreased place attachment or a diminishing sense of home. In fact, we find that the 'satisfaction paradox' is quite common in environmental gerontology and that it may actually intersect with the 'immigration paradox'. Applying processual intersectionality is not only fruitful for research, it can also improve the conceptualisation of age-friendly cities.
Women'S Studies	"I expand upon Kristie Dotson's concept of ""epistemic violence"" by identifying another type of epistemic violence that arises in the context of nonverbal communication. ""Emotional misperception,"" as I call it, occurs when the following conditions are met: (1) A misreads B's nonlinguistic expression of emotion, (2) owing to reliable ignorance, (3) harming B."
Anthropology	Bioarchaeological approaches are well suited for examining past responses to political and environmental changes. In the Andes, we hypothesized that political and environmental changes around AD 1100 resulted in behavioral changes, visible as shifts in paleodiet and paleomobility, among individuals in the San Pedro de Atacama oases and Loa River Valley. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated carbon and oxygen isotope data from cemeteries dating to the early Middle Horizon (Larache, Quitor-5, Solor-3), late Middle Horizon (Casa Parroquial, Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, Solcor-Plaza, Solcor-3, Tchecar), and Late Intermediate Period (Caspana, Quitor-6 Tardio, Toconce, Yaye-1, Yaye-2, Yaye-3, Yaye-4). Carbon isotope data demonstrate a greater range of carbon sources during the late Middle Horizon compared with the Late Intermediate Period; while most individuals consumed largely C-3 sources, some late Middle Horizon individuals consumed more C-4 sources. Oxygen isotope data demonstrate greater diversity in drinking water sources during the late Middle Horizon compared with the Late Intermediate Period. Water samples were analyzed to provide baseline data on oxygen isotope variability within the Atacama Desert, and demonstrated that oxygen isotope values are indistinguishable in the San Pedro and Loa Rivers. However, oxygen isotope values in water sources in the high-altitude altiplano and coast are distinct from those in the San Pedro and Loa Rivers. In conclusion, instead of utilizing a wider variety of resources after environmental and political changes, individuals exhibited a wider range of paleodietary and paleomobility strategies during the Middle Horizon, a period of environmental and political stability.

Ethnic Studies	Since the maxim of Germany as a non-immigration country was finally relinquished at the end of the 20(th) century, the country has struggled with redefining itself as an immigration society and inventing a modified national identity. Our article argues that gender has come to play a pivotal role in this process of redefining a 'German' identity because it helps secure the 'self' by creating the Muslim/migrant 'other' as culturally different. Under the pretext of preventing women's rights violations, a renewed debate on integration and the duties of migrants is taking place. While we criticize the deployment of gender against the civic recognition of Muslims, violations of women's rights within minority groups do exist and must be combated. Our article offers some preliminary considerations as to how public agencies can intervene effectively against practices that are harmful to women, without in the process demonizing minority groups.
Education, Special	Ethical issues regarding children with disabilities have long involved their treatment after they are born. These issues remain important, but children may be deliberately created with or without characteristics that are usually thought of as disabilities. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and related technologies that involve human reproduction will become more readily available and raise new issues about the nature of disability and treatment of it. Special educators will face new challenges when children's disabilities are deliberately created. Suggestions are provided for constraining reproductive choices and for providing special education.
Law	Article 12 of the CRPD is often heralded as a 'paradigm shift' in the treatment of those with psychosocial disabilities. Historically, many persons with psychosocial disabilities have been treated as 'objects', without considering their expressions of will, even when they are capable of making decisions. That unacceptable status quo needed to change; yet, the shifts that have taken place - in a document such as the General Comment on Article 12 of the CRPD - actually reinforce the marginalisation of those with severe psychosocial disabilities and can harm their rights. The approach adopted in the General Comment does so, I argue, through reinforcing the traditional Kantlan philosophical tradition which roots the very value and rights of individuals in their capacity to be autonomous agents in the world. That paradigm, unfortunately, is deeply flawed in its failure to take account of those who lack autonomous agency and other decision-making capacities, yet whose lives can go better or worse; and its failure to recognise and honour the value that lies in dependency and passivity as well as agency. I provide an alternative account which attempts to address these shortcomings and embrace the rights of those who are dependent on care and largely passive whilst not diminishing the importance of autonomy and agency for others. I argue that South Africa should not follow the approach of the General Comment where it would jeopardise the rights of those with psychosocial disabilities and, instead, should, in its laws, give expression to the more normatively desirable approach articulated in this article.
Area Studies	The aim of this study is to determine primary school students' inclination to attend secondary education and explain the reasons why they fail to do so. The data were gathered from 584 students in eighth grade in 17 primary schools in 14 different cities. The data were collected through a questionnaire. It was found that there is a significant correlation between 8th-year primary school students' tendency to attend secondary school education and their fathers' professions, their parents' educational background and the number of their siblings (P<0,05). However, when gender was considered, no significant link was found. There seem to be 5 major reasons why these students cannot continue to receive education after primary education: 1. the family's inability to meet the child's school expenses 2. the student's failure to receive scholarship or get accepted to a secondary-education institution 3. the absence of a secondary school in the student's immediate hometown 4. the student's unwillingness to receive secondary education 5. the student's dislike of attending lessons.
Communication	This paper deploys Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory to examine the dispute over intellectual property protection and global HIV/AIDS medicines access. Over the 1980s and 1990s, major pharmaceutical companies and minority world governments successfully crafted a strong patent protection regime, institutionalized in the World Trade Organization's intellectual property rules. In the early 2000s, a transnational civil society campaign challenged this regime, positioning patents at the centre of a highly publicized dispute. This dispute has been retrospectively identified as a turning point in medicines access discourse, with the 2001-2003 period dubbed the 'golden window' for expanded global HIV/AIDS medicines access. However, this 'window' has also been critiqued as an unsustainable aberration to a continuing hegemonic regime that prioritizes patent protection, to the detriment of equitable global medicines access. This paper draws on both political economy analyses and discourse theoretical concepts to examine the processes of rupture and suture in HIV/AIDS medicines access discourse.
Political Science	Many efforts have been made to identify general patterns of interest intermediation in the EU, ranging from early studies about clientela relations to recent depictions of protest politics. This review covers studies that aim at cross-sectoral generalisations as well as analyses that are confined to specific sectors, policy areas, and issues. While many analyses are rooted in the debate on corporatism and pluralism, since the 1990s the conceptual range has extended to the study of policy networks and communities. More recent studies identify a simultaneous trend towards greater politicisation and institutionalisation of EU interest intermediation. Altogether, this literature has yielded inconclusive results. It is unclear whether the EU is marked by cross-sectoral patterns or whether it is more meaningful to focus on policy areas or sectors as units of observation. The discussion suggests that part of the controversy surrounding these findings stems from problems inherent in the typological logic that frames these analyses. It is also argued that the explanatory aspects of this literature need to be strengthened and linked more explicitly to studies examining the democratic stability and economic performance of the EU.
