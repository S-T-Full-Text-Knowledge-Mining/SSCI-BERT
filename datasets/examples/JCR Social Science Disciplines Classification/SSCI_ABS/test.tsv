History	"Rising from the ruins of a post-1918 Austria shed of its monarchical leadership and much of its former territory, the Salzburg Festival acquired a symbolic authority during the First Austrian Republic that continues to ensure its privileged place in Austrian politics and culture to this day. At the core of this privileged place are two signature legacies that, while grounded in the festival's prewar history, fortified a particular agenda of the Second Austrian Republic in defining Austrian history and national identity in the decades following World War II. The first, as expressed in 1919 by the festival's most articulate cofounder, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, is that with its Salzburg setting, the festival should be understood as situated in the heart of the heart of Europe, a place where the antitheses of Central European geography (German and Slavic, German and Italian), social class (commoner and elite), and aesthetic genre (dramatic theater and opera) encounter one another only to be dissolved through transcendence in an organic unity."
Development Studies	"This paper assesses two innovative development financing modelsspecialised global partnership funds (e.g. The Global Fund) and market-based approaches (e.g. GlobalGiving). Via a simple typology of development financing approaches these models are shown to contain distinctive and new elements. They have definite strengths, particularly in raising funds as well as unbundling fundraising from design and implementation. However, these models are not panaceas and replicate many weaknesses of traditional approaches to foreign aid. Donors should carefully consider the merits of supporting new financing structures relative to including innovative design features within existing aid programmes.

Family Studies	"This paper investigates gender differences in time on housework with relationship dissolution. Using longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (2001-2005) and a linear mixed modeling approach, we examine changes in housework hours before and after separation from marriage or cohabitation. The results indicate that relationship type affects change in housework hours of men and women following separation. Men's housework time increase with separation from marriage, but not from cohabitation. Women's housework time decrease after separation from both cohabitation and marriage. We also find evidence of anticipatory behavior where women who separate do less housework hours prior to separation than those who remain partnered. The paper concludes that gender equality is most likely in the absence of a co-residential partner."
Social Issues	"The proliferation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) since the 1970s has generated a wealth of research as to the causes and implications of the rise of this sector. Public awareness of NGOs and their activities has grown as well, at least in part due to increased media coverage of the organizations and the situations to which they respond. Although NGOs are not new to global polity, media attention to them as a sector only really began to take off in the 1990s. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis of two international newspapers from 1985-2010, this study explores the legitimation process of NGOs and examines the role of categorization and labeling in this process. The results show that the establishment of a distinct label in the media served to propel cognitive recognition of NGOs, and that media coverage reflects changes in cognitive legitimacy over time."
Law	"This article focuses on the legal geography of gated communities. Sociolegal research has paid comparatively little attention to how specific material forms fare within legal contexts. Drawing on work in legal geography and in science and technology studies, this article isolates judicial decisions that deal with the borders of gated communities from other cases involving private homeowner associations. By focusing on these boundary disputes in which outsiders are excluded from the area, this article finds that courts are resisting the localism presented by gated communities and are instead articulating a social imaginary in which the landscape flows uninterrupted by the exclusionary presence of gates. In contrast to the privatopia literature, this article finds that courts are not complicit in promoting neoliberal visions of community. The social imaginary being developed by courts resists the spatial differentiation of gated communities, producing in its place a thoroughly modern polity in which legal, economic, and political relations flow easily between those inside and outside the gate."
Management	"Recent highly publicized cases of scientific misconduct have raised concerns about its consequences for academic careers. Previous and anecdotal evidence suggests that these reach far beyond the fraudulent scientist and (his or) her career, affecting coauthors and institutions. Here we show that the negative effects of scientific misconduct spill over to uninvolved prior collaborators: compared to a control group, prior collaborators of misconducting scientists, who have no connection to the misconduct case, are cited 89% less often afterwards. We suggest that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is stigmatization by mere association. The result suggests that scientific misconduct generates large indirect costs in the form of mistrust towards a wider range of research findings than was previously assumed. The far-reaching fallout of misconduct implies that potential whistleblowers might be disinclined to make their concerns public in order to protect their own reputation and career."
Ethnic Studies	"In this article Blijdenstein introduces recent reflections on secular liberalism's treatment of religion and critically discusses those genealogical approaches that centre on uncovering the hidden theological roots of the liberal framework. The claim that contemporary liberal ideas on, for example, religion, secularity and tolerance are in fact 'Christian' or 'Protestant' comes with its own set of problems, as it hides from view the importance of the different political and historical contexts in which these categories have played, and continue to play, a role. Blijdenstein formulates three caveats on critiques that focus on the persistence of theological categories."
Urban Studies	"Candidates for municipal office collect millions of dollars to fund their campaigns. While previous research about local fundraising coalitions investigates the role of specific interest groups-for example, real estate professionals and developers-and donors outside the political jurisdiction, there has been little systematic investigation of individual donors classified by the size of their contribution or their geographic concentration within the city itself. In this article, we draw on administrative records of campaign contributions from the 2013 Seattle elections to answer two questions about the financing of municipal elections. First, drawing on research from federal elections, we ask whether candidates build fundraising coalitions comprised primarily of small-dollar donors or whether they rely heavily on high-dollar donors to fund their campaigns. In Seattle, we find that only one-fifth of donors in the mayoral election contributed at least $500, but their contributions account for 55% of the money raised in the election. Next, we ask how concentrated campaign contributors are within Seattle neighborhoods. Candidates collected nearly 25% of their funds from the wealthiest 10% of neighborhoods. By pointing to an outsized role for high-ollar donors and donors concentrated in affluent neighborhoods, this article identifies a critical dimension of representational distortion in municipal elections. In doing so, it opens a new window into the local campaign finance system-an aspect of our political process that has been largely overlooked in research on campaigns and elections."
Urban Studies	"Urban sustainability transitions have been increasingly imperative to address global environmental challenges, and local governments are expected to play a critical role. There is a pressing need to explore local governments"" underlying motivations and their impacts on governing practices. Taking China as an example, this paper builds an incentive matrix to distinguish the levels of local governments"" economic interest and environmental interest in specific low-carbon innovations and investigates how different incentive typologies affect their governing practices. By comparing four Chinese municipal governments"" incentives and governing practices in promoting solar water heater adoption, this paper finds that Chinese local governments"" environmental incentive is still not compelling or stable enough, while governments that are motivated by economic interests would resort to more substantial governance practices to promote the low-carbon innovations. These results indicate potential in latecomer cities in developing both economic and environmental incentives towards low-carbon innovations because green activities could also be favored if they are well aligned with local economic development."
Urban Studies	"This research is a descriptive assessment of the growth and stability of racially integrated neighborhoods in New York City from 1970 to 2010. The focus of our analysis is on the inclusion of blacks in these integrated areas given that current scholarship has shown that in other venues, Asians and Hispanics are socially separating themselves from blacks and aligning themselves with whites. The predominant pattern of racial integration in the city, and one that appears to have become more stable over time, combines whites, Asians and, to a lesser extent, Hispanics, but typically excludes blacks. We conclude by placing our findings within the broader literature on the emerging black/non-black color line, where Asians and Hispanics are increasingly aligned with whites while distancing themselves from blacks."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This study was examined the new money generated from Formula One Grand Prix (F1) and the economic impacts of this new money on the host economy using input-output analysis. We find that the impact of the new money from non-local attendees or international attendees is more pronounced compared to that from local attendees. Also, F1 event appears to influence on sports-related industry as well as other industries such as manufacturing industry. Our findings suggest that the host cities should focus on increasing the non-local and international attendees in order to enhance the economic impacts of a sport event."
Development Studies	"Large-scale mineral extraction is often accompanied by local conflicts, reflecting the fact that affected communities feel the costs of development but enjoy few of its benefits. Much of this conflict could be mitigated if communities could influence the design of projects and of management systems intended to minimise their impacts. This paper examines the potential role of community-controlled impact assessment, combined with negotiation of binding agreements between communities and developers, to allow affected communities to shape the impacts of extractive projects. It considers the wider political factors that must be addressed if these mechanisms are to be effective."
Ethics	"This article deals with a modern disease of academic science that consists of an enormous increase in the number of scientific publications without a corresponding advance of knowledge. Findings are sliced as thin as salami and submitted to different journals to produce more papers. If we consider academic papers as a kind of scientific 'currency' that is backed by gold bullion in the central bank of 'true' science, then we are witnessing an article-inflation phenomenon, a scientometric bubble that is most harmful for science and promotes an unethical and antiscientific culture among researchers. The main problem behind the scenes is that the impact factor is used as a proxy for quality. Therefore, not only for convenience, but also based on ethical principles of scientific research, we adhere to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment when it emphasizes ""the need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics in funding, appointment and promotion considerations; and the need to assess research on its own merits rather on the journal in which the research is published"". Our message is mainly addressed to the funding agencies and universities that award tenures or grants and manage research programmes, especially in developing countries. The message is also addressed to well-established scientists who have the power to change things when they participate in committees for grants and jobs."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of walking on incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men with and without chronic disease. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. PARTICIPANTS Japanese-American men aged 71 to 93 at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Physical activity was assessed according to self-reported distance walked per day. Depressive symptoms were measured using an 11-question version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 11) at the fourth examination (n=3,196) and at the seventh examination 8 years later (1999/00, n=1,417). Presence of incident depressive symptoms was defined as a CES-D 11 score of 9 or greater or taking antidepressants at Examination 7. Subjects with prevalent depressive symptoms at baseline were excluded. RESULTS Age-adjusted 8-year incident depressive symptoms were 13.6%, 7.6%, and 8.5% for low (< 0.25 miles/day), intermediate (0.25-1.5 miles/day), and high (> 1.5 miles/day) walking groups at baseline (P=0.008). Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, education, marital status, cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and functional impairment, showed that those in the intermediate and highest walking groups had significantly lower odds of developing 8-year incident depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR)=0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.83, P=.006 and OR=0.61, 95% CI= 0.39-0.97, P=.04, respectively). Analysis found that this association was significant only in participants without chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, Parkinson's disease, dementia, or cognitive impairment) at baseline. CONCLUSION Daily physical activity (>= 0.25 mile/day) is significantly associated with lower risk of 8-year incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men without chronic disease at baseline."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Objective: Previously an experimental computer system was developed to automatically-produce first drafts of genetic counseling patient letters containing biomedical evidence-based arguments. However, letters written by genetic counselors also employ strategies to help clients cope. The objectives of this research were to discover methods for addition of coping-related strategies to the drafts and to explore their efficacy. Methods: Using an argumentation-based approach, the system design was modified to add coping-related strategies used by actual genetic counselors. An evaluation of computer-produced drafts was performed comparing those containing only biomedical arguments to those with coping strategies added to biomedical arguments. Results: The evaluation mainly found no significant impact of adding coping strategies. Conclusion: The main contribution of this work was to show how coping-related strategies can be produced by an artificial intelligence approach within an argumentation-based theoretical framework. A possible future application would be to improve computer-drafted genetic counseling patient letters. Practice implications: Computer-assisted drafting of letters has potential to aid in the practice of genetic counseling. Further research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of adding coping strategies to computer-produced drafts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
International Relations	"Rising powers have attracted tremendous interest in international politics and theory. Yet the ways in which secondary powers strategically respond to regional changes in the distribution of power have been largely neglected. This article seeks to fill this gap by presenting a systematic comparative analysis of the different types and causes of contestation strategies undertaken by secondary powers. Empirically, it focuses on two contentious regional dyads in East and South Asia, exploring how structural, behavioral, and historical factors shape the way in which Japan and Pakistan respond, respectively, to China's and India's regional power politics. The article concludes that the explanatory power of these factors depends on the respective secondary power's particular context: in the case of Japan, China's increasingly assertive regional behavior combined with a nontransparent military buildup has invoked the most significant strategic shifts, while in the case of Pakistani contestation, an increasing threat perception in the late 1980s led to the return to a pre-1971 revisionist agenda, whereas the overt nuclearization in the late 1990s mitigated India's growing conventional superiority and enabled Islamabad to replace soft balancing with more direct means of hard balancing."
Geography	"In this paper I conceptualise relational ageing in spatial and comparative terms by comparing the life stories and practices of Latvian women who migrated with those who did not. By counterposing the literatures on global care and gender contracts, I make a plea for a time-space attentive geographical approach to ageing migrants, their pre-migration experiences and ongoing relations between migrants and non-migrants. First, I present some lesser-known dynamics of women-to-women (intra-gender) relations in these two groups. Second, I nuance relational effects in contexts when women are ageing but the man is absent from care responsibilities. And third, I focus on cross-generational relations narrated and practised by ageing women abroad and those who stayed in Latvia throughout their lives."
Ethics	"In ""Two-Level Eudaimonism and Second-Personal Reasons,"" Bradford Cokelet argues that we should reject one strategy one I advanced earlier in this journal for reconciling a virtue-ethical theoretical framework with that part of our moral experience that has been described as (among other things) second-personal reasons. Cokelet frames a number of related objections to that strategy, and his concerns are worth taking up. Addressing them provides an opportunity both to revisit and develop the model bruited in my earlier article and to gain additional insight into second-personal reasons and associated relations of accountability."
Substance Abuse	"Background and Objectives: This study investigated how negative social interactions (e.g., disagreeing with a friend) predicted subsequent drinking behaviors among Japanese college students. Because of social influences on drinking, and cultural norms for maintaining social harmony and making amends in response to social transgressions in Japanese culture, the authors hypothesized that students would consume more alcohol socially following increases in negative social interactions. Drinking refusal self-efficacy and social self-efficacy were also studied as moderators of social drinking. Methods: Fifty-five college students (79% women) of legal drinking age completed a once-daily Internet survey for 30days, providing 1195 daily reports of drinking and social interaction. Prior to the daily survey, participants reported on Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy and Social Self-Efficacy in an initial Internet-based assessment. Results: Students drank more socially in the evening following daytime increases in negative social interactions, relative to evenings following fewer such exchanges (b = .23, p < .001). At the between-person level, students who reported stronger confidence in refusing to drink drank less socially compared to those who reported less confidence in drinking refusal (b = -.53, p < .001). Yet, those with higher social self-efficacy, which is typically a health-protective factor, drank more socially compared to their counterparts (b = .32, p < .05). Conclusions and Importance: Japanese college students increased their social drinking in response to daily negative social interactions, consistent with the notion that this drinking pattern represents efforts to make amends to others. Interventions targeted toward increasing students' confidence in refusing to drink may be beneficial in reducing social drinking in this population."
Development Studies	"A key part of Howard White's work has been getting policymakers and other development decision-makers to use high-quality evidence to make better decisions. This paper reviews the role of evidence in decision-making and some of the key mechanisms by which this can be achieved. It recognises the many factors other than evidence that influence the decision-making process, and some of the barriers that have to be overcome for high-quality evidence to have a contributory role. The importance of identifying and using appropriate intermediaries is recognised, as is the necessity for clear and accessible communication."
Women'S Studies	"An important aspect of Johnson's intimate terrorism (IT) and situational couple violence (SCV) typology is his assertion that victims experience different negative outcomes depending on which category of violence they endure. Anderson calls for reexamining this typology to highlight the importance of coercive control with or without physical violence present. Similar to most studies, Anderson's research uses a sample that includes mostly White women. The current study employs Anderson's methods and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses, but uses a sample of predominately Black women and Latinas from the 1998 Chicago Women's Health Risk Study."
Transportation	"This paper studies clusters in the logistics sector. Like traditional cluster research, indicators of concentration to detect co-location of employment are calculated. However, this approach is enhanced by including a quantitative analysis of the inter-firm relations between logistics companies through the use of a community detection algorithm on a microeconomic dataset of buyer-supplier relations. Combining both results in a typology of logistics clusters. Next to the big clusters characterized by employment concentration and many internal and external relations, spill-over and polycentric clusters are identified. This approach seems promising to detect in future research clusters in other sectors and places."
Political Science	"The role of national parliaments in scrutinising their governments in European Union affairs has been at the forefront of debates on democratic accountability in the European Union for the past two decades. Resolutions are the legislative instruments most clearly associated with government control. This article finds that party political strategies, and especially the different constraints and incentives for mainstream/government parties and issue entrepreneurs on Europe, are the most important factors determining the activity of national parliaments in the form of resolutions on European Union affairs. Issue entrepreneurs are parties which are Eurosceptic and for which Europe is salient. Motions initiated by issue entrepreneurs are numerous but limited to criticising the government and contain little technical detail, while the resolutions of mainstream government parties mostly support the government's position. Resolutions and motions in European Union affairs are thus used rather as instruments of position taking' than as a form of government control, but could still help to foster accountability by bringing European Union issues and government policy to the citizens' attention."
"Education, Special"	"Two multiple-baseline, across-participants design studies were used to examine persuasive quick write (10-minute writing responses) performance of seventh-grade students with disabilities. In the first study, 6 students were taught by a graduate research assistant; in the second study, 10 students were taught by their special education teacher. In both studies, students' written responses were evaluated before, during, and after self-regulated strategy development instruction for the POW + TREE planning strategy (POW: pick my idea, organize my notes, write and say more; TREE: topic sentence, reasons-three or more, explain, ending). All study participants improved in the number of persuasive parts included and the quality of the written response immediately after and weeks following instruction."
International Relations	"The International Relations (IR) profession has not fully taken stock of the way in which user-driven information technologies including Blogger, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia-are reshaping our professional activities, our subject matter, and even the constitutive rules of the discipline itself. In this study, we reflect on the ways in which our own roles and identities as IR scholars have evolved since the advent of ""Web 2.0"": the second revolution in communications technology that redefined the relationship between producers and consumers of online information. We focus on two types of new media particularly relevant to the practice and the profession of IR: blogs and social networking sites."
Nursing	"In the current climate of global economic chaos and increasing healthcare litigation, it is perhaps simultaneously unsurprising and yet perplexing that patients continue to fall foul of healthcare systems worldwide. Major incidents in patient care such as serious misdiagnoses, medication errors, the proliferation of superbugs and malpractice persist leading to injury or death of patients, emotional trauma to their families and, understandably, a reduction in the public's confidence in the healthcare system not to mention the financial consequences. Many, if not most or indeed all, of these incidents are preventable and should not happen. Yet the systems in place within healthcare permit their occurrence, with worrying regularity, it would appear. The area that this paper will focus on specifically is that of medication errors. The worrying trends with regard to medication errors will be presented. Potential contributing factors will be examined. The specific aim of this paper is to illuminate the extent and severity of the problem of medication errors in practice and to explore elements within the practice setting that can compound the problem. The multi-faceted nature of the problem will also be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Gerontology	A model community-based outreach program overcomes barriers to screening and case identification of vulnerable older adults in psychiatric distress.
"Business, Finance"	"Using a unique international setting where the effects of disclosure on firm value can be measured in a constant regulatory environment and in isolation of other confounding factors, this paper shows that firms can increase their value through their choice of accounting standards. Specifically, we document strong positive abnormal returns at the announcement of voluntary adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS / IFRS) by a sample of international firms and an economically significant reduction in long-run returns, consistent with a reduction in the cost of capital. Consistent with these results we also document evidence of an upgrade in analyst recommendations after the IAS / IFRS adoption announcement and a reduction in the implied cost of capital. Finally, we find strong evidence that the documented abnormal returns are consistent with signaling and bonding benefits stemming from the reduction in asymmetric information. Our results highlight the importance of increased disclosure on minority shareholder protection and on corporate governance in general."
Substance Abuse	"Background: Drinking and smoking commonly co-occur in undergraduate students. Although an identity as a drinker is a known predictor of alcohol use and alcohol problems, and early evidence suggests that it also predicts smoking, the role of these behaviors in the development of an identity as a drinker is unknown. In this study, the authors conceptualized a drinker identity as an enduring memory structure referred to as a self-schema and conducted a preliminary investigation of the relationships between early drinking experiences, drinker self-schema, and alcohol and tobacco use in undergraduate students. Methods: Three-hundred thirty undergraduates who reported current alcohol and tobacco use were recruited for an online survey study. Frequency of alcohol and tobacco use in the past 30days, drinker self-schema, and early experiences with alcohol were measured. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that parental alcohol problems were associated with early onset of drinking. Early onset of drinking and high school friends' drinking were associated with more alcohol use and alcohol-related problems in high school. Alcohol problems during high school were associated with high drinker self-schema scores, which were associated with high frequency of alcohol and tobacco use during college. The indirect effects through the drinker self-schema were significant. Conclusions: Although cross-sectional, this preliminary examination supports theoretical predictions that early alcohol experiences may contribute to development of the drinker self-schema, which, as expected, was positively associated with alcohol and tobacco use in college. Longitudinal studies that track the unfolding of drinking behavior and the contextual factors that are associated with it in the development of the drinker self-schema are essential to confirming the theoretical model. If supported, implications for intervention at different developmental stages to prevent early onset of drinking, limit adolescent alcohol use, and modify the development of a drinker self-schema may mitigate undergraduate drinking and smoking."
Geography	"We know from the Grundrisse that Marx felt the division of town and country to be as vital to political economy as the division of classes. From the Manifesto we know that he saw this division as a homological version of the dependency created by capitalism of global South on global North. It was, however, the cultural theorists of twentieth-century Marxism who internalized this geopolitical imagination and significantly developed it in the form of scales and configurations of spatial meaning contained in the concepts city and country. The structuralist revolt against history, then, as a bid to arrest historical becoming, must really be seen as a perverse analogue of earlier twentieth century Marxist innovations in the spatialization of time. Thinkers like Ernst Bloch, Henri Lefebvre, and Raymond Williams, although unheralded for this aspect of their work, developed Marx's nascent city/country pairing, exploring the materiality of its metaphor. In geography, it is Neil Smith's Uneven Development that follows in the footsteps of this classical motif in literary and cultural theory."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: The present study aims at elucidating the impact of stroke on psychosocial functioning of stroke survivors. Methods: Data were investigated using interpretative thematic analysis of illness stories produced by 29 patients. Results: Eight themes emerged from the data: Medical Information; Interpersonal Changes; Cognitive, Physical and Emotional Functioning; Strategies of Coping; Social Support; and Information Irrelevant to the Question. The most frequent organization of the themes followed the course of medical intervention and rehabilitation. Narrations of individual patients varied in terms of the presence of particular themes, the amount of information on each topic and organization. Conclusions: The results suggest that the analysis of non-guided illness narratives can be effectively used to identify the thematic areas important to individual stroke patients. The thematic content analysis of stroke stories can allow health professionals to better understand the patient's state of knowledge related to illness as well as his or her socio-psychological functioning which may be useful in the course of planning further assessment and rehabilitation of patients with stroke."
Geography	"This paper explores conservation as an elite process in the Dominican Republic. It begins by showing how conservation at a global level is an elite process, driven by a small powerful elite. Looking at the Dominican Republic, it demonstrates how the extraordinary levels of protection have been achieved by a small network of well connected individuals, who have been able to shape conservation as they like, while limiting the involvement by the large international conservation NGOs who are considered so dominant throughout Latin America. Despite this, conservation both globally and in the Dominican Republic is shown to share similar political structures and the same lack of critique of capitalism or its environmental impacts."
Ethics	"Emotions are often portrayed as subjective judgments that pose a threat to rationality and morality, but there is a growing literature across many disciplines that emphasizes the centrality of emotion to moral reasoning. For engineers, however, being rational usually means sequestering emotions that might bias analyses-good reasoning is tied to quantitative data, math, and science. This paper brings a new pedagogical perspective that strengthens the case for incorporating emotions into engineering ethics. Building on the widely established success of active and collaborative learning environments, in particular the problem-based learning (PBL) philosophy and methodology, the paper articulates new strategies for incorporating emotion into engineering ethics education. An ethics education pilot study is analyzed to explore how PBL can engage students' emotions. Evidence suggests that PBL empowers students to cultivate value for engineering ethics and social responsibility, and in doing so, redefine the societal role of the engineer. Taking students' emotions seriously in engineering ethics offers an effective strategy to meaningfully engage students in ethical learning."
Women'S Studies	"This study estimates the lifetime prevalence of physical violence during pregnancy and examines risk and protective factors among women (N = 390) attending reproductive health clinics in Jordan. Approximately 15% reported physical violence during pregnancy. The husband was the sole perpetrator in 83% of the cases. A high frequency of quarreling, the husband's use of alcohol, attitudes supportive of a woman's duty to obey her husband, infrequent communication between the respondent and her family, and exposure to violence as a child increased the risk of violence. Consanguinity (marriage to a blood relative) and higher education levels were protective against violence during pregnancy."
Geography	"The current global migration regime is extremely complex and characterised by a polarisation of flows. Increasing numbers of individuals fleeing conflict regimes and seeking asylum are faced with restrictive immigration regimes whilst at the same time, highly skilled migrants are welcomed and encouraged to contribute to developed economies. This paper explores the asylum-migration nexus that has emerged as a result of restrictive immigration policy by drawing upon a survey of 300 health professionals in the UK. First, the empirical lens of health professionals fleeing conflict regions is employed to map the contours of the asylum-migration nexus. Second, the implications of highly selective asylum flows to Europe, in terms of economic and social characteristics, are considered. The paper concludes by highlighting concerns that Western refugee policy regimes are worryingly failing to fully meet moral obligations to protect individuals seeking asylum whilst also inadvertently supporting brain drain flows.

Rehabilitation	This review examines some of the critical factors that influenced the evolution of rehabilitation counselor education accreditation. The article discusses the history and structure of the accreditation process and the activities that have occurred to maintain the relevancy and viability of the process. Major issues that the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) has addressed in recent years are highlighted and examples are provided to illustrate the scope and importance of the accreditation process. Commentary is included to help the reader understand the issues that CORE will be addressing and the directions that may become priorities in the future.
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"This report traces the progressive expansion of health accounts (HA) to measure national health expenditures, from the first attempts in 1926 by the American Medical Association to the present day. Milestones in the development of A System of Health Accounts (SHA) are covered, from the economic background to initial efforts by a few countries and organizations, to the need for a set of accounting standards for health care systems, and finally, to consolidation with SHA 2011. International organizations, such as the World Health Organization, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Eurostat, the World Bank, and the United States Agency for International Development have been critical to expanding national HA exercises and ensuring that these are standardized, comparable, and become institutionalized. National efforts to track health expenditures have not only enriched collective results, but have become an important component of global leadership, informing policy the world over. More than 100 countries have created HA under the global standard and have gained a better understanding of health spending and financial flows. These results are key for monitoring progress toward national and global initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage. Challenges remain to be tackled, among them institutionalization and quality of results. Social responsibility for improving data sources and expanding the generation and usability of health accounts are also needed."
Education & Educational Research	"This article presents innovative analyses on the effects of the age composition of the class using the first wave of a large-scale longitudinal study of nine year old children, the Growing Up in Ireland study. The analyses focus on both academic and social outcomes. Taking account of a rich set of control factors, few overall differences were found in student outcomes between single-grade and multigrade classes. However, girls were found to experience a range of negative effects, depending on the age composition of the class. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Cochrane is an international network that produces and updates new knowledge through systematic reviews for the health sector. Knowledge is a shared resource, and can be viewed as a commons. As Cochrane has been in existence for 25 years, we used Elinor Ostrom's theory of the commons and Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to appraise the organisation. Our aim was to provide insight into one particular knowledge commons, and to reflect on how this analysis may help Cochrane and its funders improve their strategy and development. An assessment of Cochrane product showed extensive production of systematic reviews, although assuring consistent quality of these reviews is an enduring challenge; there is some restriction of access to the reviews, open access is not yet implemented; and, while permanence of the record is an emerging problem, it has not yet been widely discussed. The assessment of the process showed that the resource, community, and rules-in-use are complex, vary between different groups within Cochrane, and are not well understood. Many of the rules have been informal, and the underlying ethos of volunteerism where reviews get done are important features and constraints to the organisation. Like all collective efforts, Cochrane is subject to collective action problems, particularly free-riding and variable commitment, and the under-production of public goods and internal processes, such as surveillance of product quality and procedures for transparent resolution of conflicts."
Political Science	"When a public problem is perceived to be poorly addressed by current policy, it is often the case that credible alternative policies are proposed to both the status quo's left and right. Specially designed national surveys show that in circumstances like these, many Americans' preferences are not single-peaked on the standard left-right dimension. Rather, they simply want the government to ""do something"" about the problem and therefore prefer both liberal and conservative policies to the moderate status quo. This produces individual and collective preferences that are double-peaked with respect to the left-right dimension. Double-peakedness is less prevalent on issues where no consensus exists regarding policy goals, and it increases when exogenous events raise the public's concern about the seriousness of a policy problem."
Communication	"In this article we make an argument for why thinking critically about neoliberalism is important for media and communication studies. We advance a case for a critical media analysis that will take seriously the affective and psychic life of neoliberalism as an increasingly central means of governing and producing people""s desires, attachments, and modes of getting by. To illustrate our broader theoretical argument, we will discuss the contradictory neoliberal regulation of affective dispositions for women, which prescribe confidence or alternatively, the pleasing, lighthearted readiness to not take the self too seriously. We make a case for expanding our theoretical and conceptual vocabulary in order to foreground the relationship between neoliberalism, media and subjectivity in the maintenance of continuing inequalities."
Public Administration	"This paper discusses the presence of public policy as a subject of the public administration discipline in Brazil and the USA. The US experience is included due not only to the role the USA played in founding the discipline, but also to the influence it exerted on the establishment of the field of public policy studies in Brazil. Emphasis is given to turning points within public administration discipline, which resulted in the inclusion of public policy as its subject. It also discusses the impact of changes in the political regime on the Brazilian development of the field of public policy."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, the authors analyze changes in wage differentials between white men and women over time and across the entire wage distribution. The authors decompose distributional changes in the gender wage gap to assess the contribution of observed characteristics measuring individual productivity. They find that the gender wage gap narrowed by 16% at the lowest decile and by less than 5% at the highest decile. The decomposition results indicate that changes in the gender wage gap are mainly attributable to changes in educational attainment at the top of the wage distribution, with a sizable part due to work history changes at the bottom. The findings further reveal that the accuracy of the results depends on the direction in which the decompositions are performed."
Women'S Studies	This paper is a tentative attempt to set out some of the basic points for articulating an alternative philosophical praxis derived from some Black women's lives and experiences. It begins with an explanation of delegitimating processes and the importance of not dividing theory from practice. The essay offers six practices that outline the unique critical attitude that constitutes philosophical practices rooted in Black women's lived experience and asks How we sound when doing academic philosophy.
"Education, Special"	"Research into factors underlying the dissemination of evidence-based practice is limited within the field of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). This is pertinent, particularly in the UK where national policies and guidelines do not reflect the emerging ABA evidence base, or policies and practices elsewhere. Theories of evidence-based practice in education and policy suggest that decision makers' 'perceptions' of evidence are significant factors in dissemination. For professionals, scientific evidence is often critical. For others, including parents, experiential and anecdotal evidence can be as important. Within autism education, parents are often, and not necessarily by choice, key decision makers. This study is the first to try to identify and quantify UK parents' beliefs about ABA in the education and support of children with autism. We developed and tested, using an internet survey method, the Parental Beliefs about ABA and Autism scale (P-BAA). Current and/or past use by parents of any behaviorally based approach including ABA was a significant predictor of P-BAA scores as were parent education, household income and child diagnosis: experience of a behaviorally based approach, higher levels of education and income and children at the more 'severe' end of the autism spectrum were associated with more positive beliefs about ABA."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"In innovation policy discourse, clinical practice guidelines are often viewed as gatekeepers: they select which novel technologies may enter clinical practice. Earlier research has pointed out, however, that in biomedical innovation a 'regime of hope' and a 'regime of truth' interact. High expectations of future developments can feed into clinical guidelines by changing assessment criteria, thus co-shaping the 'gate' innovations have to pass. This paper shows how diagnostic guidelines can embody hope in yet another way, by introducing a novel disease vocabulary that paves the way for emerging diagnostic technologies. I discuss two sets of guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: the guidelines issued by the American National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (2011), and the parts of the DSM-5 related to diagnosing AD (2013). Both function as gatekeepers in that they explicitly discourage the use of biomarker testing in clinical practice. However, they also act as 'trailblazers', transforming the conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease in such a way that biomarker tests can be easily fitted in later on. The paper ends with some reflections on the potential presence of such 'trailblazing' in other diagnostic guidelines, and its acceptability from an ethical and societal point of view."
Environmental Studies	"Developing an approach to governing adaptation to climate change is severely hampered by the dictatorship of the present when the needs of future generations are inadequately represented in current policy making. We posit this problem as a function of the attributes of adaptation policy making, including deep uncertainty and nonstationarity, where past observations are not reliable predictors of future outcomes. Our research links organizational decision-making attributes with adaptation decision making and identifies cases in which adaptation actions cause spillovers, free riding, and distributional impacts. We develop a governing framework for adaptation that we believe will enable policy, planning, and major long-term development decisions to be made appropriately at all levels of government in the face of the deep uncertainty and nonstationarity caused by climate change. Our framework requires that approval of projects with an expected life span of 30 years or more in the built environment include minimum building standards that integrate forecasted climate change impacts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intermediate scenario. The intermediate IPCC scenario must be downscaled to include local or regional temperature, water availability, sea level rise, susceptibility to forest fires, and human habitation impacts to minimize climate-change risks to the built environment. The minimum standard is systematically updated every six years to facilitate learning by formal and informal organizations. As a minimum standard, the governance framework allows jurisdictions to take stronger actions to increase their climate resilience and thus maintain system flexibility."
Public Administration	"Social acceptance has become a key consideration for promoters, government officials and citizens when instituting new energy infrastructures and technologies. Often theorized in normative terms, it is not clear whether and when social acceptance matters. This article explores the rollout of smart meters in Quebec, which proceeded despite significant opposition from municipalities, community groups and unions. Drawing on core concepts from punctuated equilibrium theorypolicy monopoly, policy venue, policy imagewe argue that this opposition had no policy venue to express its grievances. Quebec's electricity sector, with a stable policy environment controlled by a policy monopoly and buttressed by a strong policy image, provided few opportunities to expand the conflict. We conclude from this analysis that public administrators should consider power when measuring social acceptance in political processes."
International Relations	"This article posits empirical and political reasons for recent micro-moves' in several contemporary debates, and seeks to further develop them in future International Relations studies. As evidenced by growing trends in studies of practices, emotions and the everyday, there is continuing broad dissatisfaction with grand or structural theory's value without going down' to lower levels' of analysis where structures are enacted and contested. We suggest that empirics of the last 15 years including the war on terror and the Arab Spring have pushed scholars into increasingly micropolitical positions and analytical frameworks. Drawing upon insights from Gilles Deleuze, William Connolly and Henri Lefebvre, among others, we argue that attention to three issues affect, space and time hold promise to further develop micropolitical perspectives on and in International Relations, particularly on issues of power, identity and change. The article offers empirical illustrations of the analytical purchase of these concepts via discussion of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring uprisings."
Rehabilitation	"Objective: To estimate the net monetary benefit of an individual placement and support-based supported employment program for Veterans with spinal cord injuries. Design: Economic evaluation comparing a supported employment program to treatment as usual, using cost and quality-of-life data from a longitudinal study of Veterans with spinal cord injuries. Setting: Spinal cord injury centers in the Veterans Health Administration. Participants: Subjects (N = 213) who participated in a 24-month supported employment program at seven spinal cord injury centers. Supported employment participants were compared with a group of spinal cord injury Veterans who received treatment as usual in a prior study. Main outcome measures: Costs and quality-adjusted life years using the Veterans Rand-6 Dimension, estimated from the Veterans Rand 36-Item Health Survey. Results: The supported employment program was more effective at both 1- and 2-year periods compared with treatment as usual. Outpatient costs were significantly higher for supported employment, but inpatient costs were not significantly different from treatment as usual. When cost and effectiveness were compared jointly using net monetary benefit, a supported employment program following the core principles of Individual Placement and Supported employment was more effective but not cost-effective at standard willingness to pay thresholds. When we considered a sub-group of the supported employment participants who more closely resemble the treatment as usual group from a randomized trial, there was no significant difference in the cost-effectiveness of supported employment when compared to treatment as usual. Conclusions: With higher effectiveness and similar costs, supported employment for spinal cord injury Veterans has the potential to be cost-effective. Future studies need to randomize participants or carefully match participants based on observable patient characteristics to improve cost-effectiveness evaluations of this population."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"The article takes a look at Brazilian Psychiatric Reform over the past decade, after the approval of Federal Law 10.216/2001 and seeks to elicit long overdue discussion about the pressing challenges that Brazilian Psychiatric Reform needs to tackle to promote or review the long-desired utopia of ""full citizenship for all in a society without asylums."" Is the Reform showing signs of exhaustion? The redirection of the care model for Mental Health in Brazil from the hospital to the community over the past decade is an undeniable achievement. Taking the use of psychoactive substances as the scope of policy and intervention, this incorporates complex demands that the current Crack drama makes it more urgent to question its history, its limits, its power. What will keep the flame alight of a successful movement that, surprisingly, has resisted the force of time and stigma in the ten years since the Law was enacted? These and other questions need to be worked on. It is time to recycle the focus of assessment and analysis in order to identify what threatens its vitality. This is the challenge to which the writer and debaters will be enjoined to contribute."
Information Science & Library Science	"Introduction. This study explores how personal information management practices could be used to help migrating individuals manage their cultural heritage legacies and to investigate how digital collections of libraries, archives, museums and other information institutions could be utilised by individuals to support further discovery of and learning about their cultural heritages. Method. This paper presents the results of a qualitative research study conducted on a purposive sample of 10 Croatian expatriates living in Europe and on expatriates from various countries living in Croatia. Participants were interviewed about their personal information management practices with a focus on immigration experiences and cultural information needs. Participants used an information source relevant for their personal collections or needs and described their experiences in semi-structured diaries. Results. Migration motivates people to assess the value of personal information and objects and to invest their effort in describing, safeguarding and sharing documents or items with significant value. A stronger motivation exists for using libraries, archives and museum collections when a need arises resulting from a knowledge gap about items in personal collections. Conclusions. Personal information management practices can make a significant difference in managing personal cultural heritage legacy. Collections of information institutions can constitute a part of those practices."
Communication	"A within-subjects experiment explored how the number of online, hyperlinked stories available for individuals to choose from affects cognitive processing of a selected story. Participants chose and read unpleasant online news stories from a Web page containing either 5 or 15 headline/photo hyperlinks. Heart rate data indicated more cognitive resources were allocated to reading stories selected from the larger array of hyperlinks. This increased allocation of cognitive resources also led to more accurate story recognition. Results of this study provide insight into information processing of interactive, online news as well as limited suggestions for the design of news Web sites."
Demography	"To what extent is there an association between crowding and relationship break-up? And if so, is it a causal relationship? Housing space may affect the probability of separation because of stress, lower subjective well being, and poor mental health, any of which could put pressure on the relationship with the partner and eventually cause a break-up. Using the Luxembourgish PSELL 2003-2011, we operationalize crowding with a subjective measure. We check for the following confounding factors: financial difficulties, home ownership, nationality, and type of household member. We find that there is no significant association between crowding and separation once confounders are taken into account, not to mention causality. Instead, home ownership turns out to be of the utmost importance in explaining the bivariate association between crowding and union dissolution."
Transportation	"Research has shown that there are potentially disastrous outcomes of human fatigue at sea. The conditions in which the seafarers have to operate are becoming more and more demanding. The study in this article attempts to aggregate accident charts derived from in-depth studies of human fatigue-related accidents to determine common patterns of interlinked fatigue factors. The accidents are analyzed by means of the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM), which in the article has been modified for maritime accidents. The main fatigue factors identified are 'shift work', 'irregular working hours', 'inadequate task allocation', and 'excessive demands'. The study reveals several differences between ship collision and grounding accidents and their corresponding fatigue factors. Human fatigue-related collision accidents are characterized by wrong/badly timed decisions, misconceptions, and poor communication between the vessels. Right before the collision the crew is often panicking and mistakes are easily made. In human fatigue-related groundings, the conditions are often monotonous and the navigating officer has either overlooked the upcoming seabed or simply fallen asleep. Safety climate issues are also identified as important contributors to human fatigue."

"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"This article discusses the poparms command, which implements two semiparametric estimators for multivalued treatment effects discussed in Cattaneo (2010, Journal of Econometrics 155: 138-154). The first is a properly reweighted inverse-probability weighted estimator, and the second is an efficient-influence-function estimator, which can be interpreted as having the double-robust property. Our implementation jointly estimates means and quantiles of the potential-outcome distributions, allowing for multiple, discrete treatment levels. These estimators are then used to estimate a variety of multivalued treatment effects. We discuss pre- and postestimation approaches that can be used in conjunction with our main implementation. We illustrate the program and provide a simulation study assessing the finite-sample performance of the inference procedures."
"Education, Special"	"The most efficacious psychosocial intervention for reducing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in young children is behavioral parent training (BPT). Potential benefits are hindered by limited accessibility, low session attendance, and poor implementation of prescribed strategies. As a result, only approximately half of families with young children with ADHD receive BPT. We describe an innovative approach for reducing barriers to BPT access. Specifically, we invoked an iterative, 5-step process of intervention development and revision to modify an existing face-to-face BPT program and develop an online version. Results indicated that the revised program and online versions (a) increased parent engagement with BPT, (b) enhanced accessibility, (c) produced favorable parent acceptability and feasibility ratings, and (d) resulted in improved child outcomes."
Transportation	"One of the most important road safety interventions is the elimination of accident black spots (places with accident density higher than expected). The first step of this process is the identification of these locations. There are several methods for this purpose, but most of them are now outdated. The primary objective of our 5-year project was to adopt data collection and analysis methods according to the related developments of the last decades: (1) the spreading of global positioning system (GPS) technology, (2) the appearance of tablets and smartphones, and (3) the existence of critical amounts of accidental data (enough for data mining approaches). This article presents the final results of our examinations. The authors prepared several methods, regulations, and computer software to integrate these advancements into the daily routine. From the year 2011, Hungarian police officers have used smartphones to record all data about accidents while on the scene, including the GPS coordinates, which leads to more accurate and reliable location information. This allowed the authors to develop a novel black spot-searching algorithm (inspired by some data mining techniques), based on the GPS coordinates of accidents. The authors have implemented it as a web service, and the practical experience shows that it performs very well, especially in built-up areas. Compared to the sliding window method, the site consistency is significantly higher, whereas the method consistency and the rank consistency are quite similar."
Nursing	"Purpose: The purpose of this mixed methods study was to better understand the long term impact of livingrelated liver donation (LRLD) on youth and young adult (YYA) recipients and their family. Design and methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with YYA, aged 11-18 years, who received a living donation from a parent. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed to aggregate themes that represented the participants"" views as live-liver recipients. An ethnographic process was conducted to understand the participants"" social behavior. At interview, participants completed a demographics questionnaire and the Youth Quality of Life Instrument-Research Version (YQOL-R). Results: Thirteen adolescents were interviewed; six were re-interviewed as key informants. Three major categories were created from the data: Developing Identity, Redefining Family Relationships, Feeling Gratitude to Donors. The overarching theme was Resiliency. Findings from the YQOL-R showed no difference in overall scores or separate domains when compared with a reference population with no chronic illness. Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative data highlight the positive effect that LRLD can have on pediatric patients as they transition from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood. Practice implications: As pediatric trans plant centers in the United States soon mark 30 years of performing live-liver donation, recipients are becoming adults and understanding more clearly that the long-term effects of such donations will lead to improvements in future care.

Economics	"This article employs a variety of econometric models (including OLS, VEC/VAR, DCC GARCH and a class of copula-based GARCH models) to estimate optimal hedge ratios for gasoline spot prices using gasoline exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gasoline futures contracts. We then compare their performance using four different measures from the perspective of both their hedging objectives and trading position using four different measures: variance reduction measure, utility-based measure and two tail-based measures (value at risk and expected shortfall). The impact of the 2008 financial market crisis on hedging performance is also investigated. Our findings indicate that, in terms of variance reduction, the static models (OLS and VEC/VAR) are found to be the best hedging strategies. However, more sophisticated time-varying hedging strategies could outperform the static hedging models when the other measures are used. In addition, ETF hedging is a more effective hedging strategy than futures hedging during the high-volatility (crisis) period, but this is not always the case during the normal time (post-crisis) period."
Education & Educational Research	"Multiple international studies have confirmed the positive impact of library services and teacher-librarian partnerships on delivering curriculum outcomes and quality student learning in secondary schools. Despite this, there are indications internationally that school libraries are in decline. This article uses qualitative data from a national survey of teachers and librarians in New Zealand secondary schools to investigate teacher and librarian attitudes and beliefs about the role of library services as a space to help develop The New Zealand Curriculum's (Ministry of Education, 2007) (NZC) future-focused vision of knowledgeable, critically and creatively engaged citizens, and the teaching of its attendant competencies. Our findings suggest that teachers' and librarians' beliefs and attitudes towards the library and to each other differ significantly, leading to an underutilisation of library services as a central resource for effective curriculum implementation. We conclude by arguing for a systemic revision of how libraries are positioned, staffed, and resourced in schools, that will change teacher and management beliefs to more closely align with the espoused pedagogical position of NZC and, ultimately, and most importantly, to engender sustained gains in student learning."
Development Studies	"Despite broad international agreement on the importance of addressing global health inequalities on grounds of both social justice and health security, there is little accord on how this should be done. The Debate that follows interrogates the role that capital and corporate institutions have assumed in defining and implementing global healthcare reforms. The contributors to the Debate do not agree on the legitimacy of the classic oppositions in design of healthcare state vs market or public vs private. Nor do they concur on the (in)compatibility between pragmatic collaboration with corporate institutions and realization of norms of social justice in health. Yet all do agree that unequal access to healthcare is only one of the structural determinants of inequalities in global health. Global capital is implicated in structural patterns of investment that have made jobs, wages and land-based livelihoods insecure and unhealthy, fouled air and water and profited from spiralling costs of drugs and treatment. On such an economically and politically conflictual terrain, it is unlikely that collaboration with corporate institutions is consistent with structural assault on the social determinants of global inequalities in health."
Political Science	"This article examines the relationship between religiosity and support for democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Using data from the last World Values Survey, we examine levels of religiosity among Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, and their support for democracy. The influence of religiosity on support for democracy is also explored. The results indicate that religiosity has a negative influence on support for democracy, and it is particularly true for individuals who do not support the separation of the religious from the political sphere and who exhibit lower support for democracy. The article also examines different levels of religiosity among the three groups, controlling for a wide range of variables. We conclude that there is basically no difference in support for democracy between Croats and Bosniaks, while Serbs exhibit somewhat lesser support for democracy than members of the other two ethnic groups. Serbs also seem to be somewhat less religious than Bosniaks and Croats. Opposition to separation of the religious from the political sphere is a major source of lack of support for democracy among Croats and Bosniaks, but not among Serbs."
Urban Studies	"Since the late 1990s, Chinese cities have been experiencing significant suburbanization with massive numbers of people moving out of city centers. Facing this background, this paper aims to identify the typology of residential resettlements in suburban areas, and analyze the mechanisms of each residential resettlement via archive studies, census tracks and field research instead of the traditional macro-demographic approach. Five types of resettlement are identified, comprising public housing districts for poor people with housing difficulties, low-end private housing districts for lower socio-economic people, multiple housing districts (containing public housing and low-end private housing) for displaced shantytown residents, and villa areas for the wealthy. This suburban residential resettlement pattern is generally different from that in Western cities, which is largely attributed to the Chinese governments' monopoly of land supply and public service provision. It is also concluded that the state power, capitalist actors (e.g., developers and private enterprises), and other professionals (e.g., planners and architects) have become the Chinese characterized 'pushing' factors and actors in driving the typology of suburban resettlement housing in the context of urbanization era of China. Besides, the five typology of resettlement housing has brought about socio-spatial consequences including a spatial mismatch for lower socioeconomic groups in suburban areas, which may lead to the formation of poverty belts around Chinese cities. This may provide important implication for understanding the residential resettlement in other developing countries with similar context."
Transportation	"This article proposes an integrated container management model to jointly optimize slot allocation plan for loaded containers and reposition for empty containers in a shipping network. The proposed model employs linear programming to formulate loaded and empty container shipping problems in a bi-level structure. In upper level the loaded container slot allocation plan aims to maximize operational profits for each service route; whereas in lower level the reposition of empty containers aims to minimize transportation costs for the entire shipping network. The surplus or deficient empty containers resulted from the upper problem are fed into the lower problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a real case of an intra-Asian short-sea container carrier is presented. The results show that the proposed model can serve as a decision support tool to facilitate the liner to ship the loaded and empty containers in a coordinative way."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This study investigated which intention-based model, namely: (1) the technology acceptance model (TAM; Model 1); (2) the theory of planned behavior (TPB: Model 2); and (3) the decomposed TPB (DTPB; Model 3) is best for predicting and explaining employees' behavioral intention to use hotel information system (HIS). Data were obtained from employees of 13 upscale hotels in jeju, South Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine and compare the three competing theoretical models (CTMs) in terms of overall model fit, explanatory power, and paths significance. The findings of this study revealed that if the key objective is to predict behavioral intention to use HIS, the TAM is preferable. However, if the key objective is to explain behavioral intention to use HIS, the DTPB is preferable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Gerontology	"Many couples want to retire together even if spouses differ in age. Drawing on theories of leisure complementarity, gender roles and social status, this article uses comprehensive Swedish register data from 2002 to 2010 to explore synchronised retirement and its association with spousal age differences and other socio-demographic factors. Synchronisation rates in dual-earner couples (N = 83,986) were 10 per cent for retirement the same calendar year and 25 per cent for retirement the same or the following year. Contrary to theoretical expectations, synchronisation was more common in women-older couples than in men-older couples, although this was largely a consequence of the skewed distribution of age differences. Moreover, spouses' education, incomes, assets, employment and health were differently associated with synchronisation in same-age, men-older and women-older couples. In the total population, average retirement age differed very little between synchronising couples and other couples. Yet women who synchronised retired at an earlier age than other women, whereas men who synchronised retired later than other men. This was partly an effect of the predominance of men-older couples, but men in men-older couples were also more likely than women in women-older couples to delay retirement in order to synchronise."
Information Science & Library Science	"A differential in the competitiveness of an organization is its ability to improve the use of knowledge, which sometimes is restricted to certain people or departments of organizations. The dissemination of knowledge and the need to learn continuously proving to be indispensable requirements in the current context, characterized by the increasing flow of information and skills required for the job. To disseminate information, learning and sharing process is essential. In that sense, the present study aims at verifying how such process occurs in a traditional food agribusiness established in Areia - PB. In methodological terms, the research is characterized as case study, of qualitative approach. The collection of data was accomplished by interviews with semi-structured survey based on Tonet and Paz (2006) sharing model and the results interpretation was based on a content analysis, besides the non participative observation, with the intention of capturing information, not revealed during the interviews. The results indicated that in the studied industry the main problems are in the initial phase of the sharing process, for there is not a formal and organized way to share experiences and information besides the lack of a favorable culture for knowledge sharing."
Area Studies	"The purpose of this article is threefold: to identify opportunities and constraints for migrants in participating in their host society; to further explore variance in formal political participation; and to assess how different citizenship policies give rise to different types of participation and different targets for claims-making. The article first discusses how different understandings of citizenship and implementations of citizenship policy give rise to a different set of opportunities for migrants to participate in the political sphere. This is exemplified with reference to Turkish organizations in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The paths these states have chosen in terms of integration and citizenship policies have resulted in a different set of opportunities for Turks' formal participation."
Transportation	"Port devolution and port governance are focal issues in port studies. This paper argues that the previous typology of port devolution and port governance, including port function matrix models, might have to be modified, in particular for Asian port cases, because they have not considered socio, economic, and political systems and historical aspects behind the port devolution continuum. This paper uses the ""compound eyes"" approach comprising of many similar, closely-packed facets called ommatidia, with a multiple angle view, to revisit and review previous port devolution and governance models. The paper aims to identify the limitations and rectify fallacies in previous port studies by conducting a critical review and taking a couple of Asian container port cases as examples. This paper contributes to the literature of port devolution and governance, illuminating crucial gaps that the previous studies have not addressed."
"Business, Finance"	"European companies were confronted with new organisational challenges when the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was introduced in 2005. What were their cognitive sources for developing ail orientation in this scheme? This paper presents original data from a survey of the University of Hamburg, dealing with companies' responses to the EU ETS in 2005-2007. The survey was conducted three times and addressed all companies covered by the trading scheme in Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands (response rate of 19%-23% over three years). Results are provided oil the share of companies that traded emission allowances, oil the knowledge of their own CO(2) abatement costs, oil the organisational unit that was responsible for decisions oil emissions trading, and oil the use of internal and external sources of advice. The data thus provides ail insight into the cognitive resources that companies brought to bear when looking for ail orientation in the new trading scheme. The sources of advice and the internal assignment of responsibility build the framework of competencies in which companies learn to account for carbon. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Economics	"We examine the relationship between proficiency in Mandarin and consumption in China. We find that proficiency in Mandarin has a positive effect on an individual's total consumption expenditure as well as most categories of consumption expenditure. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the effects of Mandarin proficiency on consumption across subsamples. In addition, we find that proficiency in Mandarin has a positive effect on relative consumption, irrespective of the manner in which the reference group is defined. Our results have important policy implications for debates on the promotion of a national language and, in particular, recent debate about the promotion of speaking Mandarin in China.

"Education, Special"	"The present study investigated the reasons of parents request for the initial evaluation to determine their children's special educational needs (SEN) and the state authorities' response in the Greek educational system. For the needs of the present study, 250 case files were randomly selected from a state Centre for Differential Diagnosis and Support, which is responsible for the identification, evaluation and intervention for students with SEN. Various data were recorded, such as parental reason for requesting the evaluation, the official designation for each case, whether the parent accepted the evaluation results and whether any individualised intervention plan or other recommendations were specified. The analysis suggested that most cases involved students with learning disabilities, although a certain degree of disagreement in the classification of students was observed. For the majority of cases, parents accepted the official diagnosis; however, the state centre did not offer an intervention plan to benefit the students in the majority of the cases. Implications based on the present study findings are considered."
Law	"Deregulation has played both the hero and the villain in recent years. This Article evaluates the impact of deregulation on what may be the single most economically important regulatory regime: the income tax. In order to accomplish this goal, it applies the concepts of fiscal arbitrage and compliance spirals to three deregulatory tax reforms. Compliance spirals describe an enforcement dynamic in which the regulator encourages compliance through a system of rewards for cooperation and punishment for noncooperation. Fiscal arbitrage describes policy measures that exploit cognitive biases and other anomalies to deliver political benefits by using minimal political capital. The combination of these two concepts creates a tool for tax authorities to evaluate deregulatory tax provisions for likely costs and benefits. On balance, this Article finds that tax deregulation is likely to be harmful."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"In a representative sample of 13,683 U.S. employees, we compared survivors of layoffs, offshoring, outsourcing, and their combinations to a group who experienced no downsizing. Survivors of layoffs perceived lower organizational performance, job security, affective attachment, calculative attachment, and had higher turnover intentions. Offshoring survivors perceived lower performance, fairness, and affective attachment, but outsourcing survivors generally did not have more negative outcomes than the no-downsizing group. Layoffs generally had more negative outcomes than other downsizing forms."
Ethics	"One of the most interesting features of the computer is its ability to create virtual environments. These environments allow us to interact with objects that are simulated by the computer and are not real. They thus allow us to realize actions that have no repercussions whatsoever on the non-virtual world. This seems to qualify virtual environments as an ideal playground to do all kinds of things that would be labelled ethically wrong if realized in the real world. Nevertheless, we have the feeling that certain types of virtual actions raping computer simulated girls for example are not right at all, in spite of the fact that we know that no actual person is harmed by this. In the light of phenomena like virtual rape and violence, philosophical reflection on the ethical status of actions realized in virtual worlds has become inevitable. This paper will provide the groundwork for such a reflection, by answering the following questions: Can we apply the predicates of 'right' and 'wrong' to actions realized in virtual worlds? And if this turns out to be problematic, how can we explain our feeling of discomfort with certain types of virtual behaviour, i.e. our feeling that there is something 'not at all right' about, for example, virtual rape? These questions will be answered in the three sections of this paper. The first section deals with the necessary condition for the application of the predicates of 'right' and 'wrong' to virtual actions: freedom in the virtual environment. In the second section, we will endeavour to demonstrate that the fulfilment of this necessary condition is not sufficient when it comes to the application of these predicates to virtual actions. The last section explains how we can still be uncomfortable with certain virtual actions, even though the said actions escape ethical judgment."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"The Crescent Ranking (CR) is a service benefiting both the supply-side (halal-friendly hotels) and the demand-side (Muslims wanting to have a guest experience consistent with their way of living) within the tourism market. Halal is a technical term in the Arabic language usually translated as permissible from the perspective of Islamic law (sharia'ah). This study examines the transparency of the top and bottom 10 hotels listed on the CR site. First, we compared the hotel profile as per the CR listing with the hotel's own website. Next, we examined guest reviews on a word-of-mouth proxy site (), paying particular attention to the feedback of non-Muslim guests. Following this analysis, self-styled Islamic hotel managers were interviewed to triangulate the data. We found Islamic hotels to be intransparent to their guests seeking an Islamically compliant holiday and also to those seeking a conventional hotel experience. We suggest several reasons hotels misrepresent themselvesself-orientalization, a necessity to present nice Islam, an ethics gap, and/or a poor understanding of marketing and market positioning. We consider regulation of the Islamic hotel industry to be a mechanism policy makers, and managers could, adopt to become transparent and to protect demand-side (guests) rights. Regulation would also differentiate hotels operating an Islamic business model and those merely offering a few simple services appreciated by Muslim travellers."
Political Science	"The state of American federalism in 2014-2015 is characterized by inertia and centrifugal force. Party polarization and divided government exacerbate gridlock at the federal level as President Obama faces Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Policy activity has shifted outward to state legislatures and citizens, the federal and state executive branches, and the court system, creating a diverse set of alternative institutional pathways and outcomes. Some policies, like Medicaid and K-12 education, are largely shaped by federal-state executive branch negotiations, leading to individualized state programs. Other policies-such as marijuana, gun, and immigration laws-are made by state legislatures or citizens acting through the initiative process. Meanwhile, a series of court decisions has doubled the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal. In the current political context, American federalism is characterized by a substantial dispersion of power and a variety of pathways to policy-making."
Social Work	"This article addresses the questions of why to include and how to approach LGBT issues in the context of European social work education. Referring to social work's commitment to LGBT people, the article points out its ongoing relevance as questions of marginalisation and discrimination point far beyond formal equality in legislation and normalisation of homosexuality within existing societal institutions. Furthermore, new questions and dynamics in rapidly changing and highly diverse societal contexts bring about new challenges in addressing LGBT issues. Against this background, the article discusses problems of representation and knowledge and underlines the potential of a queer approach. A queer perspective questions taken-for-granted assumptions about sexual orientation, gender identity and intimate relationships. It challenges normalising categories of sex, gender and desire and brings out possibilities existing beyond the heteronormative order. This way, it offers social work education a powerful theoretical lens to address issues on sexual orientation and gender identity not only as yet another minority issue, but as transversal matter and as good news for all. In this article, we use the acronym LGBT to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. LGBT is meant to include and at the same time emphasise the differences between people who do not (exclusively) define themselves as heterosexual and who cannot or do not want to match or identify with binarities of sex, gender and desire. We do not use the acronym LGBTI because we find it problematic to include intersex people without taking explicitly into account their specific situations and needs. Making a plea for a queer approach, we share - of course - a critical view on categorisations and identity labels."
Social Work	"This study examined the predictive effects of attitude toward aging on mental health of aging Chinese. Data were obtained from community surveys utilizing mixed sampling methods of 4,240 elderly Chinese 55 years or older in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used, with sociodemographic variables entered first, followed by the health variables, and then attitude toward aging. The effect of attitude toward aging on mental health was stronger than most other predictive factors. Social workers should focus on creating social/community environments that build a positive attitude toward aging."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"The prospect of lab-grown meat has attracted a lot of attention. The peak of this attention occurred after the public tasting of the first 'lab-grown burger' in August 2013. However, the discourse surrounding lab-grown meat is limited, and largely shaped by the technology's proponents. This limited narrative restricts the potential for public discussions and debates about the details of lab-grown meat's development. Such restrictions clash with lab-grown meat proponents' stated goal of openness and complicate some of their ethical claims. To begin to overcome these restrictions, this paper introduces contamination as a method that brings important excluded elements to bear on narratives of technological development, particularly those that emphasize biological immanence and plasticity. Reading proponent's narrative alongside related discourses - the industrialization of agriculture, the biomedical history of cell culture, and the work of bioartists and science fiction writers - reveals systematically excluded contaminants that could threaten the technology's viability. The nature of these contaminants is both material (e.g., microorganisms, fetal bovine serum) and semiotic (e.g., associations with factory farming and fictional dystopias), revealing the usefulness of contamination as a tactic that both encourages paying attention to the ways in which discourse and matter coshape each other and broadens the scope of consideration and discussion around technological development."
Nursing	"Purpose: The present study aimed to highlight the feeding challenges of infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) that caregivers encounter and analyze the alternative interventions they perform based on their experiences in the preoperative period. Design and methods: Parents of 200 infants with CLP were asked to complete our questionnaire. The prenatal feeding preparations, preoperative processes, and feeding challenges and modifications to overcome these difficulties were evaluated. Results: One-third of the caregivers stated that they had received feeding education prenatally. Sixty-five percent of the parents stated that they were not successful in breastfeeding. Infants with isolated cleft lip had minor feeding difficulties, whereas the ones with cleft palate had some major challenges such as aspiration, choking, and inadequate growth. Parents also reported that 59.5% of the infants with cleft had stayed in the intensive care units following birth. Moreover, 42% of the infants were initially fed by nasogastric or orogastric tube. Out of the 166 infants with cleft palate, 31.9% used palatal obturators. Conclusions: We have reviewed the various feeding difficulties of the infants with clefts and highlighted the results of the interventions performed to overcome these difficulties for better nutrition and growth.

I briefly review plug-in and cross-validation bandwidth selectors, both of which are implemented in kcdf. I then describe the command syntax and illustrate its use with an application to artificial data."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article examines how a particular class of material objects-antidepressants-circulate in women's social, cultural and intimate lifeworlds. Following the action of antidepressants in their encounters with bodies and brains by way of the agencies they express and the specific work they perform reveals much of the social, affective and material gendering of depression, along with the everyday activities by which this gendering is resisted. Drawing on data from a qualitative research project, we examine how women conceptualise their brains as needing 'work' through antidepressants, and then consider the particular kinds of 'work' that these objects perform. In instances where they refuse antidepressant medication, women co-constitute antidepressants as objects to be resisted and objects that resist, reframing in the process relationships between corporeality, diagnosis and pharmaceutical matter. The 'female' brain emerges in our study as a potent site for the gendering of depression as antidepressants become entangled in the social, material and affective dynamics of women's everyday lives."
History Of Social Sciences	"The Ayalon route is an infrastructural corridor serving as the principal northern and southern entrance to the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, bundling together multi-lane expressway, railway tracks, and a flood regulation canal. Its planning history, changing from a meandering seasonal river to Israel busiest traffic route, was a lengthy and incremental process, generating several plans by different planning agencies with different ambitions. Since the inception of the idea to implement a highway on what was described as 'natural opening' - the beds of the Ayalon (Musrara) river, this area became a landscape of opportunity, inciting social imagination among urban planners, municipal and national officials who used the road as an organizing device for the development of the city and the nation. This historical research explores the co-production of urban planning and transportation planning, not as rivalling forces but as coproducing processes."
Linguistics	"Why do nominalizations mean what they do? I investigate two deverbal nominalizers in Northern Paiute (Uto-Aztecan, Numic: Western United States), -na and -di, which create nominalizations that describe either an event (like the Poss-ing gerund in English) or an individual (like agent nominalizations with -er). I propose a syntax and semantics for these deverbal nominalizations that account for their interpretive variability. On the syntax side, I argue that -na and -di overtly realize the nominal functional head that canonically assigns case to possessors when this head takes a vP complement. On the semantics side, I propose that Northern Paiute has operators that abstract over a variable inside nominalizations. This accounts for the meanings that deverbal nominalizations in Northern Paiute have, and it highlights their relationship to nominalization patterns in other languages.*"
International Relations	"This article suggests that there exists an alternative form of international political behavior between countries who share a common traumatic past: diplomacy with memory. Diplomacy with memory manifests itself as an official, diplomatic team performance that aims at conveying a certain historic image for the purpose of achieving rational aims on the international stage. In a first step, a theoretical and empirical framework is developed that highlights diplomacy with memory as a strategic diplomatic action that does not conform with mainstream IR models of state behavior. In a second step, the new theoretical model is tested on two selected post-conflict scenarios: The bilateral negotiations between West Germany and Israel, and between Austria and Israel about eventual reparation payments to the Jewish state in the early 1950s. Extracting the core elements of the diplomacy with memory from these historical examples, this paper suggests amending the toolkit of traditional diplomatic strategies with memory in order to better explain state behavior in other postconflict situations as they emerge."
Family Studies	"This article reports findings from an interpretive study of filial responsibility constructions among 28 adult children with ageing parents in Victoria, Canada. Participants were interviewed in person and data were analysed using coding and constant comparison, with attention to the content and process of talk. Participants tended to have difficulty with using the construct of responsibility to describe the support they provided for ageing parents. Ambivalence was tied to symbolic associations of the construct with obligation and burden, which were difficult to reconcile with interpretations of filial relationships as loving and moral, and participants' desires to construct themselves as autonomous. Participants also sought to interpret parent support as voluntary, yet the ideal of choice was difficult to reconcile with specific realities. The discussion highlights how the interpretive framework of choice may further inadvertently support political and economic goals that promote and increase the need for family care of older people."
Economics	"Economic instability has risen in emerging economies after capital account liberalization. A more progressive income tax policy could offer a stabilizing alternative. It could result in more revenue, more countercyclical policy, and more income equality and thus more stable demand growth. We test the effects of progressive taxes on stability using univariate and multivariate analyses based on panel data for emerging economies from 1982 to 2002 and compare those to the effects of a value added tax (VAT). We also consider possible constraints on tax policy design, such as government spending, international tax competition, and openness. Progressive taxes are associated with greater income equality and a higher likelihood of countercyclical fiscal policies. The potential benefits from progressive income taxation, though, are lower with VAT. Tax policy is also constrained by government expenditures and openness, but not by lower corporate taxes, suggesting that all income tax rates are constrained by openness."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Minimum wages legislation in the United Kingdom applies to those aged 16years or older. Evidence is presented that children believe that their wage levels should be fair'. On one hand, such views have emerged from focus groups of working children. On the other, various pressure groups representing young people are seeking to establish fair payment to child workers. It is argued that the government, trade unions and other bodies have failed to adequately address the protection of young workers."
Communication	"Four editing variables were tracked through a content analysis of U.S. commercial network editing that spanned a 36-year period. The analysis revealed that synthetic-montage increased and continuity-realism decreased from 1969 through 1997. Network news editors also embraced faster pacing, shorter soundbites, and more special effects between 1969 and 2005. When taken together, the results suggest that U.S. network television journalism has evolved from more ocamera of recordo and realistic news techniques in favor of a variety of synthetic editing strategies that convey complex audio-visual arguments."
Urban Studies	"This article characterizes and evaluates a paradigm case of urban collaborative governance: the so-called Nantes model. Stressing its positioning in the particular tradition of French politics and drawing on poststructuralist discourse theory, this article demonstrates how the myth of the jeu a la Nantaise (the Nantes game) informs a discourse of urban collaborative governance with a distinctive triad of policy goals. In the context of fiscal tightening and multiple crises, this governance practice involves various strategies designed to incorporate neighborhoods and communities in the co-production of public policies in a pragmatic way. Analyzing the grammar and forms of these practices reveals that co-governance in Nantes functions as a doctrinal abridgement, leading to a growing managerialization in an increasingly codified system of community participation. We thus conclude that one line of flight in the Nantes model signifies a movement away from an image of collaborative pragmatism as a complex praxis of governing to an ideology that conceals the complications and messiness of governing in a collaborative manner."
Information Science & Library Science	"In many important application domains, such as text categorization, scene classification, biomolecular analysis and medical diagnosis, examples are naturally associated with more than one class label, giving rise to multi-label classification problems. This fact has led, in recent years, to a substantial amount of research in multi-label classification. In order to evaluate and compare multi-label classifiers, researchers have adapted evaluation measures from the single-label paradigm, like Precision and Recall; and also have developed many different measures specifically for the multi-label paradigm, like Hamming Loss and Subset Accuracy. However, these evaluation measures have been used arbitrarily in multi-label classification experiments, without an objective analysis of correlation or bias. This can lead to misleading conclusions, as the experimental results may appear to favor a specific behavior depending on the subset of measures chosen. Also, as different papers in the area currently employ distinct subsets of measures, it is difficult to compare results across papers. In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of multi label evaluation measures, and we give concrete suggestions for researchers to make an informed decision when choosing evaluation measures for multi-label classification."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES To assess the associations of long-term lifestyle multidomain intervention (MI) and omega-3 supplementation with frailty level evolution and frailty incidence in community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial. SETTING Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1588 community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or older with memory complaints (without dementia), slow gait speed, or limitation in one instrumental activity of daily living. INTERVENTION A 3-year MI (43 group sessions including cognitive training, physical activity, and nutrition advice and three preventive consultations) plus daily omega-3 fatty acids, MI plus placebo, omega-3 alone, or placebo alone. MEASUREMENTS The frailty phenotype (unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait, low handgrip strength: 0 to 5 score, higher is worse; a score of 3 or higher defines frailty) was assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. We used mixed-effect models for frailty level (0-5 score as an ordinal variable) and Cox models for frailty incidence. RESULTS No differences were found between the intervention groups and placebo on the 3-year evolution of frailty level. Among 1394 non-frail participants at baseline, frailty incidence occurred in 134 (9.6%) persons: 26 (7.6%) in the MI plus omega-3 group, 34 (10%) in the omega-3 alone group, 31 (8.5%) in the MI plus placebo group, and 43 (12.3%) in the placebo-alone group). No differences regarding frailty incidence were found between intervention groups and placebo. After exclusion of 53 participants with incident frailty during the first year of follow-up, MI plus omega-3 was associated with a lower frailty incidence compared with placebo (hazard ratio = .43; 95% confidence interval = .22-.81). CONCLUSION In community-dwelling older persons, the combination of a long-term lifestyle MI and omega-3 supplementation did not reduce frailty level or incidence. The reduction of frailty incidence associated with the combined intervention in a sensitivity analysis needs to be further confirmed. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1700-1706, 2019"
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"With the market competition of hotel industry being heated, it is critical that hotels have a breadth of resource and more flexible forms to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. In the past, the relation of total quality management (FQM), market orientation, and performance are equivocal. These mixed results may be due to some factors or not to include the environmental factors. This study adopts the Input-Processing-Output (IPO) concept model to construct all variables research model. The research surveyed samples of 588 and used Structural Equation Model and discriminate analysis for analysis and testing. The results show that TQM positively affects hotel performance. Market orientation positively affects hotel performance. Market orientation has the mediating effect between TQM and hotel performance. External environment factors truly play a moderator between TQM, market orientation and hotel performance, especially when external environment factors greater changes are going to help to build relationship with customer, to enhance hotel performance and further to gain chance of hotel's survival.

Development Studies	"This paper examines the interactive effect of financial development and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows on domestic investment in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). A panel data of 16 SSA countries sampled from 1980 to 2014 are employed. Using the fixed effect, pooled OLS and the FMOLS techniques, our empirical results show that financial development complements FDI inflows to augment domestic investment in SSA. Among other things, the direct effect of FDI inflows, financial sector development, real GDP growth, domestic savings and trade openness are investment promoting while lending rate and inflation inhibit domestic investment in the region. As a policy implication, deepening the financial sector demands considerable attention since it serves as an important channel through which FDI influences domestic investment. While developing the financial sector, it is equally essential that policymakers give enough attention to key macroeconomic stability."
International Relations	"We examine whether refugee flows increase transnational terrorism in states to which refugees flee. Recent studies find that refugee flows contribute to the spread of interstate and civil war, but to a far lesser extent have studies examined how refugee flows could lead to other forms of political violence. We discuss two ways in which refugee flows can lead to transnational terrorism: how conditions in camps contribute to the radicalization of refugees; and how poorly host states treat refugees. We then conduct empirical tests using data on worldwide international refugee flows and transnational terrorism. Specifically, we model the effect of refugee flows on transnational terror attacks within a directed dyad framework to account for characteristics of origin and host states. Using a rare-events logit model, along with count models to check robustness, we find that refugee flows significantly increase the likelihood and counts of transnational terrorist attacks that occur in the host country, even when controlling for other variables. Given the prominence of refugee flows and populations worldwide, the results suggest that states with significant refugee populations and the international community at large should take measures to address the conditions in refugee camps, as well as the treatment of refugees by host states in order to prevent transnational terrorism."
"Business, Finance"	"We calculate composite indices to compare the attractiveness of 27 European countries for institutional investments into the Venture Capital and Private Equity asset class. To achieve this we use 42 different parameters, and propose an aggregation structure that allows for benchmarking on more granulated levels. The United Kingdom leads our ranking, followed by Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. While Germany is slightly above the average European attractiveness level, the scores are rather disappointing for France, Italy, Spain, and Greece. Our analyses reveal that while the UK is similar to the other European countries with respect to many criteria, there are two major differences, which ultimately affect its attractiveness: its investor protection and corporate governance rules, and the size and liquidity of its capital market. The state of the capital market is likewise a proxy for the professionalism of the financial community, for deal flow and exit opportunities. We determine a reasonable correlation between our attractiveness index scores and actual Venture Capital and Private Equity fundraising activities and prove the robustness of our calculations. Our findings across all the European countries suggest that, while investor protection and capital markets are in fact very important determinants for attractiveness, there are numerous other criteria to consider.

Public Administration	"There is some tendency to lump together policy failures arising from different sources and having different fundamental characteristics. This is a problem conceptually, as well as for building effective theory about policy failure, but it can also be a practical difficulty for policymakers if they fail to differentiate these various possible roots of failure. This paper explores the linkages among these types of failure within the public sector."
