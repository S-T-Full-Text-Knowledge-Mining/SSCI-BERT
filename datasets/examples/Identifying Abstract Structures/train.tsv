B	Humanistic care in medicine has shown to improve healthcare outcomes.
B	Language barriers are a significant obstacle to humanistic care , and trained medical interpreters have demonstrated to effectively bridge the gap for the vulnerable limited English proficiency ( LEP ) patient population.
B	One way in which medical schools can train more humanistic physicians and provide language access is through the implementation of programs to train bilingual medical students as medical interpreters.
B	The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate whether such training had an impact on bilingual medical student's interpretation skills and humanistic traits.
M	Between 2015 and 2017 , whole-day ( similar to 8 h ) workshops on medical interpretation were offered periodically to 80 bilingual medical students at the Penn State College of Medicine.
M	Students completed a series of questionnaires before and after the training that assessed the program's effectiveness and its overall impact on interpretation skills and humanistic traits.
M	Students also had the opportunity to become certified medical interpreters.
R	The 80 student participants were first-to third-year medical students representing 21 languages.
R	Following training , most students felt more confident interpreting ( 98% ) and more empathetic towards LEP patients ( 87.5% ).
R	Students' scores in the multiple-choice questions about medical interpretation/role of the interpreter were also significantly improved ( Chi-Square test , p < 0.05 ).
R	All students who decided to take the exam were able to successfully become certified interpreters.
R	Ninety-two percent of participants reported they would recommend the program and would be willing to serve as a future "coaches" for interpreter training workshops delivered to peer students.
C	Our program was successful in increasing self-reported measures of empathy and humanism in medical students.
C	Our data suggests that implementation of medical interpreter training programs can be a successful strategy to develop of humanism in medical students , and aid in the development of sustainable language access for LEP patients.
B	Lack of agreement about criteria and terminology for children's language problems affects access to services as well as hindering research and practice.
B	We report the second phase of a study using an online Delphi method to address these issues.
B	In the first phase , we focused on criteria for language disorder.
B	Here we consider terminology.
M	The Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements is rated by a panel of experts , who then have the opportunity to view anonymised ratings from other panel members.
M	On this basis they can either revise their views or make a case for their position.
M	The statements are then revised based on panel feedback , and again rated by and commented on by the panel.
M	In this study , feedback from a second round was used to prepare a final set of statements in narrative form.
M	The panel included 57 individuals representing a range of professions and nationalities.
R	We achieved at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two rounds of ratings.
R	These were collapsed into 12 statements for the final consensus reported here.
R	The term 'Language Disorder' is recommended to refer to a profile of difficulties that causes functional impairment in everyday life and is associated with poor prognosis.
R	The term , 'Developmental Language Disorder' ( DLD ) was endorsed for use when the language disorder was not associated with a known biomedical aetiology.
R	It was also agreed that ( a ) presence of risk factors ( neurobiological or environmental ) does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD , ( b ) DLD can co-occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders ( e.g. ADHD ) and ( c ) DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal ability.
C	This Delphi exercise highlights reasons for disagreements about terminology for language disorders and proposes standard definitions and nomenclature.
P	The autosegmental-metrical ( AM ) framework represents an established methodology for intonational analysis in unimpaired speaker populations but has found little application in describing intonation in motor speech disorders ( MSDs ).
P	This study compared the intonation patterns of unimpaired participants ( CON ) and those with Parkinson's disease ( PD ) , ataxic dysarthria ( AT ) , and foreign accent syndrome ( FAS ) to evaluate the approach's potential for distinguishing types of MSDs from each other and from unimpaired speech.
M	Spontaneous speech from 8 PD , 8 AT , 4 FAS , and 10 CON speakers were analyzed in relation to inventory and prevalence of pitch patterns , accentuation , and phrasing.
M	Acoustic-phonetic baseline measures ( maximum-phonation-duration , speech rate , and F0-variability ) were also performed.
R	The analyses yielded differences between MSD and CON groups and between the clinical groups in regard to prevalence , accentuation , and phrasing.
R	AT and FAS speakers used more rising and high pitch accents than PD and CON speakers.
R	The AT group used the highest number of pitch accents per phrase , and all 3 MSD groups produced significantly shorter phrases than the CON group.
C	The study succeeded in differentiating MSDs on the basis of intonational performances by using the AM approach , thus , demonstrating its potential for charting intonational profiles in clinical populations.
B	Clinical depression is highly prevalent yet under-detected and under-treated in palliative care settings and is associated with a number of adverse medical and psychological outcomes for patients and their family members.
B	This article presents a study protocol to evaluate a training intervention for non-physician palliative care staff to improve the recognition of depression and provide support for depressed patients and their family members.
B	Details of the hypotheses and expected outcomes , study design , training program development and evaluation measures are described.
B	Methods and
M	A randomised controlled trial will be implemented across two palliative care services to evaluate the "Training program for professional carers to recognise and manage depression in palliative care settings".
M	Pre- , post- and three-month follow-up data will be collected to assess: the impact of the training on the knowledge , attitudes , self-efficacy and perceived barriers of palliative care staff when working with depression ; referral rates for depression ; and changes to staff practices.
M	Quantitative and qualitative methods , in the form of self-report questionnaires and interviews with staff and family members , will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.
C	This study will determine the effectiveness of an intervention that aims to respond to the urgent need for innovative programs to target depression in the palliative care setting.
C	The expected outcome of this study is the validation of an evidence-based training program to improve staff recognition and appropriate referrals for depression , as well as improve psychosocial support for depressed patients and their family members.
B	Premature termination is a common problem in the treatment of personality disorder.
B	Efforts to improve compliance should begin by recognising risk factors for premature termination.
B	This prospective study identified predictors of premature termination from a day treatment program for personality disorder.
M	Consecutively admitted patients with a personality disorder ( n = 197 ) were assessed with self-report and interview measures.
M	Patient personality characteristics were the primary predictors.
M	Others were demographic , initial disturbance , and personality disorder variables.
M	Cox proportional hazards regression was used.
R	Risk of terminating prematurely significantly increased if the patient had been previously hospitalised for psychiatric difficulties , was younger , had fewer prior contacts with health and social services , and had more severe borderline personality disorder traits.
C	Information about which patients are at high risk for premature termination can help clinicians take measures to modify the risk.
C	This might involve selection decisions , pre-treatment preparation , close monitoring during treatment , or addition of adjunctive interventions.

P	To analyze whether previously identified risk factors for sudden death syndrome have a significant impact in a developing country.
M	Retrospective longitudinal case-control study carried out in Porto Alegre , Southern Brazil.
M	Cases ( N=39 ) were infants born between 1996 and 2000 who died suddenly and unexpectedly at home during sleep and were diagnosed with sudden death syndrome.
M	Controls ( N=117 ) were infants matched by age and sex who died in hospitals due to other conditions.
M	Data were collected from postmortem examination records and questionnaires answers.
M	A conditional logistic model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome.
R	Mean age at death of cases was 3.2 months.
R	The frequencies of infants regarding gestational age , breastfeeding and regular medical visits were similar in both groups.
R	Sleeping position for most cases and controls was the lateral one.
R	Supine sleeping position was found for few infants in both groups.
R	Maternal variables , age below 20 years ( OR=2 , 95% CI:1.1 ; 5.1 ) and smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy ( OR=3 , 95% CI: 1.3 ; 6.4 ) , significantly increased the risk for the syndrome.
R	Socioeconomic characteristics were similar in both groups and did not affect risk.
C	Infant-maternal and socioeconomic profiles of cases in a developing country closely resembled the profile described in the literature , and risk factors were similar as well.
C	However , individual characteristics were identified as risks in the population studied , such as smoking during pregnancy and maternal age below 20 years.
P	The study was conducted to develop and test a hypothetical model which explains self-care behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes was established based on the Self-Determination Theory.
M	The participants were 218 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in an outpatient clinic of one endocrine center in Korea.
M	The data were collected using questionnaires from April 5 through May 7 , 2010.
M	The descriptive and correlation statistics were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 15.0 and the structural equation modeling procedure was performed using the AMOS 7.0 program.
R	The results of this study showed that competence and autonomous motivation were the strong factors influencing self-care behavior in patients in this sample.
R	Support from health provider for autonomy was a significant indirect factor on self-care behavior.
R	These factors explained 64.9% of variance in the participants' self care behavior.
R	The proposed model was concise and extensive in predicting self-care behavior of the participants.
C	Findings may provide useful assistance in developing effective nursing interventions for maintaining and promoting self-care behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes.
B	Much of the research on the detrimental effects of inequality on well-being is based on cross-sectional surveys , which may have over- or under-estimated the relationship between income inequality and well-being.
B	Moreover , the vast majority of the work comes from Western industrialized contexts but it is not known to what extent the same pattern holds in non-Western developing countries.
P	The current research aims to address these two issues by investigating the longitudinal effects of income inequality on well-being in China.
M	We used the China Family Panel Studies dataset in 2010-2014.
M	Our study includes a representative sample of 29 ,331 residents from 20 provinces in China.
M	The participants completed measures of well-being , including subjective well-being and psychological distress.
M	We examined whether provincial-level income inequality in 2010 predicted individual-level well-being in 2014.
R	Multilevel analyses showed that residents in more unequal provinces had lower subjective well-being and greater psychological distress.
R	The patterns still held , after controlling for baseline well-being and a number of covariates , including age , gender , education , income , ethnicity , marital status , and urban/rural residence.
R	The effects of inequality on well-being differed across socioeconomic groups.
C	Findings suggest that income inequality has long-term adverse consequences on well-being in a non Western developing society.
C	Furthermore , its effects are moderated by financial wealth.
B	To meet the treatment needs of the growing number of adolescents who seek help for cannabis use problems , new or supplementary types of treatment are needed.
B	We investigated whether multidimensional family therapy ( MDFT ) was more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in treatment-seeking adolescents with a DSM-IV cannabis use disorder in The Netherlands.
M	One hundred and nine adolescents participated in a randomized controlled trial , with study assessments at baseline and at 3 , 6 ,9 and 12 months following baseline.
M	They were randomly assigned to receive either outpatient MDFT or CBT , both with a planned treatment duration of 5-6 months.
M	Main outcome measures were cannabis use , delinquent behavior , treatment response and recovery at one-year follow-up , and treatment intensity and retention.
R	MDFT was not found to be superior to CBT on any of the outcome measures.
R	Adolescents in both treatments did show significant and clinically meaningful reductions in cannabis use and delinquency from baseline to one-year follow-up , with treatment effects in the moderate range.
R	A substantial percentage of adolescents in both groups met the criteria for treatment response at month 12.
R	Treatment intensity and retention was significantly higher in MDFT than in CBT.
R	Post hoc subgroup analyses suggested that high problem severity subgroups at baseline may benefit more from MDFT than from CBT.
C	The current study indicates that MDFF and CBT are equally effective in reducing cannabis use and delinquent behavior in adolescents with a cannabis use disorder in The Netherlands.

B	Unlike other disorders , much of the economic burden of mental disorders is not due to direct costs of care , but due to indirect costs such as loss of employment and the receipt of public assistance.
P	The goal of this paper is to estimate how having a mental disorder impacts employment outcomes , receipt of public assistance and food assistance.
M	We estimate the impact of having a mental disorder on employment and the receipt of public assistance using instrumental variable ( IV ) methods and a longitudinal dataset: National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.
M	Having a mental disorder is instrumented by whether the individual has any close family members with a history of alcohol , drug or behavioral disorders.
M	We use bivariate probit models that control for individual socio-demographic characteristics and health status variables.
R	Results show that having any mental disorders is associated with a significant reduction in the probability of being employed by 0.09 ( or 9 percentage points ) , and in the probability of being employed full-time by 0.10.
R	For public assistance outcomes , having any mental disorders is associated with a significant increase in the probability of receiving public assistance and food assistance by 0 ,10 and 0.15 , respectively.
R	These estimated marginal effects using instrumental variable methods are greater than the standard probit model estimates for all outcomes , implying that the true impact of having a mental disorder is underestimated by standard models that do not employ an identifying strategy that controls for endogeneity.
C	The relatively large marginal effects on employment and public assistance suggest that effective diagnosis and treatment of individuals with mental disorders in the workforce can have a significant impact on productivity and public assistance programs.
B	Seeking screening and treatment for chlamydia ( CT ) and gonorrhea ( GC ) by young women is critical to reduction of asymptomatic cervicitis and its complications.
P	To evaluate the efficacy of a client-centered motivational behavioral intervention ( MBI ) , to promote seeking of sexually tranmitted infection ( STI ) checkups by young women.
M	Three hundred seventy-six of 770 eligible sexually active , nonpregnant , English-speaking women ( mean age 18.5 years ) were recruited from an urban reproductive health clinic and randomized to two groups: intervention plus standard care ( MBI ) or standard care alone ( SC ).
M	MBI ( two sessions plus booster ) was based on the Transtheoretical Model of Change and employed motivational interviewing.
M	Outcome measures monitored for 12 months included: client-initiated clinic visits for STI checkups in response to seven high-risk sexual behaviors by self-report ( primary ) , consistent condom use , number of CT and GC episodes , and movement along the stages of change obtained at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments ( secondary ).
M	Analyses included chi-square , logistic regression , and generalized estimating equations.
R	At baseline , more than 70% endorsed the action stage of change for seeking STI checkups for three of seven high-risk sexual behaviors.
R	No significant differences were noted between the two groups for the primary or secondary outcomes.
R	Across groups , having multiple partners and being pregnant or thinking one might be pregnant were associated with STI checkups.
C	This is the first known client-centered clinical trial to promote STI screening.
C	Risk-taking and health-seeking behaviors are complex and interrelated with STI and pregnancy concerns.
C	The intervention may have an effect if it is targeted to women in a less medically connected community-based sample.

B	Stroke-related muscle wasting is one of the factors leading to long-term disability and functional dependency.
B	No study has reported an effective therapeutic intervention for such muscle wasting.
P	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) on quadriceps muscle mass preservation in patients with acute moderate or severe stroke by using ultrasonography ( US ).
M	Twenty patients with acute , moderate , or severe stroke ( age: 68 +/- 11 years ) were divided into usual care group ( control group ) and intervention groups ( NMES group ) , respectively.
M	Patients in theNMESgroup underwent NMES treatment for bilateral quadriceps muscles for 2 weeks in addition to the usual care.
M	Quadriceps muscle thickness was measured on admission and 2 weeks after the first measurement.
R	The quadriceps muscle thickness on the paretic and non-paretic sides in the NMES group ( -12.4% +/- 12.7% , -5.5% +/- 15.3% , respectively ) significantly decreased to a lesser degree than that in the control group ( -29.5% +/- 12.1% , P = 0.004 ; and -22.0% +/- 16.8% , P = 0.04 , respectively ).
C	NEMS seemed to have preserved the quadriceps muscle mass in patients with moderate or severe acute stroke.
B	Cigarette smoking habit usually begins in adolescence.
B	The developing countries in South Asia like Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and Nepal , where the largest segment of the population is comprised of adolescents , are more susceptible to smoking epidemic and its consequences.
B	Therefore , it is important to identify the association between anti-smoking initiatives and current smoking status in order to design effective interventions to curtail the smoking epidemic in this region.
M	This is a secondary analysis of national data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey ( GYTS ) conducted in Pakistan ( year 2003 ) , India ( year 2006 ) , Bangladesh ( year 2007 ) , and Nepal ( year 2007 ).
M	GYTS is a school-based survey of students targeting adolescents of age 13-15 years.
M	We examined the association of different ways of delivering anti-smoking messages with students' current smoking status.
R	A total of 19 ,643 schoolchildren were included in this study.
R	The prevalence of current smoking was 5.4% with male predominance.
R	No exposure to school teachings , family discussions regarding smoking hazards , and anti-smoking media messages was significantly associated with current smoking among male students.
R	Participants who were deprived of family discussion regarding smoking hazards ( girls: odds ratio ( OR ) 1.56 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.84-2.89 , p value 0.152 ; boys: OR 1.37 , 95% CI 1.04-1.80 , p value 0.025 ) , those who had not seen media messages ( girls: OR 2.89 , 95% CI 1.58-5.28 , p value < 0.001 ; boys: OR 1.32 , 95% CI 0.91-1.88 , p value 0.134 ) , and those who were not taught the harmful effects of smoking at school ( girls: OR 2.00 , 95% CI 0.95-4.21 , p value 0.066 ; boys: OR 1.89 , 95% CI 1.44-2.48 , p value < 0.001 ) had higher odds of being current smokers after multivariate adjustment.
C	School-going adolescents in South Asia ( Pakistan , India , Nepal , and Bangladesh ) who were not exposed to anti-tobacco media messages or were not taught about the harmful effects in school or at home had higher odds of being current smokers than their counterparts.
B	The creation of biobanks depends upon people's willingness to donate their samples for research purposes and to agree to sample storage.
B	Moreover , biobanks are a public good that requires active participation by all interested stakeholders at every stage of development.
B	Therefore , knowing public's attitudes towards participation in a biobank and biobank management is important and deserves investigation.
M	A survey was conducted among family members of patients attending the outpatient department of our institute for a geriatric or neurological visit , documenting their willingness to participate in a biobank and their views on the legal-ethical aspects of biobank management.
M	Information regarding subjects' attitudes on biomedical research in general and genetic research in particular was also collected.
M	Participants' data on biobanks were compared with data previously collected from the Italian ethics committees ( ECs ) to evaluate the extent to which lay people and ethics committees share views and concerns regarding biobanks.
R	One hundred forty-five subjects took part in the survey.
R	The willingness to give biological samples for the constitution of a biobank set up for research purposes was declared by 86% of subjects and was modulated by subjects' education.
R	People in favour of providing biological samples for a biobank expressed a more positive view on biomedical research than did people who were not in favour ; attitude towards genetic research in dementia was the strongest predictor of participation.
R	Different from ECs that prefer specific consent ( 52% ) and do not choose the option of broad consent ( 8% ) for samples collection in a biobank , participants show a clear preference for broad consent ( 57% ) , followed by partially restricted consent ( 16% ) , specific consent ( 15% ) , and multi-layered consent ( 12% ).
R	Almost all of the subjects available to contribute to a biobank desire to receive both individual research results and research results of general value , while around fifty per cent of ECs require results communication.
C	Family members showed willingness to participate in a biobank for research and expressed a view on the ethical aspects of a biobank management that differ on several issues from the Italian ECs' opinion.
C	Laypersons' views should be taken into account in developing biobank regulations.
P	Past research has established parameters for the 2f1-f2 distortion product otoacoustic emissions ( DPOAEs ) that enhance response levels (  e. g. , L1-L2 = 10 dB ; f2/f1 = 1.22 ; L1 , L2 = 65 , 55 dB SPL ).
P	These same parameters do not optimize 2f2-f1 DPOAEs.
P	Therefore , this study was conducted to evaluate more completely those parameters that produce the most robust 2f2-f1 output.
M	Input-output functions of the 2f2-f1 component were obtained from 20 normal-hearing adults (  with f2 = 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz ).
M	Frequency ratios , level differences , and overall sound levels were manipulated with parameter combinations chosen to expand on information established in previous studies.
M	The DPOAE signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , response presence , and output levels were measured.
R	In general , mean SNRs and 2f2-f1 levels were greater , and DPOAEs were present more often for 2000 than for 4000 Hz across all parameter combinations.
R	No single parameter combination resulted in pronounced maxima for 2f2-f1 , which is consistent with past studies but is in sharp contrast to results for the more familiar 2f1-f2.
C	Overall , the results suggest that to maximize the 2f2-f1 level , lower test frequencies , low frequency ratio , essentially equal levels of primary tones , and moderate stimulus levels are best , and such parameters might be important for applying DPOAE measurement to assessment of normal and impaired auditory function.
B	Research indicates that exposure to war-related traumatic events impacts on the mental health of refugees and leads to higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , and anxiety symptoms.
B	Furthermore , stress associated with the migration process has also been shown to impact negatively on refugees' mental health , but the extent of these experiences is highly debatable as the relationships between traumatic events , migration , and mental health outcomes are complex and poorly understood.
P	This study aimed to examine the influence of trauma-related and post-migratory factors on symptoms of PTSD , depression , and anxiety in two samples of Bosnian refugees that have resettled in two different host nations-Austria and Australia.
M	Using multiple recruitment methods , 138 participants were recruited to complete self-report measures assessing acculturative stress , PTSD , depressive , and anxiety symptoms.
R	Hierarchical regressions indicated that after controlling for age , sex , and exposure to traumatic events , acculturative stress associated with post-migratory experiences predicted severity of PTSD and anxiety symptoms , while depressive symptoms were only predicted by exposure to traumatic events.
R	This model , however , was only significant for Bosnian refugees resettled in Austria , as PTSD , depressive , and anxiety symptoms were only predicted by traumatic exposure in the Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia.
C	These findings point toward the importance of assessing both psychological and social stressors when assessing mental health of refugees.
C	Furthermore , these results draw attention to the influence of the host societyon post-migratory adaptation and mental health of refugees.
C	Further research is needed to replicate these findings among other refugee samples in other host nations.
B	Medicaid Buy-Ins are optional programs states may implement to create work incentives for people with disabilities.
B	These programs allow participants to increase earnings without losing Medicaid eligibility potentially moving them out of poverty without risking loss of health care coverage.
B	They also provide the opportunity for beneficiaries to offset some of their medical costs to the federal and state governments through premiums for coverage and increased taxes paid.
B	State and federal policy makers and administrators have speculated about who might enroll , how they might use the benefits , and whether positive health outcomes for persons with disabilities would result.
P	We compared characteristics and health care utilization of 184 enrollees and 158 eligible nonenrollees in Kansas' Medicaid Buy-In.
R	Enrollees were older and significantly more likely to have more than one disability , with mental illness being more prevalent than physical disabilities , and to have both higher Social Security and earned income.
R	A majority of the sample was dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid with Medicaid paying most costs.
R	Home health service costs were the primary difference between enrollee and nonenrollee expenditures.
C	Increased Medicaid Buy-In enrollment could prevent long-term dependence on federal disability benefits.

B	Engaging community partners in research has the potential to make findings higher quality , more actionable , and more meaningful.
B	Less rigorous approaches , often used by community-engaged partnerships , may diminish data quality.
P	This study highlights the key guiding principles of a community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach , particularly in regards to improving rigor , for a door-to-door health survey conducted by promotoras in a low-income , Latino neighborhood in San Jose , California.
M	We describe the partnership formed to conduct the study and the participatory process used throughout the study in questionnaire and sample design , training , and survey administration that adheres to key CBPR principles.
M	Lessons Learned: Our participatory approach required building the capacity of partners , having all partners weigh in on issues that arose in the field , enlisting outside expertise , being responsive to partner concerns while adhering to validated survey methods , simplifying sample design , incorporating expectations for data quality into training , and dedicating sufficient staffing to survey administration.
C	The procedures , materials , and tools used by the community-engaged partnership in this study can be replicated by other community partnerships seeking to improve the quality of data used for decision making , program planning , and resource allocation.
B	Newborn mortality , comprising a third of all under-5 deaths , has hardly changed in low and middle income countries ( LMICs ) including South Africa over the past decade.
B	To attain the MDG 4 target , greater emphasis must be placed on wide-scale implementation of proven , cost-effective interventions.
B	This paper reviews economic evidence on effective neonatal health interventions in LMICs from 2000-2013 ; documents lessons for South African policy on neonatal health ; and identifies gaps and areas for future research.
M	A narrative review was performed in leading public health databases for full economic evaluations conducted between 2000 and 2013.
M	Data extraction from the articles included in the review was guided by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards ( CHEERS ) checklist , and the quality of the included economic evaluations was assessed using the Quality of Health Economics Studies Instrument ( QHES ).
R	Twenty-seven economic evaluations were identified , from South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa , with those from sub-Saharan Africa primarily focused on HIV/AIDS.
R	Packages of care to prevent neonatal mortality were more cost-effective than vertical interventions.
R	A wide variability in methodological approaches challenges the comparability of study results between countries.
R	In South Africa , there is limited cost-effectiveness evidence for the interventions proposed by the National Perinatal Morbidity and Mortality Committee.
C	Neonatal strategies have a strong health system focus but this review suggests that strengthening community care could be an additional component for averting neonatal deaths.
C	While some evidence exists , having a more complete understanding of how to most effectively deploy scarce resources for neonatal health in South Africa in the post-2015 era is essential.
P	This paper examines gender as a moderating variable between having an anxiety disorder diagnosis and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery ( CABG ) outcomes in rural patients.
M	Using the 2008 Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) database , 17 ,885 discharge records of patients who underwent a primary CABG surgery were identified.
M	Independent variables included age , gender , race , median household income based on patient's ZIP code , primary expected payer , the Deyo , Cherkin , and Ciol Comorbidity Index , and an anxiety comorbidity diagnosis.
M	Outcome variables included in-hospital length of stay and patient disposition ( routine and nonroutine discharge ).
M	A 2 x 2 analysis of variance and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the interaction between gender and an anxiety disorder diagnosis on in-hospital length of stay and patient disposition.
R	Twenty-seven percent of rural patients undergoing a CABG operation had a comorbid anxiety diagnosis.
R	Rural patients who had nonroutine discharge were more likely to have comorbid anxiety diagnosis compared to rural patients who had a routine discharge.
R	There was a significant interaction effect between having an anxiety diagnosis and gender on length of hospital stay but not for patient disposition.
C	Three findings were noteworthy.
C	First , anxiety disorder is prevalent in rural patients who are undergoing a CABG operation.
C	Second , anxiety was a significant independent predictor of both length of hospital stay and nonroutine discharge for patients receiving CABG surgery.
C	Last , having an anxiety disorder diagnosis increased hospital stay for both males and females ; however , females seemed to be impacted more than males.
B	Risk factors for hip fracture are well studied because of the negative impact on patients and the community , with mortality in the first year being almost 30% in the elderly.
B	Age , gender and fall risk-increasing drugs , identified by the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden , are well known risk factors for hip fracture , but how multimorbidity level affects the risk of hip fracture during use of fall risk-increasing drugs is to our knowledge not as well studied.
B	This study explored the relationship between use of fall risk-increasing drugs in combination with multimorbidity level and risk of hip fracture in an elderly population.
M	Data were from Ostergotland County , Sweden , and comprised the total population in the county aged 75 years and older during 2006.
M	The odds ratio ( OR ) for hip fracture during use of fall risk-increasing drugs was calculated by multivariate logistic regression , adjusted for age , gender and individual multimorbidity level.
M	Multimorbidity level was estimated with the Johns Hopkins ACG Case-Mix System and grouped into six Resource Utilization Bands ( RUBs 0-5 ).
R	2.07% of the study population ( N = 38 ,407 ) had a hip fracture during 2007.
R	Patients using opioids ( OR 1.56 , 95% CI 1.34-1.82 ) , dopaminergic agents ( OR 1.78 , 95% CI 1.24-2.55 ) , anxiolytics ( OR 1.31 , 95% CI 1.11-1.54 ) , antidepressants ( OR 1.66 , 95% CI 1.42-1.95 ) or hypnotics/sedatives ( OR 1.31 , 95% CI 1.13-1.52 ) had increased ORs for hip fracture after adjustment for age , gender and multimorbidity level.
R	Vasodilators used in cardiac diseases , antihypertensive agents , diuretics , beta-blocking agents , calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were not associated with an increased OR for hip fracture after adjustment for age , gender and multimorbidity level.
C	Use of fall risk-increasing drugs such as opioids , dopaminergic agents , anxiolytics , antidepressants and hypnotics/sedatives increases the risk of hip fracture after adjustment for age , gender and multimorbidity level.
C	Fall risk-increasing drugs , high age , female gender and multimorbidity level , can be used to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from a medication review to reduce the risk of hip fracture.
P	This study was designed to examine the early usage patterns of multiple grammatical functions of DO in children with and without specific language impairment ( SLI ).
P	Children's use of this plurifunctional form is informative for evaluation of theoretical accounts of the deficit in SLI.
M	Spontaneous uses of multiple functions of DO were analyzed in language samples from 89 children: 37 children with SLI , ages 5 ; 0-5 ;6 ( years ; months ) ; 37 age-equivalent children ; and 15 language-equivalent children , ages 2 ; 8-4 ;10.
M	Proportion correct and types of errors produced were analyzed for each function of DO.
R	Children with SLI had significantly lower levels of proportion correct auxiliary DO use compared to both control groups , with omissions of the DO form as the primary error type.
R	Children with SLI had near-ceiling performance on lexical DO and elliptical DO , similar to both control groups.
C	Plurifunctionality is not problematic: Children acquire each function of DO separately.
C	Grammatical properties of the function , rather than surface properties of the form , dictate whether children with SLI will have difficulty using the word.
C	Overall , these results support the extended optional infinitive account of SLI and the use of auxiliary DO omissions as part of a clinical marker for SLI.
P	The purpose of this study was to determine whether proactive criminal thinking , reactive criminal thinking , or both are responsible for crime continuity by way of psychological inertia.
P	It was hypothesized that reactive but not proactive criminal thinking would account for psychological inertia , the process by which certain cognitive variables link past crime to future crime.
M	Self-report data from 673 ( 322 male , 351 female ) mid- to late adolescent members of the Offending , Crime , and Justice Survey ( OCJS ) were organized into four waves of a fixed-sample panel design.
R	A path analysis revealed that while reactive criminal thinking successfully mediated the prior offending future offending relationship , proactive criminal thinking did not.
R	As predicted , the reason why proactive criminal thinking failed to mediate crime continuity was that prior offending did not correlate significantly with subsequent proactive criminal thinking.
C	These results suggest that reactive but not proactive criminal thinking is a vital link in the series of cognitive events that give rise to crime continuity.
C	The reason for this is that while reactive criminal thinking was both predicted by and predictive of offending , proactive criminal was only predictive of offending and therefore not a good candidate for psychological inertia.

B	To systematically review evidence of the effects of the duration of untreated depression on the clinical outcomes of patients suffering from Unipolar Major Depression.
M	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence of duration of untreated depression and the effect it has on clinical outcomes in Unipolar Major Depression.
M	Data used to this purpose were obtained from a literature search of the MEDLINE.
M	Psychoinfo and Embase databases.
M	Comparable data extracted from studies were entered and analysed using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software Version 5.2.
R	Ten studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria.
R	Only three studies reported comparable data and were consequently used for the meta-analysis.
R	Pooled data indicates the overall positive effect of shorter duration of untreated illness both in a patient's response to treatment ( RR 1.70 ) and remission ( RR 1.65 ).
R	Other studies which were not included in the meta-analysis confirmed the importance of reducing delays in the treatment of depression in order to prevent the risk of worse outcomes and chronicity , in particular in patients presenting with a first episode of depression.
R	Data regarding the association between the duration of untreated episode in recurrent depression and clinical outcomes are less evident.
C	The heterogeneity of the selected studies was cause for limitations with regard to the carrying out of adequate meta-analysis.
C	There is evidence highlighting the importance of a reduced no-treatment interval for patients suffering Unipolar Depression.
C	In particular , there is emphasis on the first episode of depression corresponding to the notion of reducing the duration of untreated illness.

P	In recent years , the rise of cross-sector alliances ( CSAs ) in education has elicited growing concerns regarding the unrestrained influence of external partners.
P	Against this backdrop , this study aims to explore the ways in which public schools perceive and collaborate with nonsystem actors ( NSAs ).
M	Using a qualitative design , 32 in-depth interviews with 29 school CSA coordinators responsible for managing 32 civic education CSAs in Israel were triangulated with CSA email correspondence and completed feedback forms.
M	Data were coded and analyzed using categorical techniques.
R	Three main themes emerged from our data: identity of the public education system , pedagogic identity of the school , and collaboration and mutuality.
R	While concerned by the threat of CSAs to public education , school coordinators expressed confidence in their ability to protect their school's identity from NSA influence via twin strategies of regulation and adaptation.
R	However , our analysis revealed that by avoiding substantial engagement with NSAs , the coordinators effectively ceded control to them over educational activities.
R	We propose two new theoretical constructs to categorize alliances: reproductive mutuality , in which schools effectively accept the ideology and programs of NSAs , by a form of soft coercion ; and transformative mutuality , in which school coordinators and NSA representatives engage in substantive dialogue about educational values , goals , and methods , leading to pedagogical innovation and protecting the public school ethos.
C	The findings suggest that schools expand their involvement in vetting , monitoring , and activating CSA programs ; protect teachers' professional status ; encourage knowledge transfer ; and foster transformative mutuality to propel socioeducational change.
B	The role of care coordinator was introduced to support patients , caregivers , and healthcare professionals who work within a specialty , as well as to optimize and standardize care.
B	Specifically , the role of neuro-oncology care coordinator is a developing one-and one that has encountered various barriers and difficulties.
B	Patients diagnosed with neurologic cancer must endure a disease trajectory and multimodal treatment approach that present unique challenges to themselves and to the healthcare system.
B	Consequently , the care coordinator role is needed.
P	This article focuses on the role of the neuro-oncology care coordinator , including its challenges , the needs of patients with neurologic cancer , and the benefits this role can bring.
M	Three neuro-oncology care coordinators from New South Wales , Australia , discussed their role in the healthcare system via structured meetings , conversations , and email correspondence.
R	Making others aware of the issues faced by neuro-oncology care coordinators , as well as their patients , may help to solidify necessary supportive roles within the healthcare system.
B	As part of the Charleston Area Pollution Prevention Partnership ( CAPs ) , studies have been performed to address environmental health issues using various techniques including Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) mapping.
B	Most of the mapping has been conducted by academic team members ; however , there is a need for more community-based mapping to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of community-driven efforts to eliminate environmental hazards and health disparities.
B	The emergence of public participatory GIS ( PPGIS ) has been shown as a way to democratize science , build community capacity , and empower local citizens to address environmental health issues.
P	This article describes the development of the Environmental Justice ( EJ ) Radar , a PPGIS tool that provides stakeholders in South Carolina with a way to raise environmental awareness and improve citizen participation in local environmental decision-making.
P	We describe the functionality of EJ Radar and discuss feedback received from stakeholders to improve the utility of the PPGIS tool.
B	Understanding the effect of the context of simulation to learning and performance is critical to ensure not only optimal learning but to provide a valid and reliable means to evaluate performance.
B	The purpose of this study is to identify influences on performance from the student perspective and understand the contextual barriers inherent in simulation before using simulation for high-stakes testing.
M	This study used a qualitative descriptive design.
M	Senior nursing students ( N = 29 ) provided nursing care during simulation.
M	Vocalized thoughts during simulation and reflective debriefing were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim.
M	Thematic analysis was conducted on transcribed data.
R	Student performance during simulation was influenced by anxiety , uncertainty , technological limitations , and experience with the patient condition.
R	Students had few previous simulation-based learning experiences that may have influenced performance.
C	More needs to be understood regarding factors affecting simulation performance before pass-or-fail decisions are made using this technology.
B	Alcohol use has decreased among Swedish adolescents in the past few decades.
B	We examined peer and parent factors ( i.e. time spent with peers , time spent with parents and parental monitoring ) that could contribute to explaining this trend by investigating their main effects and interaction effects with investigation years on alcohol use.
B	We furthermore examined whether municipality-level socioeconomic conditions could contribute to explaining the trend.
M	We used data from a repeated cross-sectional study that took place eight times between 1988 and 2011.
M	The study targeted all ninth grade students ( 15-16 years old ) in Varmland County , Sweden.
M	Adolescents ( N=22 257 ) reported their monthly alcohol use , time spent with peers and parents and parental monitoring.
M	Municipality-level socioeconomic conditions were based on parent education levels.
R	Logistic multilevel regression analyses showed that peer and parent factors and municipality-level socioeconomic conditions were associated with alcohol use among adolescents.
R	The interaction effects between peer and parent factors and investigation years were not significant.
R	The decreased trend in time spent with peers was associated with the decreased trend in frequency of alcohol use over time.
C	The findings of the current study provide an indication that the decreased trend in alcohol use that has been observed in Swedish adolescents over the past few decades may be related to changes in adolescents' social interactions with peers.
B	The aging process reduces both sensory capabilities and the capabilities of the motor systems responsible for postural control , resulting in a high number of falls among the elderly.
B	Some therapeutic interventions can directly interrupt this process , including physical exercise.
B	This study compares and examines the effects of two exercise protocols on the balance of elderly women.
M	Elderly women who participated in a local church project ( n = 63 ) were randomly divided into three groups: the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation group ( PNFG ) , Pilates group ( PG ) , and control group ( CG ).
M	Of the 63 women , 58 completed the program.
M	A training program involving 50-min sessions was performed in the PNFG and PG three times a week for 4 weeks.
M	The elderly women in the CG received no intervention and continued with their daily activities.
M	Stabilometric parameters , the Berg Balance Scale score , functional reach test , and timed up and go test ( TUG test ) were assessed before and 1 month after participation.
R	In the comparison among groups , the women in the PNFG showed a significant reduction in most of the stabilometric parameters evaluated and better Berg Balance Scale score , functional reach test result , and TUG test result than did women in the CG ( p < 0.05 ).
R	Women in the PG showed significantly better performance on the functional reach test and TUG test than did women in the CG ( p < 0.05 ).
C	Women in the PNFG showed significantly better static and dynamic balance than did women in the CG.
C	Women in the PG also showed better dynamic balance than did women in the CG.
C	However , no significant differences were observed in any of the balance variables assessed between the PNFG and PG.
B	Childhood and adolescent cancers are uncommon , but they have important economic and health impacts on patients , families , and health care systems.
B	Few studies have measured the economic burden of care for childhood and adolescent cancers.
P	To estimate costs of cancer care in population-based cohorts of children and adolescents from the public payer perspective.
M	We identified patients with cancer , aged 91 days to 19 years , diagnosed from 1995 to 2009 using cancer registry data , and matched each to three noncancer controls.
M	Using linked administrative health care records , we estimated total and net resource-specific costs ( in 2012 Canadian dollars ) during 90 days prediagnosis and 1 year postdiagnosis.
R	Children ( <= 14 years old ) numbered 4 ,396: 36% had leukemia , 21% central nervous system tumors , 10% lymphoma , and 33% other cancers.
R	Adolescents ( 15-19 years old ) numbered 2 ,329: 28.9% had lymphoma.
R	Bone and soft tissue sarcoma , germ cell tumor , and thyroid carcinoma each comprised 12% to 13%.
R	Mean net prediagnosis costs were $5 ,810 and $1 ,127 and mean net postdiagnosis costs were $136 ,413 and $62 ,326 for children and adolescents , respectively ; the highest were for leukemia ( $157 ,764 for children and $172 ,034 for adolescents ).
R	In both cohorts , costs were much higher for patients who died within 1 year of diagnosis.
R	Inpatient hospitalization represented 69% to 74% of postdiagnosis costs.
C	Treating children with cancer is costly , more costly than treating adolescents or adults.
C	Substantial survival gains in children mean that treatment may still be very costeffective.
C	Comprehensive age-specific population-based cost estimates are essential to reliably assess the cost-effectiveness of cancer care for children and adolescents , and measure health system performance.
B	In Finland , slippery snowy or icy ground surface conditions can be quite hazardous to human health during wintertime.
B	We focused on the impacts of the variability in weather conditions on tourists' health via documented accidents during the winter season in the Sotkamo area.
B	We attempted to estimate the slipping hazard in a specific context of space and time focusing on the weather and other possible parameters , responsible for fluctuations in the numbers of injuries/accidents ; ( 2 )
M	We used statistical distributions with graphical illustrations to examine the distribution of visits to Kainuu Hospital by non-local patients and their characteristics/causes ; graphs to illustrate the distribution of the different characteristics of weather conditions ; questionnaires and interviews conducted among health care and safety personnel in Sotkamo and Kuusamo ; ( 3 )
R	There was a clear seasonal distribution in the numbers and types of extremity injuries of non-local patients.
R	While the risk of slipping is emphasized , other factors leading to injuries are evaluated ; and ( 4 )
C	The study highlighted the clear role of wintery weather conditions as a cause of extremity injuries even though other aspects must also be considered.
C	Future scenarios , challenges and adaptive strategies are also discussed from the viewpoint of climate change.
B	Chemical hazard communication is intended to alert users of the potential hazards of chemicals.
B	Hazard information needs to be understood and recalled.
B	Recall of hazard communication is critical when the written form of the information is not available at the time it is required.
M	A cross-sectional study investigating associations between recall of chemical safety information on labels amongst 402 participants including 315 workers and 87 consumers in two provinces of South Africa.
R	Respondents were predominantly male ( 67.7% ) , the median age was 37 years ( IQR: 30-46 years ) and less than half of the participants completed high school ( 47.5% ).
R	Multivariate analysis identified the following positive associations with the recall of all the label elements listing the strongest association: call appropriate services and industrial vs consumer sector ( OR = 2.4 ; 95% CI: 1.2 ; 4.6 ) ; call appropriate services and transport vs consumer sector ( OR = 4.4 ; 95% CI: 1.2 ; 16.0 ) ; flammable symbol and male vs female gender ( OR = 23 ; 95% CI: 1.0 ; 53 ) ; flammable symbofand home language English vs African languages ( OR = 6.6 ; 95% CI: 2.1 ; 21.2 ) ; any hazard statement and home language Afrikaans vs African languages ( OR = 14.0 ; 95% CI: 3.6 ; 54.2 ) , any first aid statement and further education vs none ( OR = 33 ; 95% CI: 1.3 ; 8.0 ) , correct chemical name and industry blue collar workers vs non-industry blue collar workers ( OR = 2.6 ; 95% CI: 1.1 ; 6.1 ) , correct chemical name and non-industry white collar occupations vs non-industry blue collar workers ( OR = 2.7 ; 95% Cl: 1.0 ; 7.1 ).
C	The study found a number of potential positive associations which influence recall of label elements of which some ( e.g. , sector , gender , occupation ) suggest further research.
C	Relevant policies in South Africa should ensure that the safety information on chemical labels is clearly visible to read and understandable which aids recall and the reduction in harmful chemical exposures.

B	Psychosocial work factors and general recovery experiences are hypothesised to influence the risk of low back pain ( LBP ) occurrence by influencing the acute recovery-stress state.
B	So far , however , direct links between the acute recovery-stress state and LBP occurrence have not been investigated in detail.
P	The aim of this study was to investigate differences in low back pain occurrence between four distinct recovery-stress groups over a period of 6 month.
M	A prospective cohort study with a 3-month and 6-month follow-up measurement was conducted in a sample of administrative employees ( N = 271 ).
M	First , the sample was divided into four distinct recovery-stress groups by cluster analysis.
M	Subsequently , differences in LBP occurrence between these four groups and the Relative Risk ( RR ) were analysed.
R	Overall , groups with higher stress than recovery scores showed a higher risk of LBP occurrence compared to those groups with lower stress than recovery scores.
R	Furthermore , the group with the highest stress and lowest recovery scores showed a significant higher proportion of LBP occurrence after six months than the group with the lowest stress and highest recovery scores ( RR = 7.29 ).
C	The results indicate the relevance of the acute recovery-stress state for LBP occurrence.
B	The causes of the recent rise of tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) incidence in Europe are discussed.
B	Our objective was to estimate the impact of air temperature change on TBE incidence in the European part of the Russian Arctic.
M	We analysed the TBE incidence in the Komi Republic ( RK ) over a 42-year period in relation to changes in local annual average air temperature , air temperature during the season of tick activity , tick abundance , TBE-prevalence in ticks , tick-bite incidence rate , and normalised difference vegetation index within the area under study.
R	In 1998-2011 in RK a substantial growth of TBE virus ( TBEV ) prevalence both in questing and feeding ticks was observed.
R	In 1992-2011 there was 23-fold growth of the tick-bite incidence rate in humans , a northward shift of the reported tick bites , and the season of tick bites increased from 4 to 6 months.
R	In 1998-2011 there was more than 6-fold growth of average annual TBE incidence compared with 1970-1983 and 1984-1997 periods.
R	This resulted both from the northward shift of TBE , and its growth in the south.
R	In our view it was related to local climate change as both the average annual air temperature , and the air temperature during the tick activity season grew substantially.
R	We revealed in RK a strong correlation between the change in the air temperature and that in TBE incidence.
R	The satellite data showed NDVI growth within RK , i.e. alteration of the local ecosystem under the influence of climate change.
C	The rise in TBE incidence in RK is related considerably to the expansion of the range of Ixodes persulcatus.
C	The territory with reported TBE cases also expanded northward.
C	Climate change is an important driver of TBE incidence rate growth.
B	A remote sensing technique was developed which combines a Geographic Information System ( GIS ) ; Google Earth , and Microsoft Excel to identify home locations for a random sample of households in rural Haiti.
B	The method was used to select homes for ethnographic and water quality research in a region of rural Haiti located within 9 km of a local hospital and source of health education in Deschapelles , Haiti.
B	The technique does not require access to governmental records or ground based surveys to collect household location data and can be performed in a rapid , cost-effective manner.
M	The random selection of households and the location of these households during field surveys were accomplished using GIS , Google Earth , Microsoft Excel , and handheld Garmin GPSmap 76CSx GPS units.
M	Homes were identified and mapped in Google Earth , exported to ArcMap 10.0 , and a random list of homes was generated using Microsoft Excel which was then loaded onto handheld GPS units for field location.
M	The development and use of a remote sensing method was essential to the selection and location of random households.
M	\
R	A total of 537 homes initially were mapped and a randomized subset of 96 was identified as potential survey locations.
R	Over 96% of the homes mapped using Google Earth imagery were correctly identified as occupied dwellings.
R	Only 3.6% of the occupants of mapped homes visited declined to be interviewed.
R	16.4% of the homes visited were not occupied at the time of the visit due to work away from the home or market days.
R	A total of 55 households were located using this method during the 10 days of fieldwork in May and June of 2012.
C	The method used to generate and field locate random homes for surveys and water sampling was an effective means of selecting random households in a rural environment lacking geolocation infrastructure.
C	The success rate for locating households using a handheld GPS was excellent and only rarely was local knowledge required to identify and locate households.
C	This method provides an important technique that can be applied to other developing countries where a randomized study design is needed but infrastructure is lacking to implement more traditional participant selection methods.
P	This study was designed to test the relative efficacy of different combinations of intervention approaches when targeting speech production accuracy and phonological awareness skills.
P	All children received individual speech therapy , a home program , and a small-group phonological awareness intervention.
M	Sixty-five 4-year-olds with a developmental phonological disorder received these intervention components in different combinations over 12 weeks , resulting in 4 groups: output-oriented individual intervention and articulation practice home program , output-oriented individual intervention and dialogic reading home program , inputoriented individual intervention and articulation practice home program , and input-oriented individual intervention and dialogic reading home program.
R	A significant interaction of the individual treatment condition and the home program condition was observed for 2 outcome measures: targeted feature match ( which reflected changes in speech production accuracy for features and word shape structures that were targeted in therapy ) and explicit phonological awareness skills.
C	In this context , in which the children received a brief period of direct therapy and a home program component provided sequentially , the most effective strategy was to teach the parents to use treatment procedures at home that were congruent with the direct therapy component.
B	Although several studies have identified flavored alcoholic beverages ( FABs ) as being popular among underage drinkers , no previous study has ascertained the prevalence of brand-specific FAB consumption among a national sample of underage youth.
P	To ascertain the brand-specific consumption prevalence and consumption share of FABs among a national sample of underage drinkers in the United States.
M	In 2012 , we conducted an online , self-administered survey of a national sample of 1031 underage drinkers , ages 13-20 years , to determine the prevalence of past 30-day consumption for each of 898 alcoholic beverage brands , including 62 FABs , and each brand's youth consumption share , based on the estimated total number of standard drinks consumed.
M	There were three brand-specific outcome measures: prevalence of consumption , prevalence of consumption during heavy episodic drinking , and consumption share , defined as the percentage of the total drinks consumed by all respondents combined that was attributable to a particular brand.
R	The FAB brands with the highest prevalence of past 30-day consumption were Smirnoff malt beverages , 17.7% ; Mike's , 10.8% ; Bacardi malt beverages , 8.0% ; and Four Loko/Four MaXed , 6.1%.
R	Just five brands accounted for almost half ( 49.1% ) of the total consumption share by volume within the FAB category.
C	Flavored alcoholic beverages are highly popular among underage drinkers , and the FAB brand preferences of this group are highly concentrated among a small number of brands.
C	To decrease the consumption of FABs by underage youth , all states should reclassify these beverages as distilled spirits rather than beer.
P	Home based care is central to HIV care and support throughout Africa.
P	Most programs have not addressed the unique needs of adolescents living with HIV , who display lower retention in HIV care and treatment adherence.
P	This study examined the experiences of adolescents living with HIV in Tanzania in order to identify ways to improve home based care to better meet their needs.
M	We conducted a qualitative study in Dar es Salaam and Tanga Region consisting of in-depth interviews with 14 adolescents living with HIV , 10 primary caregivers , and 12 providers assigned to their households.
M	Interviews examined adolescents' experiences of growing up with HIV , perceptions of current home based care , and challenges in increasing acceptability of services.
R	We found the program did not align well with adolescents' expectations.
R	Adolescents felt home based care to be more relevant to their caregivers and did not form independent relationships with providers.
R	They expressed anxiety that participation might lead to inadvertent disclosure of their status and consequent discrimination.
R	Both adolescents and their caregivers felt disappointment that no material or financial support was available despite widespread poverty , although they appreciated receiving psychosocial support and practical referrals.
R	Providers demonstrated motivation to work with adolescents but acknowledged lacking requisite skills such as ways to communicate with young people and key messages to deliver.
C	Despite challenges , we identified feasible adaptations to make home based care more adolescent-centered.
C	These include actively engaging adolescents in program design , improving provider training in communication with adolescents , and proactively addressing unrealistic expectations.
C	Finally , increasing referral links to a wider range of services could improve program effectiveness by integrating it into a broader development approach.

P	'Affective prosody' defines the supra-segmental features of speech that , when manipulated , can change the type and intensity of emotion conveyed by the speaker.
P	Although the right hemisphere is predominantly linked to the processing of affective prosodic cues , existing literature also suggests that damage to the left hemisphere can result in similar deficits.
P	This study aims to demonstrate , and add to the evidence , that patients with left-hemisphere injury experience difficulties with affective prosodic perception and production , measured via a new combination of assessments and analyses.
P	It is also hypothesised that aphasia severity will be correlated with impaired processing of affective prosody.
R	Stroke and control participants differed significantly on prosody perception tests of matching auditory affective cues to visual images.
R	Prosodic production was measured by participants vocalising different affective expressions of words and monosyllables - from which significant differences were found in perceptual judgements of emotion accuracy and intensity , and acoustic analyses of pitch range and variance.
R	There were significant correlations between participants' Western Aphasia Battery ( WAB ) scores , quality of life , and prosody production.
C	Individuals with left-hemisphere damage after stroke have impaired affective prosodic perception and production that may be associated with reduced quality of life.

P	This article examines specific manifestations of the generalizations identified by literature in pedagogy in a Chinese university.
M	Five open questions were asked of the university's five technical communication instructors in a 90-minute focus-group interview session to identify the important areas in pedagogy as conditioned by Chinese culture.
M	The 300 students were surveyed to reveal their understanding of technical communication as it existed in China.
M	Features as conditioned by Chinese culture and as manifested in the 300 students were also identified through my teaching and observing their performance in class.
R	The five instructors taught the same lessons and the same course content determined by the university.
R	They focused on teaching professional terms and phrases.
R	They administered examinations throughout a semester to help students memorize the terms.
R	The 300 students generally thought that technical communication was about science and technology.
R	The general audience of technical communication , for them , was basically their country , and the purpose was to serve their country and society.
R	In class , these students often studied through collaboration in groups ; they memorized almost everything from their professor ; and they preferred a broad thinking style to tackling broad issues.
C	Technical communication pedagogy is governed by Confucianism and the test-oriented Chinese society.
C	In class , students were motivated by the collectivism Chinese culture stresses.
C	Students' rote learning approach was influenced by their traditional way of learning , and the broad thinking style was a textual mechanism for students to complete assignments while upholding patriotism.
B	How to shape medical education to combine professional knowledge with humanistic personal development is a never-ending process for medical schools in general.
B	The Medical School of the University Ljubljana has been introducing a tutor system recently.
B	Workshops promoting self-reflexivity and coping with stress have been offered for tutors and mentors as a kind of faculty and personnel development initiative.
M	The participants were all volunteers , motivated by further development of their teaching and tutorial skills.
M	The workshop was based on a sequence of phases ( the definition of the target and of the existing state , the sequence of interventions , implementation and an evaluation of the changes ) that were pertinent to the basic goal of the workshops: to recognize , experience and apply self reflexivity and coping with stress as two urgent , general and essential factors for functional personal and group change.
M	The workshop covered themes connecting the following issues: reflexive communication , introducing changes into systems , power position and the use of power by the tutor/mentor , understanding different individual learning styles and the motivation for learning.
M	The workshops are based on a systemic type of learning with the co-creation of the participants.
R	The workshop supported the tutors' reflective curiosity about medical students by discovering individual strengths , by identifying obstacles in the learning process and by the pluralistic idea of equifinality - achieving the same goal in different ways.
R	The workshop tried to translate implicit knowledge into explicit principles and to challenge identified automatic cognitive repetitive patterns in the experiential part of workshop with designated exercises.
B	Recent methodological advancements should catalyze the evaluation of measurement invariance across groups , which is required for conducting meaningful cross-group comparisons.
P	The aim of this study was to apply a state-of-the-art statistical method for comparing latent mean scores and evaluating measurement invariance across managers' and frontline workers' ratings of the organization of hospital care.
M	On the 87 nursing units in a single institution , French-speaking and Dutch-speaking nursing unit managers' and staff nurses' ratings of their work environment were measured using the multidimensional 32-item practice environment scale of the nursing work index ( PES-NWI ).
M	Measurement invariance and latent mean scores were evaluated in the form of a Bayesian 2-level multiple indicators multiple causes model with covariates at the individual nurse and nursing unit level.
M	Role ( manager , staff nurse ) and language ( French , Dutch ) are of primary interest.
R	Language group membership accounted for 7 of 11 PES-NWI items showing measurement noninvariance.
R	Cross-group comparisons also showed that covariates at both within-level and between-level had significant effects on PES-NWI latent mean scores.
R	Most notably , nursing unit managers , when compared with staff nurses , hold more positive views of several PES-NWI dimensions.
C	Using a widely used instrument for measuring nurses' work environment , this study shows that precautions for the potential threat of measurement noninvariance are necessary in all stages of a study that relies on survey data to compare groups , particularly in multilingual settings.
C	A Bayesian multilevel multiple indicators multiple causes approach can accommodate for detecting all possible instances of noninvariance for multiple covariates of interest at the within-level and between-level jointly.
P	This article reports on the development of a self-report tool-the Chinese Hearing Aid Outcomes Questionnaire ( CHAOQ )-to evaluate hearing aid outcomes among Chinese speakers.
M	There were 4 phases to construct the CHAOQ and evaluate its psychometric properties.
M	First , items were selected to evaluate a range of culturally relevant outcomes.
M	These procedures provided evidence for face and content validity.
M	Second , items with inappropriate psychometric properties were eliminated.
M	Items related to listening performance were subjected to exploratory factor analysis to identify the factor structure , which was later confirmed via a confirmatory factor analysis in Phase III.
M	These procedures also ensured content and discriminant validity.
M	Internal consistency reliability was evaluated , and normative data were obtained.
M	Finally , test-retest reliability was evaluated , and construct validity was established by comparing results with corresponding items from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids.
R	The final 26-item CHAOQ contains ( a ) 3 scales evaluating speech understanding in situations in which communication is relatively more difficult or easy or includes reduced listening cues ; ( b ) a scale evaluating listening comfort ; ( c ) a scale measuring negative responses ; and ( d ) an item measuring overall satisfaction.
C	The CHAOQ possesses good reliability and validity.
B	A suicide awareness campaign was initiated in the Austrian federal state of Styria to increase help-seeking behavior in the population.
B	Billboards were shown throughout Styria depicting joyful everyday-life situations with a focus on social and family connectedness , and promoting the Telephone Emergency Service , a crisis hotline.
P	The present study investigated the impact of this campaign on the utilization of the crisis hotline and on suicide rates.
M	Phone calls and suicide rates in the study region 3 months before the campaign were compared with rates 3 months after the campaign.
M	The changes were contrasted with the characteristics of phone calls and the suicide rate in a comparable control region.
R	There were significantly more phone calls in the study region after the awareness campaign compared to the control region , which was similar to seasonal trends in nonintervention years , and there was no increase of suicide-related phone calls.
R	The proportion of suicide-related phone calls referring to family problems decreased after the initiation of the campaign.
R	Suicide rates did not change.
C	The campaign may have had some minor immediate impact on the utilization of the Telephone Emergency Service , but it did not seem to motivate suicidal individuals , especially those with family problems , to call.
B	Medical students at the University of Virginia ( UVA ) are mentored and learn within the framework of a four college learning community.
B	Uniquely , these learning communities are used to organize the third-year clerkship rotations.
M	Students were surveyed after their first pre-clinical year and after their clerkship year to determine what the effect of the learning community was on their social and educational interpersonal relationships.
R	Students knew a higher percentage of their college mates after completing their third-year clerkships within the framework of the college system.
R	Students chose peers from within the college system for social and educational interpersonal scenarios statistically more often than what would be expected at random.
R	Small group learning environments that were not formed within the framework of the college system at UVA did not have the same effect on interpersonal relationships , indicating that learning communities are uniquely able to provide a context for relationship building.
R	Students felt more positively about the social and educational effects of the college system after the clerkship year , with a corresponding increase in the strength of their interpersonal bonds with their college peers.
C	This work is the first to investigate the effects of learning communities on interpersonal relationships among medical students and finds that learning communities positively impact both social and educational medical student bonds.
B	To examine whether a clinically meaningful alcohol consumption cutoff can be created for clinical samples , we used receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curves to derive gender-specific consumption cutoffs that maximized sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of a wide range of negative consequences from drinking.
M	We conducted secondary data analyses using data from two large clinical trials targeting alcohol use disorders: Project MATCH ( n = 1726 ) and COMBINE ( n=1383 ).
R	In both studies , we found that the ideal cutoff for men and women that maximized sensitivity/specificity varied substantially both across different alcohol consumption variables and alcohol consequence outcomes.
R	Further , the levels of sensitivity/specificity were poor across all consequences.
C	These results fail to provide support for a clinically meaningful alcohol consumption cutoff and suggest that binary classification of levels of alcohol consumption is a poor proxy for maximizing sensitivity/specificity in the prediction of negative consequences from drinking.
C	Future research examining consumption-consequence associations should take advantage of continuous measures of alcohol consumption and alternative approaches for assessing the link between levels of consumption and consequences ( e.g. , ecological momentary assessment ).
C	Clinical researchers should consider focusing more directly on the consequences they aim to reduce instead of relying on consumption as a proxy for more clinically meaningful outcomes.

B	In 2007 , Israel passed a law to extend existing restrictions on smoking in public places and to strengthen enforcement.
B	Responsibility for ensuring smoke-free indoor public places was placed on establishment owners.
B	Bars and pubs were included in the law for the first time.
B	This study aimed to assess changes in air quality in popular Israeli bars , pubs and cafes after the implementation of law , and to examine changes in patron numbers , percentage of smoking patrons and venue-seating sections.
M	Air quality was determined by measuring respirable suspended particles ( PM2.5 mu g( -3 ) ) in 33 randomly selected venues in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , including bars , pubs and cafes , before and after law implementation.
M	Numbers of patrons and smoking patrons were recorded.
R	Average respirable small particles ( RSP ) level was 245 mu g( -3 ) prior to implementation and 161 mu g( -3 ) following implementation of the law , representing a decline of 34% ( P = 0.0043 ).
R	RSP levels decreased in bars and pubs and in cafes.
R	Percentage of smoking patrons declined from 19% to 9% ( P = 0.0036 ).
R	The magnitude of the effect decreased over time ( P = 0.0039 ).
R	Non-smoking establishments were more common following the legislation ( P = 0.0047 ).
C	Indoor air pollution from second-hand smoke in Israeli bars , pubs and cafes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv declined following the implementation of law.
C	This demonstrates that a law to extend existing restrictions and enforcement policies may help protect workers and patrons from tobacco smoke.
C	However , RSP levels in Israeli bars and pubs , especially in Tel Aviv , remain unacceptably high.
C	Enforced , 100% smoke-free laws are essential for complete protection.
B	Objective methods of differentiating unipolar versus bipolar depression would enhance our ability to treat these disorders by providing more accurate diagnoses.
B	One first step towards developing diagnostic methodology is determining whether brain function as assessed by functional MRI ( fMRI ) and functional connectivity analyses might differentiate the two disorders.
M	Fourteen subjects with bipolar II depression and 26 subjects with recurrent unipolar depression were studied using fMRI and functional connectivity analyses.
R	The first key finding of this study was that functional connectivity of the right posterior cingulate cortex differentiates bipolar II and unipolar depression.
R	Additionally , results suggest that functional connectivity of this region is associated with suicidal ideation and depression severity in unipolar but not bipolar II depression.
C	The primary limitation is the relatively small sample size , particularly for the correlational analyses.
C	The functional connectivity of right posterior cingulate cortex may differential unipolar from bipolar II depression.
C	Further , connectivity of this region may be associated with depression severity and suicide risk in unipolar but not bipolar depression.

B	The construct of insight in psychosis assumes congruence between patient and clinician views of the meaning of symptoms and experience.
B	Current definitions and measures of insight do not give systematic attention to the impact of interpersonal , cultural and socio-economic contexts.
P	We hypothesized that socio-cultural factors influence insight in patients with schizophrenia.
M	We tested this hypothesis through comparison of insight in 18 triads , each composed of a patient , a family member and a clinician.
M	The sample consisted of patients who were first diagnosed with psychosis in the last two years , and who were either immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean Islands , or Canadian born.
M	Insight was assessed by analysis of narratives collected from patients , family members and clinicians for a research project on the negotiation of treatment.
M	Each narrative was scored for insight along multiple dimensions with the Extracted Insight Scale ( EIS ) , developed for this project.
R	There was a significant correlation of insight on the EIS between patients and family members ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.03 ) but not between patient and clinician or family and clinician.
R	The mean levels of insight across the three groups were comparable.
R	Qualitative analysis of the illness narratives suggested that insight was based on the meanings constructed around psychotic experiences and that the process of interpreting and attributing psychotic experiences reflected each person's cultural background , life experiences , and other social determinants , especially stigma.
C	Forms of insight can occur in the context of discordance or disagreement with the clinician's opinion.
C	We present a testable model of the sociocultural determinants of insight that can guide future studies.
B	This paper describes an evaluation of a redevelopment program in a mental health service for older people , stimulated by U. K. Department of Health policy.
B	IQCOL ( Improving Quality of Care for Older People in Lambeth ) was a two-year program to modernize and expand an inner-city service , with objectives to improve access , embed new functions , and tune the service towards the needs of the local community.
B	The program evaluation aimed to contribute to knowledge on service planning and methodology for evaluating complex interventions.
M	The study evaluated the progress and outcomes of this multifaceted program.
M	The realist model of evaluation was followed , with a dual emphasis on utility and generalizability.
M	With an iterative approach , the pragmatic , longitudinal design comprised a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explain the process of change and to measure achievement of objectives.
R	A high level of participation in evaluation activities was achieved.
R	The workforce generally responded well to the program.
R	However , progress in one team was hindered by understaffing and resistance to change , emphasizing that while localized provision may be desirable , team viability requires adequate resources and professional support.
R	Improved access was indicated by a 13% increase of referrals.
R	Data suggested earlier referral of dementia cases.
R	Carer support was implemented , but assertive outreach was impeded by professional boundary issues.
R	Ethnicity data showed that the service was responding to demographic trends.
R	Positive views towards the program were associated with team resources and recent professional training.
C	This case study demonstrates how whole system change can be achieved if sufficient attention is given to the needs of staff implementing the program.
C	The evaluation emphasizes the importance of context in producing generalizable evidence on service development , and contributes useful methodological insights.
P	In the present study , we examined the effect of working while seated , while standing , or while walking on measures of short-term memory , working memory , selective and sustained attention , and information-processing speed.
B	The advent of computer-based technology has revolutionized the adult workplace , such that average adult full-time employees spend the majority of their working day seated.
B	Prolonged sitting is associated with increasing obesity and chronic health conditions in children and adults.
B	One possible intervention to reduce the negative health impacts of the modern office environment involves modifying the workplace to increase incidental activity and exercise during the workday.
B	Although modifications , such as sit-stand desks , have been shown to improve physiological function , there is mixed information regarding the impact of such office modification on individual cognitive performance and thereby the efficiency of the work environment.
M	In a fully counterbalanced randomized control trial , we assessed the cognitive performance of 45 undergraduate students for up to a 1-hr period in each condition.
R	The results indicate that there is no significant change in the measures used to assess cognitive performance associated with working while seated , while standing , or while walking at low intensity.
C	These results indicate that cognitive performance is not degraded with short-term use of alternate workstations.
B	Domestic violence and harmful alcohol consumption are considered major public health problems worldwide.
B	These phenomena often co-occur , and they share several risk factors.
B	Nevertheless , few in-depth studies have supported integrated interventions for both phenomena , in particular among Latin American women.
B	This project will study the consumption of alcoholic beverages among women and its relationship with patterns of domestic violence ; furthermore , it will assess the effect of a brief intervention ( BI ) aimed at modifying these behaviors using a community household sample.
M	This project is divided into two studies.
M	Study 1 will employ a cross-sectional observational design and will be conducted using a household sample of adult women ( approximate sample size = 1600 ) to assess harmful alcohol consumption and domestic violence patterns.
M	Study 2 , will be a randomized clinical trial based on specific cases from Study 1 , assessing the effect of a brief intervention on women who exhibit harmful levels of alcohol consumption ( AUDIT >= 8 ).
M	Approximately 73 women will be assigned to one of two groups , either a treated group ( TG ) or a control group ( CG ).
M	A sociodemographic questionnaire , a questionnaire concerning general health and substance use , and four other standardized instruments ( i.e. , the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT ; used to investigate problems related to alcohol consumption] , the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D ; used to measure depressive symptoms] , and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales and Parent-child Conflict Tactics Scales [CTS2 and CTSPC ; used to obtain information on violence among couples and between parents and children , respectively] ) will be used to collect data.
C	The study protocol will employ a household survey of a representative sample from a neighborhood in a middle income country , where well-conducted household surveys remain rare.
C	The present work represents a step toward a better understanding of violence in women's lives and its interaction with alcohol consumption and expands the discussion on the potential strategies for public health actions seeking to prevent both domestic violence and harmful alcohol consumption.
B	Young pregnant women who continue a pregnancy are primarily from a socio-economically deprived background.
B	The risk factors associated with low socio-economic status may independently affect perinatal and neonatal morbidity to a greater extent than the young age of the woman.
B	Young pregnant women are frequently sceptical about health care providers who they can perceive to be judgemental.
B	This may lead to late booking for pregnancy care , attending few appointments , or not attending the health service for any antenatal care.
B	Question: Does the way maternity care is provided affect maternal and neonatal outcomes for young women?
M	A systematic search of the major health databases.
R	Nine research articles met the eligibility criteria: one randomised controlled trial , three prospective cohort studies , two comparative studies with concurrent controls , two comparative studies with historical controls , and one case series.
C	Providing young women with a non-standard model of maternity care has some beneficial and no known detrimental effects on childbirth outcomes.
C	While there is a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of a Midwifery Group Practice model of care for young women , there is strong evidence to suggest that a Group Antenatal Care model increases antenatal visit attendance and breastfeeding initiation , and decreases the risk of preterm birth.
C	There is research to indicate that a Young Women's Clinic model may also increase antenatal visit attendance and decrease the incidence of preterm birth.
C	More well-designed and resourced midwifery models of care for young women should be implemented and rigorously researched.

B	Evidence suggests that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be useful in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease ( AD ).
P	In an open-label trial of safety and tolerability of nilvadipine in patients with AD , we examined cognition and executive function over a short time period to determine an influence of nilvadipine on these outcomes.
M	We investigated change in cognition using the Mini mental state examination and in executive function using the EXIT25 in 55 patients with AD who received nilvadipine 8 mg daily for 6 weeks compared with 30 non-treated subjects with AD.
M	Apolipoprotein E genotyping was performed , and the study team and caregivers were kept blinded to APOE epsilon 4 status during the trial.
R	Aside from differences in gender and education , both the treatment and the control groups were similar in general demographics and on baseline cognition status.
R	After correction for potential confounders , APOE epsilon 4 status , and use of other antihypertensive medications , a significant impact of study intervention was observed on MMSE ( F = 8.67 , p < 0.01 ) and EXIT ( F = 8.77 , p < 0.03 ) scores.
R	An interaction between APOE epsilon 4 carrier status and treatment ( p = 0.05 ) was observed for both outcome measures.
C	In this open-label trial , among APOE epsilon 4 non-carriers , we observed stabilization of cognition and improvement in executive function among treated individuals compared with non-treated individuals.
C	Among APOE epsilon 4 carriers , cognitive stabilization was evident for treated individuals whereas a cognitive decline was observed in non-treated individuals.
C	These findings provide additional evidence for potential therapeutic efficacy of nilvadipine in treating AD and warrant further investigation.

B	Data on real-world rehospitalization risks in patients using different drugs and combination therapies for relapse prevention after a manic episode is limited.
M	We conducted a nationwide population based cohort study using data from Swedish national registers.
M	Swedish residents aged 18-75 years who were hospitalized for a manic episode between July 1 , 2006 and December 2 , 2014 were included.
M	Prescription fills of lithium , valproate , olanzapine , quetiapine and aripiprazole were recorded throughout the first four weeks after hospital discharge , after which the patients were followed for up to one year.
M	General and treatment specific rehospitalization risks were determined and results were adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic factors.
R	The study included follow-up data from 6 502 hospitalizations for mania.
R	Pharmacologic relapse prevention was used after 78% of these hospitalizations.
R	Monotherapies and combination therapies were equally common.
R	The average one-year rehospitalization risk for patients who did versus did not initiate prophylactic treatment was 39% and 46% , respectively.
R	The lowest rehospitalization risks were seen in patients on combination therapy with olanzapine and valproate or olanzapine and lithium , experiencing one year rehospitalization risks of 32% and 34% ( adjusted hazard ratios 0.76 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.93 ) and 0.83 ( 95% CI 0.70-0.98 ) , compared to lithium monotherapy ).
C	Register data does not provide information on all clinical parameters affecting treatment choices.
C	One-year rehospitalization rates after a manic episode are considerable also for patients who initiate prophylactic treatment.
C	Combination therapies including olanzapine and a classic mood-stabilizer may be beneficial for reducing rehospitalization risks after a manic episode.
B	Employment is a key determinant of health disparity.
B	We examined gender-specific relationships between employment status and health outcomes among Brazilian adults.
M	Nationally representative data ( n=463 223 ) came from the 2003 and 2008 Brazilian National Household Surveys.
M	Logistic regressions were performed to estimate gender-specific associations between employment status and health outcomes.
R	Compared with employed counterparts , the odds of depression were higher among unemployed men ( AOR 2.04 ; 95% CI 1.80-2.32 ) and women ( AOR 1.60 ; 95% CI 1.49-1.72 ).
R	Economically inactive men were more likely to report depression than their employed counterparts ( AOR 3.33 ; 95% CI 3.08-3.59 ) , whereas the effect was smaller for economically inactive women ( AOR 2.24 ; 95% CI 1.19-1.29 ).
R	Compared with their employed counterparts , the odds of functional limitation were higher among economically inactive men ( AOR 6.61 ; 95% CI 5.90-7.41 ) and women ( AOR 1.95 ; 95% CI 1.83-2.08 ).
R	The odds of very poor or poor self-rated health were higher among economically inactive men ( AOR 4.58 ; 95% CI 4.28-4.90 ) and women ( AOR 1.53 ; 95% CI 1.44-1.62 ) than among employed counterparts.
R	Unemployed men were more likely to report poor health compared with those employed ( AOR 1.26 ; 95% CI 1.09-1.46 ) ; whereas no difference in very poor or poor self-rated health was found between employed and unemployed women.
C	Employment was associated with better health outcomes among Brazilian adults.
C	Policies should also facilitate access to preventive services and adequate treatment to those inactive or unemployed.
B	Machine learning is increasingly used for risk stratification in health care.
B	Achieving accurate predictive models do not improve outcomes if they cannot be translated into efficacious intervention.
B	Here we examine the potential utility of automated risk stratification and referral intervention to screen older adults for fall risk after emergency department ( ED ) visits.
P	This study evaluated several machine learning methodologies for the creation of a risk stratification algorithm using electronic health record data and estimated the effects of a resultant intervention based on algorithm performance in test data.
M	Data available at the time of ED discharge were retrospectively collected and separated into training and test datasets.
M	Algorithms were developed to predict the outcome of a return visit for fall within 6 months of an ED index visit.
M	Models included random forests , AdaBoost , and regression-based methods.
M	We evaluated models both by the area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , also referred to as area under the curve ( AUC ) , and by projected clinical impact , estimating number needed to treat ( NNT ) and referrals per week for a fall risk intervention.
R	The random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.78 , with slightly lower performance in regression-based models.
R	Algorithms with similar performance , when evaluated by AUC , differed when placed into a clinical context with the defined task of estimated NNT in a real-world scenario.
C	The ability to translate the results of our analysis to the potential tradeoff between referral numbers and NNT offers decisionmakers the ability to envision the effects of a proposed intervention before implementation.
B	When assessing the feasibility of surveillance for pancreatic cancer ( PC ) , it is important to address its psychological burden.
B	The aim of this ongoing study is to evaluate the psychological burden of annual pancreatic surveillance for individuals at high risk to develop PC.
M	This is a multicenter prospective study.
M	High-risk individuals who undergo annual pancreatic surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) were invited to complete questionnaires to assess motivations for participating in surveillance , experiences with participation , perceived PC risk , topics of concern , and psychological distress.
M	Questionnaires were sent after intake for participation ( Ti ) , after the first MRI and EUS ( T2 ) , and after the MRI and EUS 1 ( T3 ) , 2 ( T4 ) , and 3 years ( T5 ) after first surveillance.
R	In total , 140 out of 152 individuals returned one or more of the questionnaires ( response 92% ) ; 477 questionnaires were analyzed.
R	The most frequently reported motivation for participating in surveillance was the possible early detection of ( a precursor stage oi ) cancer ( 95-100% ).
R	Only a minority of respondents experienced MRI and EUS as uncomfortable ( 10% and 11% , respectively ) , and respondents dreaded their next EUS investigation less as surveillance progressed.
R	Respondents' cancer worries decreased significantly over time , and both their anxiety and depression scores remained stable and low over the 3-year period of follow-up.
C	The psychological burden of pancreatic surveillance is low at all assessments.
C	Therefore , from a psychological point of view , participation of high-risk individuals in an annual pancreatic surveillance program is feasible.

B	Prior studies suggest being overweight may be protective against poor functional outcomes in older adults.
M	Body mass index ( BMI , kg/m( 2 ) ) was measured over 25 years across five visits ( 1987-2011 ) among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants ( baseline Visit 1 n = 15 ,720 , aged 45-64 years ).
M	Gait speed was measured at Visit 5 ( "late-life" , aged >= 65 years , n = 6 ,229 ).
M	BMI trajectories were examined using clinical cutpoints and continuous mixed models to estimate effects of patterns of BMI change on gait speed , adjusting for demographics and comorbidities.
R	Mid-life BMI ( baseline visit ; 55% women ; 27% black ) was associated with late-life gait speed 25 years later ; gait speeds were 94.3 , 89.6 , and 82.1 cm/s for participants with baseline normal BMI ( <25 ) , overweight ( 25 <= BMI < 30 ) , and obese ( BMI >= 30 ) ( p < .001 ).
R	In longitudinal analyses , late-life gait speeds were 96.9 , 88.8 , and 81.3 cm/s for participants who maintained normal , overweight , and obese weight status , respectively , across 25 years ( p < .01 ).
R	Increasing BMI over 25 years was associated with poorer late-life gait speeds ; a 1%/year BMI increase for a participant with a baseline BMI of 22.5 ( final BMI 28.5 ) was associated with a 4.6-cm/s ( 95% confidence interval: -7.0 , -1.8 ) slower late-life gait speed than a participant who maintained a baseline BMI of 22.5.
C	Being overweight in older age was not protective of mobility function.
C	Maintaining a normal BMI in mid-and late-life may help preserve late-life mobility.
B	In keeping with the need to protect the safety and health of workers , the EU Working Time Directive stipulates that a worker's average working time for each 7-day period , including overtime , does not exceed 48 h.
B	It has , however , not been settled whether or not the threshold at 48 working hours a week is low enough to protect against excess mortality from long work weeks.
B	The aim of the present study was to examine all-cause mortality in relation to weekly working hours among employees in the general population of Denmark.
B	A special attention was given to mortality rates among employees with moderately long work weeks , 41-48 h.
M	Interview data from cohorts of 20-64 year-old employees were drawn from the Danish Labour Force Survey.
M	The participants ( N= 159 933 ) were followed through national registers from the end of the calendar year of the interview ( 1999-2013 ) until the end of 2014.
M	Rate ratios ( RRs ) for all-cause mortality were estimated as a function of weekly working hours while controlling for age , sex , social class , night-time work and calendar year.
R	We found 3374 deaths during an average follow-up time of 7.7 years.
R	With 32-40 working hours a week as reference , the RRs for all-cause mortality were 0.75 ( 95% CI: 0.66-0.85 ) for 41-48 and 0.92 ( 0.80-1.05 ) for > 48 h.
C	Mortality rates in Denmark are significantly lower among employees with moderately long work weeks than they are among full-time employees without overtime work.
P	This study tested an assumption of the Natural Referent Vowel ( Polka & Bohn , 2011 ) framework , namely , that directional asymmetries in adult vowel perception can be influenced by language experience.
M	Data from participants reported in Escudero and Williams ( 2014 ) were analyzed.
M	Spanish participants categorized the Dutch vowels /a:/ and /alpha/ in 2 separate sessions: before and after vowel distributional training.
M	Sessions were 12 months apart.
M	Categorization was assessed using the XAB task , where on each trial participants heard 3 sounds sequentially ( first X , then A , then B ) and had to decide whether X was more similar to A or B.
R	Before training , participants exhibited a directional asymmetry in line with the prediction of Natural Referent Vowel.
R	Specifically , Spanish listeners performed worse when the vowel change from X to A was a change from peripheral to central vowel ( /alpha/ to /a:/ ).
R	However , this asymmetry was maintained 12 months later , even though distributional training improved vowel categorization performance.
C	Improvements in adult nonnative vowel categorization accuracy are not explained by attenuation of directional asymmetries.
C	Directional asymmetries in vowel perception are altered during native language acquisition , but may possibly be impervious to nonnative language experiences in adulthood.
B	In clinical practice Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) is a challenge for diagnostic and therapeutic effort due to a number of co-morbidities , e.g. , depression , anxiety disorders , Tourette Syndrome and impulsive aggression that can be a complication or a result of the core symptoms or evolve parallel to the basic disorder.
B	The therapeutic strategies incorporate a multimodal access with a combination of psychosocial , psychotherapeutic and medical measures.
B	The combination of various medical substances for an effective treatment of these co-morbidities , especially Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and atypical neuroleptics with psychostimulants has substantially reduced the occurrence of the main symptoms of the disorder in many cases and thus can also lead to a decrease in the occurrence of co-morbidities.
B	Where this strategy fails to suffice , it is recommended to consider medical treatment strategies in combination with other substances that alternatively or in combination with psychostimulants increasingly positively influence co-morbid symptoms.
B	Objective and method: Based on a Medline literature search we report the results of combined medical approaches for an effective medical treatment of the ADHD core symptoms accompanied by serious co-morbid symptoms.
B	Hereby we focused on the above cited disorders.
B	Combined treatment options that include psychostimulants are considered in particular.
B	Moreover , recommendations for medical treatment strategies oriented to the clinical cardinal symptoms are presented in the form of algorithms.
B	Evidence-based literature and practical experience are critically reviewed.
R	In most cases it will be sufficient to begin the treatment with a psychostimulant because co-morbid symptoms also will be significantly reduced.
R	However , if the latter are in the foreground of the clinical picture , antidepressants or neuroleptics are to be considered as primary or equivalent treatment options.
C	Since in Germany most of the substances discussed are not licensed for use in paediatric treatment , proofs of efficacy in children are lacking.
C	One also must reckon with the frequent occurrence of side effects.
C	Finally , little data exist on treatments that include the use of psychostimulants.
B	National survey data indicate the number of individuals reporting a disability is rising.
B	Those with disabilities experience a large number of barriers to health promotion and disease prevention programming.
B	However , only a limited number of studies have used nationally representative data to examine the health status of individuals with disabilities in comparison to those without disabilities.
B	Objective/
P	We used the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey ( MEPS ) to examine whether disability is associated with higher prevalence rates for common chronic diseases , lower use of preventive care and higher health care expenditures.
P	Our research hypothesis was that nationally , adults with either physical disability or cognitive limitations experience significant health disparities in comparison to those with no disability.
M	We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing the health of adults ( 18 and over ) with physical disabilities or cognitive limitations to individuals with no disability using data from the 2006 full year consolidated data file from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey ( MEPS ).
M	We used chi-squared tests , t-tests , and logistic regression to evaluate the association.
R	Individuals with physical disabilities or cognitive limitations had significantly higher prevalence rates for 7 chronic diseases than persons with no disabilities.
R	The disability groups were also significantly less likely than the no disability group to receive 3 types of preventive care.
C	These data suggest that adults with disabilities and chronic conditions receive significantly fewer preventive services and have poorer health status than individuals without disabilities who have the same health conditions.
C	This indicates a need for public health interventions that address the unique characteristics of adults with disabilities , many of whom are at risk for high cost , debilitating conditions that may not have as severe an effect on other population segments.

B	Although telomere shortening occurs as a natural part of aging , there is now a robust body of research that suggests that there is a relationship between psychosocial , environmental , and behavioral factors and changes in telomere length.
B	These factors need to be considered when integrating telomere measurement in biobehavioral research studies.
P	This article provides a brief summary of the known facts about telomere biology and an integrative review of current human research studies that assessed relationships between psychosocial , environmental , or behavioral factors and telomere length.
M	An integrative review was conducted to examine human research studies that focused on psychosocial , environmental , and behavioral factors affecting telomere length and telomerase activity using the electronic databases PubMed/Medline and CINAHL from 2003 to the present.
M	In addition to the known individual factors that are associated with telomere length , the results of the integrative review suggest that perceived stress , childhood adversities , major depressive disorder , educational attainment , physical activity , and sleep duration should also be measured.
C	Multiple factors have been shown to affect telomere length.
C	To advance understanding of the role of telomere length in health and disease risk , it will be important to further elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to telomere shortening.
B	This study aims to estimate the odds and predictors of Cannabis Use Disorders ( CUD ) relapse among individuals in remission.
M	Analyses were done on the subsample of individuals with lifetime history of a CUD ( abuse or dependence ) who were in full remission at baseline ( Wave 1 ) of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions ( NESARC ) ( n = 2350 ).
M	Univariate logistic regression models and hierarchical logistic regression model were implemented to estimate odds of relapse and identify predictors of relapse at 3 years follow up ( Wave 2 ).
R	The relapse rate of CUD was 6.63% over an average of 3.6 year follow-up period.
R	In the multivariable model , the odds of relapse were inversely related to time in remission , whereas having a history of conduct disorder or a major depressive disorder after Wave 1 increased the risk of relapse.
C	Our findings suggest that maintenance of remission is the most common outcome for individuals in remission from a CUD.
C	Treatment approaches may improve rates of sustained remission of individuals with CUD and conduct disorder or major depressive disorder.

B	Participating in civic activities has been found to be related to positive health outcomes.
P	This study examines associations between injection drug use health variables ( sharing paraphernalia , using shooting galleries ) and political/civic engagement ( identifying with any political party , attention paid to politics and being registered to vote ).
M	Participants ( N = 162 ) were recruited at 6 New York City ( NYC ) methadone programs as part of an HIV intervention ( 86% male ).
R	In the bivariate analysis , being registered to vote and political party identification were related to lower paraphernalia sharing ; higher levels of attention paid to politics were associated with lower shooting gallery use.
R	In the multivariate analysis , political party identification was associated with lower paraphernalia sharing and higher levels of attention paid to politics was related to lower shooting gallery use.
C	Findings suggest that maintaining connections with mainstream civic activities can be related to reduced health risks , including HIV risk behaviors.
C	This study contributes to understanding the relationships between involvement in civic/political participation and health , an area in which few studies have been conducted.
B	Sexual minority women ( SMW ; such as lesbian , bisexual , and mostly lesbian ) exhibit excess cardiometabolic risk , yet factors that contribute to cardiometabolic risk in this population are poorly understood.
B	Trauma exposure has been posited as a contributor to cardiometabolic risk in SMW.
M	An analysis of data from Wave 3 of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women Study was conducted.
M	Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of trauma.
M	Next , multiple logistic regression was used to examine the associations of different forms of trauma throughout the life course ( childhood , adulthood , and lifetime ) , with psychosocial and behavioral risk factors and self-reported cardiometabolic risk ( obesity , hypertension , and diabetes ) in SMW adjusted for relevant covariates.
R	A total of 547 participants were included.
R	Older age was associated with higher rates of childhood and adulthood trauma.
R	SMW of color reported higher rates of childhood trauma than white participants.
R	Higher education was associated with lower rates of adulthood trauma.
R	All forms of trauma were associated with probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and lower perceived social support.
R	Adult trauma was associated with anxiety , whereas childhood and lifetime trauma were associated with higher odds of depression.
R	No significant associations between forms of trauma and behavioral risk factors were noted , except that childhood trauma was associated with higher odds of past-3-month overeating.
R	Logistic regression models examining the association of trauma and cardiometabolic risk revealed that childhood trauma was an independent risk factor for diabetes.
R	Adulthood and lifetime trauma were significantly associated with obesity and hypertension.
C	Trauma emerged as an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic risk in SMW.
C	These findings suggest that clinicians should screen for trauma as a cardiovascular risk factor in SMW , with special attention to SMW most at risk.
B	Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus face several emotional and social consequences of their chronic illness in their everyday life.
B	Symptoms of distress and depression are prevalent.
B	For providing psychosocial self-management support , nurses in primary care were trained to identify patients with psychosocial problems during routine medically-shaped diabetes consultations.
B	However , detection rates appeared to be strikingly low.
P	Our study aimed to examine patients' readiness to discuss psychosocial problems with nurses during diabetes consultations.
M	A mixed methods design was used in which qualitative data collection was followed up by quantitative data collection.
M	Diabetes care in a regional group of family practices in the south of the Netherlands.
M	Type 2 diabetes patients with psychosocial problems , determined by a self-administered questionnaire.
M	First , in-depth interviews ( n=12 ) were conducted about patients' experiences with routine diabetes consultations and their perspective on a biopsychosocial care approach.
M	Based on a qualitative content analysis , a structured questionnaire was designed to further explore the findings among a larger group of patients.
M	This questionnaire was completed by 205 patients.
M	The questionnaire included 14 items measuring patients' agreement with statements about diabetes care and the role of the nurse to focus on patients' emotional and social functioning.
R	The interviews showed that patients view a diabetes consultation primarily as a biomedical check-up , and do not perceive discussion of psychosocial well-being as an integral part of diabetes management.
R	More than 90% of the sample showed a positive attitude towards current diabetes consultations.
R	Patients' intentions and perceived needs regarding a biopsychosocial care approach of the nurse were variable.
R	Younger patients seemed more open to discussing psychosocial problems with the nurse than patients over 65.
R	Patients' openness to discussing psychosocial problems was not significantly ( p < 0.05 ) associated with the nurses being trained in the biopsychosocial self-management approach.
C	Patients see primary care nurses primarily as specialists regarding the biomedical management of diabetes.
C	Although patients seemed to support the ideal of integrated care , they did not expect a discussion about psychosocial problems in diabetes consultations.
C	The incorporation of systematic detection of patients with psychosocial problems in diabetes care requires endeavours to make patients acquainted with the new role of the nurse.

B	Six major pharmaceutical products were withdrawn from the market from 2000 to 2006.
B	Little evidence exists in understanding consumer reactions to such events and the influence the withdrawal has on its competitors.
P	To explore consumers' attribution of blame after pharmaceutical product market withdrawal ( PPMW ) and its effect on trust.
M	Subjects were assigned randomly to 4 groups and provided a unique hypothetical PPMW scenario and asked to imagine themselves in the situation described.
M	Each scenario represented a different "distance" from the PPMW ( eg , whether subjects were asked to assume they were taking the withdrawn drug or a therapeutic substitute ).
M	Blame of and trust in several key professionals/groups were measured.
R	Closer "distance" to the PPMW resulted in higher blame attributions for the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , pharmaceutical company ( Pharma ) , and the physician.
R	Although the pattern of trust scores did not differ based on "distance ," insurance companies and Pharma suffered from low trust , whereas pharmacists and physicians received higher trust ratings.
R	Blaming appeared to be no different between consumers on a withdrawn product and those consumers on a product in the same therapeutic class ( "substitute" product ).
C	Substitute products ( drugs in the same therapeutic class ) appear to be affected in the event of a PPMW , although drugs used to treat the same disease do not appear to be so affected.
C	The difficult to-explain findings with respect to trust may be accounted for by the fact that trust is more downstream than blame ( based on the scenario presentations ) and that trust is a complex construct with multiple antecedents.
C	Although the bonds of interpersonal trust remain stronger than those of institutional trust , the likelihood of situational trust versus overall trust may complicate this picture of understanding trust.
C	It may be possible that trust is impervious to this one negative instance versus many positive interactions.

P	This article describes the federal accountability requirements related to young children with disabilities and the contribution of the speech-language pathologist ( SLP ) to provide these data through the use of authentic , functional assessments.
M	The article summarizes recent state and federal developments related to assessment for accountability and draws on the recommendations of national organizations , including the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association , to underscore the importance of high-quality assessment for guiding practice and for documenting child outcomes for accountability.
M	Clinical Implications/
C	The widespread use of recommended practices for assessment will provide children , families , and practitioners , including SLPs , with the highest quality assessment information , at the same time providing states and the federal government with much-needed valid data on child outcomes for accountability purposes.
B	Neuroimaging studies suggest that acute sleep deprivation can lead to adaptations , such as compensatory recruitment of cerebral structures , to maintain cognitive performance despite sleep loss.
B	However , the understanding of the neurochemical alterations related to these adaptations remains incomplete.
P	Investigate BDNF levels , cognitive performance and their relations in healthy subjects after acute sleep deprivation.
M	Nineteen sleep deprived ( 22.11 +/- 3.21 years ) and twenty control ( 25.10 +/- 4.42 years ) subjects completed depression , anxiety and sleep quality questionnaires.
M	Sleep deprived group spent a full night awake performing different playful activities to keep themselves from sleeping.
M	Attention , response inhibition capacity and working memory ( prefrontal cortex -dependent ) were assessed with Stroop and Digit Span tests.
M	Declarative memory ( hippocampus-dependent ) was assessed with Logical Memory test.
M	Serum BDNF was measured by sandwich ELISA.
M	Data were analyzed with independent samples T -test , ANOVA , ANCOVA and curve estimation regressions.
M	p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.
R	The sleep deprived group showed higher BDNF levels and normal performance on attention , response inhibition capacity and working memory.
R	However , declarative memory was impaired.
R	A sigmoidal relation between BDNF and Stroop Test scores was found.
C	Increased BDNF could be related , at least in part , to the maintenance of normal prefrontal cognitive functions after sleep deprivation.
C	This potential relation should be further investigated.

P	We examined the association of bilingual exposure with structural and pragmatic language development in Chinese children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ).
M	The parents of 54 children with ASD exposed to 1 ( n = 31 ) or 2 ( n = 23 ) Chinese languages completed ( a ) a questionnaire to evaluate their child's competence in structural language and pragmatic ability in their dominant language ( Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition ; Bishop , 2006 ) , and ( b ) a questionnaire to assess their child's social functioning ( Social Responsiveness Scale ; Constantino & Gruber , 2005 ; Wang , Lee , Chen , & Hsu , 2012 ).
M	In addition , parents completed thorough interviews regarding the linguistic environment of their children ( Language Environment Interview ; Hambly & Fombonne , 2011 ).
R	Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that bilingually exposed children with ASD did not demonstrate significantly different performance on any standard measure relative to their monolingual peers.
C	The findings suggest that bilingual language exposure is not associated with additional challenges for the development of the dominant language in children with ASD.
C	The lack of negative associations in our sample is not likely to be due to the comparatively early diagnosis and/or intervention that are available in other countries.
C	We discuss implications for decisions regarding the linguistic environment of children with ASD.
P	Communication problems are a major contributing factor to adverse events in hospitals.
P	The contextual environment in small rural hospitals increases the importance of emergency department ( ED ) patient transfer communication quality.
P	This study addresses the communication problems through the development and testing of ED quality measurement of interfacility patient transfer communication.
M	Input from existing measures , measurement and health care delivery experts , as well as hospital frontline staff was used to design and modify ED quality measures.
M	Three field tests were conducted to determine the feasibility of data collection and the effectiveness of different training methods and types of partnerships.
M	Measures were evaluated based on their prevalence , ease of data collection , and usefulness for internal and external improvement.
R	It is feasible to collect ED quality measure data.
R	Different data sources , data collection , and data entry methods , training and partners can be used to examine hospital ED quality.
R	There is significant room for improvement in the communication of patient information between health care facilities.
C	Current health care reform efforts highlight the importance of clear communication between organizations held accountable for patient safety and outcomes.
C	The patient transfer communication measures have been tested in a wide range of rural settings and have been vetted nationally.
C	They have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum , are included in the National Quality Measurement Clearinghouse supported by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , and are under consideration by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for future payment determinations beginning in calendar year 2013.
B	Alcohol use is a key risk factor for young adult mortality and disease , but limited research has focused on high-risk alcohol use among individuals moving from early young adulthood into building and maintaining an initial structure of adult life.
B	This study estimated the prevalence of a range of alcohol use behaviors among US young adults aged 25/26 , examined evidence for historical change in prevalence rates , and estimated associations between alcohol use and key demographic , substance use , and adult social role characteristics.
M	Data were obtained from 3542 individuals selected for follow-up from the nationally representative 12th-grade student Monitoring the Future study.
M	Respondents self-reported alcohol use behaviors at age 25/26 during calendar years 2005-2014.
R	Two fifths ( 39.9% ) of young adults aged 25/26 reported being intoxicated at least once in the past 30 days ; 25.6% reported usually experiencing a sustained high of 3 or more hours when drinking alcohol.
R	Past-2-week binge drinking ( 5+ drinks in a row ) was reported by 36.3% of respondents.
R	Past-2-week high-intensity drinking ( 10+ drinks in a row ) was reported by 12.4%.
R	These age 25/26 alcohol use prevalence rates remained stable over the 10years of data examined , in contrast to significant declines over historical time in alcohol prevalence rates among these same individuals at age 18.
R	High-risk drinking was particularly associated with being male , white , unmarried , employed , a nonparent , and an alcohol user before finishing high school.
C	Among US young adults in their mid-20s , alcohol use was highly normative and frequently included participation in high-risk drinking behaviors.
C	High-risk alcohol use prevention approaches developed specifically to reach young adults in their mid-20s are needed , as well as efforts to increase proactive clinician screening to identify young adults participating in high-risk alcohol use.
B	Despite demonstrating basic vehicle operations skills sufficient to pass a state licensing test , novice teen drivers demonstrate several deficits in tactical driving skills during the first several months of independent driving.
B	Improving our knowledge of the types of errors made by teen permit holders early in the learning process would assist in the development of novel approaches to driver training and resources for parent supervision.
M	The purpose of the current analysis was to describe driving performance errors made by teens during the permit period , and to determine if there were differences in the frequency and type of errors made by teens: ( 1 ) in comparison to licensed , safe , and experienced adult drivers ; ( 2 ) by teen and parent-supervisor characteristics ; and ( 3 ) by teen-reported quantity of practice driving.
M	Data for this analysis were combined from two studies: ( I ) the control group of teens in a randomized clinical trial evaluating an intervention to improve parent-supervised practice driving ( n = 89 parent-teen dyads ) and ( 2 ) a sample of 37 adult drivers ( mean age 44.2 years ) , recruited and screened as an experienced and competent reference standard in a validation study of an on-road driving assessment for teens ( tODA ).
M	Three measures of performance: drive termination ( i.e. , the assessment was discontinued for safety reasons ) , safety-relevant critical errors , and vehicle operation errors were evaluated at the approximate mid-point ( 12 weeks ) and end ( 24 weeks ) of the learner phase.
M	Differences in driver performance were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Pearson's Chi-square test for categorical variables.
R	10.4% of teens had their early assessment terminated for safety reasons and 15.4% had their late assessment terminated , compared to no adults.
R	These teens reported substantially fewer behind the wheel practice hours compared with teens that did not have their assessments terminated: tODA( early ) ( 9.0 vs. 20.0 , p < 0.001 ) and tODA( late ) ( 19.0 vs. 58.3 ,p < 0.001 ).
R	With respect to critical driving errors , 55% of teens committed a total of 85 critical errors ( range of 1-5 errors per driver ) on the early tODA ; by comparison , only one adult committed a critical error ( p < 0.001 ).
R	On the late tODA , 54% of teens committed 67 critical errors ( range of 1-8 errors per driver ) compared with only one adult ( p < 0.001 ).
R	No differences in teen or parent gender , parent/teen relationship type or parent prior experience teaching a teen to drive were observed between teens who committed a critical error on either route and teens that committed no critical errors.
R	A borderline association between median teen-reported practice quantity and critical error commission was observed for the late tODA.
R	The overall median proportion of vehicle operation errors for teens was higher than that of adults on both assessments , though median error proportions were less than 10% for both teens and adults.
C	In comparison to a group of experienced adult drivers , a substantially higher proportion of learner teens committed safety-relevant critical driving errors at both time points of assessment.
C	These findings , as well as the associations between practice quantity and the driving performance outcomes studied suggest that further research is needed to better understand how teens might effectively learn skills necessary for safe independent driving while they are still under supervised conditions.

B	Identity negotiations of people living with cancer have been shown to be significant psychosocial challenges throughout cancer trajectories but have not been adequately explored among young adults with cancer.
B	Narrative approaches might help to reveal moments of ( dis ) empowerment that affect their identity negotiations.
P	The aim of this study is to explore how young adults speak to their identities in relation to their narratives of having cancer and receiving care.
M	A total of 21 young adults ( 18-45 years old ) provided cancer narratives through semistructured life history interviews.
M	Thematic narrative analysis was used to determine how participants represented themselves in their stories.
R	Participants used a wide diversity of identities well beyond those most familiar in dominant discourses ( eg , patients , survivors , and fighters ) , and their identities frequently changed at significant "turning points'' in their narratives , especially in relation to good and bad experiences of care.
C	Cancer-related identities often undergo personal and social negotiation over time , and not just among young adults still feeling the effects of treatment.
C	Psychosocial oncology could take further steps toward incorporating this fluidity and multiplicity within the discipline's discourses of identity.
C	The identities gathered here may contribute to a more comprehensive toolkit of narrative resources for empowering young adults ( and others ) with cancer , serving as a starting point for negotiating identities with their care providers.
C	Our findings raise questions about which identities should be fostered and how healthcare professionals might be ( unknowingly ) involved in patients' identity negotiations.
B	China has made great progress in improving hospital delivery-the coverage of hospital delivery has increased to above 95% in most regions-some regions lag behind owing to geographic and economic inequality , particularly the poor ethnic minority areas of the Sichuan Province.
B	This study explores factors which may influence hospital delivery from multiple perspectives , with implications for practice and policy.
M	A framework analysis approach was used to identify and categorize the main barriers and levers to hospital delivery.
M	Our analysis draws on basic information from the sampled counties ( Butuo and Daofu ).
R	The hospital delivery rate was below 50% in the two sampled areas.
R	In both areas , the "New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme" and "Rural hospital delivery subsidy" were introduced , but only Butuo county had a transportation subsidy policy.
R	Socioeconomically disadvantaged women in both counties who delivered their babies in hospitals could also apply for financial assistance.
R	A lack of transport was among the main reasons for low hospital delivery rates in these two counties.
R	Furthermore , while the hospital delivery costs could be mostly covered by "New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme" or "Rural Hospital Delivery Subsidy" , reimbursement was not guaranteed.
R	People in Daofu county might be affected by their Buddhism religion for hospital delivery.
R	Women in Butuo following the Animism religion would refuse delivery in hospitals because of language barriers.
R	Traditional lay beliefs were the main factor that influenced hospital delivery ; their understandings of reproductive health varied , and many believed that childbirth should not be watched by strangers and that a home delivery was safe.
C	This study has highlighted a number of barriers and levers to hospital delivery in rural poor ethnic minority areas which could inform and improve the access and rate of hospital delivery rate ; thereby reducing health inequalities in maternal and child health in China.
B	The modifiable factors associated with blood pressure variability ( BPV ) are still being established and their clinical relevance is poorly understood.
B	Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD )rand depression have been implicated with higher BPV in the short term ( e.g. hours , days ) however their effects on BPV over longer periods are unknown.
M	In a prospective cohort study , 1454 elderly participants ( age 78.5 +/- 3.78 years , 59% women ) underwent structured interview for GAD and major depression.
M	Participants performed home blood pressure monitoring ( HBPM ) over 3 consecutive days and underwent serial clinic BP measures on 4 separate follow-ups over an 8 year period.
M	Systolic and diastolic BPV was calculated using the coefficient of variation ( CV ) and standard deviation method.
M	Generalized linear models assessed the association between GAD and depression with BPV over an 8 year period.
R	GAD was associated with significantly increased systolic BPV over 8 years in age , sex and mean systolic BP ( beta = 0.25 , SE = 0.09 ; p = 0.007 ) and fully adjusted models ( beta = 0.23 , SE = 0.10 ; p = 0.017 ).
R	BPV from HBPM was strongly associated with 8 year systolic BPV in age-sex ( beta = 3.10 , SE = 0.82 ; p < 0.001 ) and fully adjusted models ( beta = 3.09 , SE = 0.84 ; p < 0.001 ).
R	The association between GAD and longer term BPV was consistent when analyzing morning and evening HBPM measures of BPV.
R	There was no association between diastolic BPV over 8 years with GAD or depression.
C	GAD but not depression was associated with increased systolic BPV over an 8 year period controlling for HBPM.
C	GAD has clinical relevance for control of systolic BPV in elderly participants.

B	Individuals with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) are at an increased risk for inactivity-related diseases such as heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and obesity.
B	According to protection motivation theory , perceptions of disease risk predict motivation to engage in health-protective behaviors such as leisure time physical activity ( LTPA ).
P	The purposes of this study were to ( 1 ) examine changes in perceived risk for disease following an individualized health information intervention and ( 2 ) examine changes in perceived risk for disease as a predictor of changes in LTPA.
M	Perceived risk for disease and LTPA were measured at baseline among 62 people with SCI.
M	Objective disease risk information ( e.g. , waist circumference , BMI , blood glucose ) was collected and individual risk information was mailed to each participant.
M	Perceived risk for disease and LTPA were remeasured 1 and 2 weeks following receipt of individualized information , respectively.
R	Changes in perceived risk of heart disease and obesity were dependent on objective risk status.
R	There were no significant changes in perceived risk of diabetes.
R	Changes in perceived risk of heart disease negatively predicted , while changes in perceived risk of diabetes positively predicted , changes in LTPA.
R	Changes in obesity did not significantly predict changes in LTPA.
C	Among people with SCI , individual health:risk information can change perceptions of disease risk.
C	Increased perceived risk of diabetes may motivate LTPA , while increased perceived risk of heart disease may encourage avoidance behavior regarding LTPA.

B	Falling among adults in acute care is an important problem with falls rates in tertiary hospitals ranging from 2% to 5%.
B	Factors that increase the risk of falling , such as advanced age , altered mental status , medications that act on the central nervous system and poor mobility , often characterise individuals who survive a prolonged intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission.
P	To measure the incidence of falls and describe the characteristics of falters among intensive care survivors.
M	A comprehensive retrospective chart review was undertaken of 190 adults who were intubated and ventilated for >= 168h and survived their acute care stay.
M	Using a standardised form , several variables were extracted including falls during hospitalisation and risk factors such as age , severity of illness , and length of stay in intensive care and hospital.
R	Thirty-two ( 17% , 95% confidence interval 11.5-22.2% ) patients fell at least once on the in-patient wards following their ICU stay.
R	Compared with non-falters , falters were younger ( 53.2 +/- 17.9 vs. 44.1 +/- 18.3 years ; p = 0.009 ) and had a shorter duration of inotropic support in ICU ( 84 +/- 112 vs. 56 +/- 100 h ; p = 0.040 ).
R	The majority of falters were aged less than 65 years ( 84% ).
R	Both falters and non-fallers had similar APACHE II scores ( 20 +/- 8 vs. 21 +/- 7 ; p = 0.673 ) , length of stay in intensive care ( 14.2 +/- 8.7 vs. 14.0 +/- 9.7 days ; p = 0.667 ) and hospital length of stay ( 43.9 +/- 33.1 vs. 41.0 +/- 38.8 days ; p = 0.533 ).
C	Falling during hospitalisation is common in intensive care survivors.
C	Compared with non-fallers , falters were younger and required inotropes for a shorter duration.
C	Those who survive a prolonged admission to an ICU may benefit from specific assessment of balance and falls risk by the multidisciplinary team.

B	Sports concussion headache ( SCH ) is common ; yet poorly researched and understood.
B	Somatic complaints including headache are frequently reported by both amateur and professional athletes.
B	Although the literature is replete with reports of a high incidence of headache following sports concussive injuries , there is a dearth of evidence-based medicine to provide practitioners with an understanding of sports concussion headache risk factors , epidemiology , biomechanical risk factors and/or injury thresholds , aetiology , assessment , treatment or prognosis.
B	Review: This article will provide readers with an overview of SCH based on the available literature ( which as noted is limited ) ; and , where evidence is lacking , information will be provided from the more general post-traumatic headache ( PTHA ) literature , the author's extensive clinical experience and literature from parallel primary headache disorders.
B	Incidence , pathoanatomy , neurobiology , classification , natural history and prognosis of sports concussion headache will be reviewed.
B	Common , as well as less common , sports concussion headache subtypes will be discussed.
B	General approaches to evaluation ( including history taking and physical examination ) , as well as treatment approaches will also be addressed for specific headache subtypes.
B	Lastly , directions for future research will be explored.
B	Over the past decades , advances in neonatal care have led to substantial increases in survival among preterm infants.
B	With these gains , recent concerns have focused on increases in neurodevelopment morbidity related to the interplay between stressful early life experiences and the immature neuroimmune systems.
B	This interplay between these complex mechanisms is often described as the brain-gut signaling system.
B	The role of the gut microbiome and the brain-gut signaling system have been found to be remarkably related to both short-and long-term stress and health.
B	Recent evidence supports that microbial species , ligands , and/or products within the developing intestine play a key role in early programming of the central nervous system and regulation of the intestinal innate immunity.
P	The purpose of this state-of-the-science review is to explore the supporting evidence demonstrating the importance of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in regulation of early life experience.
P	We also discuss the role of gut microbiome in modulating stress and pain responses in high-risk infants.
P	A conceptual framework has been developed to illustrate the regulation mechanisms involved in early life experience.
C	The science in this area is just beginning to be uncovered ; having a fundamental understanding of these relationships will be important as new discoveries continue to change our thinking , leading potentially to changes in practice and targeted interventions.
P	As suburbs have grown , become more racially diverse , and become denser in recent years , the planning and design of suburban development has been fundamentally transformed.
P	Is urban design influencing contemporary suburban form , and does this have implications for public policy?
P	This article examines how certain urban design ideas , images , and values , that I call city sense because they previously influenced the planning and design of cities rather than suburbs , are now influencing suburban design.
M	I surveyed and interviewed senior planners in Southern California suburbs , asking them to compare urban design values and physical design elements in both innovative and typical development and redevelopment projects in their municipalities.
C	I find considerable agreement among planners that innovative projects are more likely than typical projects to introduce city sense into suburban design and to have a positive impact on suburban form.
C	The surveyed planners believe that innovative projects contribute most significantly to improving visual quality and sense of place , and least significantly to addressing inequities.
C	Takeaway for practice: Planners' views on innovative projects in Southern California indicate that they use urban design values and physical design elements to address some of the problems of growing metropolitan regions , and these design values and elements have potential to influence suburbs positively.
C	Research support: This research was supported by a grant from the University of California , Irvine , Academic Senate Council on Research , Computing , and Library Resources ; a grant from the American Planning Association Urban Design and Preservation Division ; and by a faculty fellowship from the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation.
B	Although the significant scientific advances on place attachment literature , no instruments exist specifically developed or adapted to residential care.
M	410 adolescents ( 11 - 18 years old ) participated in this study.
M	The place attachment scale evaluates five dimensions: Place identity , Place dependence , Institutional bonding , Caregivers bonding and Friend bonding.
M	Data analysis included descriptive statistics , content validity , construct validity ( Confirmatory Factor Analysis ) , concurrent validity with correlations with satisfaction with life and with institution , and reliability evidences.
M	The relationship with individual characteristics and placement length was also verified.
R	Content validity analysis revealed that more than half of the panellists perceive all the items as relevant to assess the construct in residential care.
R	The structure with five dimensions revealed good fit statistics and concurrent validity evidences were found , with significant correlations with satisfaction with life and with the institution.
R	Acceptable values of internal consistence and specific gender differences were found.
C	The preliminary psychometric properties of this scale suggest it potential to be used with youth in care.
B	Multiproblem families are multi-users of psychosocial and health care services , but little is known about factors associated with their care utilization in the general population.
B	The aim of this study was to assess which factors were associated with the overall and psychosocial care use of two members-i.e. , child and parent of each multiproblem family.
M	During well-child visits or psychosocial care , we identified 354 children and their parents who had problems in several life domains ( response 69.1% ).
M	We used multivariate stepwise backward logistic regression analyses to identify the factors related to their use of overall and psychosocial care.
R	A child's overall care use was associated with greater social support from family and friends ( odds ratio , OR , 95% confidence interval , CI ; OR = 1.05 , CI = 1.01-1.08 ) compared to less perceived social support ; and with more psychosocial problems in the child ( OR = 1.84 , CI = 1.04-3.24 ).
R	Child's psychosocial care use was more likely among older children ( OR = 1.94 , CI = 1.20-3.15 ) ; greater social support by family and friend ( OR = 1.03 , CI = 1.00-1.06 ) ; more psychosocial problems ( OR = 1.75 , CI = 1.04-2.97 ) ; and when there were more parenting concerns ( OR = 1.19 , CI = 1.06-1.33 ).
R	Parental overall and psychosocial care use was more likely when the family experienced a higher number of life events ( OR = 1.27 , CI = 1.17-1.38 , and OR = 1.39 , CI = 1.25-1.55 ).
C	Care use in multiproblem families is related to family factors as well as psychosocial problems.
C	It may be possible to use these family risk factors to identify such families early , whose intensive care use is possibly explained by the relationship with inadequate use of social support.
B	Following a situation appraisal in 2001 , a six year mental health reform programme ( Egymen ) 2002-7 was initiated by an Egyptian-Finnish bilateral aid project at the request of a former Egyptian minister of health , and the work was incorporated directly into the Ministry of Health and Population from 2007 onwards.
B	This paper describes the aims , methodology and implementation of the mental health reforms and mental health policy in Egypt 2002-2009.
M	A multi-faceted and comprehensive programme which combined situation appraisal to inform planning ; establishment of a health sector system for coordination , supervision and training of each level ( national , governorate , district and primary care ) ; development workshops ; production of toolkits , development of guidelines and standards ; encouragement of intersectoral liaison at each level ; integration of mental health into health management systems ; and dedicated efforts to improve forensic services , rehabilitation services , and child psychiatry services.
R	The project has achieved detailed situation appraisal , epidemiological needs assessment , inclusion of mental health into the health sector reform plans , and into the National Package of Essential Health Interventions , mental health masterplan ( policy guidelines ) to accompany the general health policy , updated Egyptian mental health legislation , Code of Practice , adaptation of the WHO primary care guidelines , primary care training , construction of a quality system of roles and responsibilities , availability of medicines at primary care level , public education about mental health , and a research programme to inform future developments.
R	Intersectoral liaison with education , social welfare , police and prisons at national level is underway , but has not yet been established for governorate and district levels , nor mental health training for police , prison staff and teachers.
C	The bilateral collaboration programme initiated a reform programme which has been sustained beyond the end of the funding.
C	The project has demonstrated the importance of using a multi-faceted and comprehensive programme to promote sustainable system change , key elements of which include a focus on the use of rapid appropriate treatment at primary care level , strengthening the referral system , interministerial and intersectoral liaison , rehabilitation , and media work to mobilize community engagement.
P	The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether conventional anthropometric databases of the U. S. general population are applicable to the population of U. S. electric utility field-workers.
B	On the basis of anecdotal observations , field-workers for electric power utilities were thought to be generally taller and larger than the general population.
B	However , there were no anthropometric data available on this population , and it was not known whether the conventional anthropometric databases could be used to design for this population.
M	For this study , 3 standing and 11 sitting anthropometric measurements were taken from 187 male field-workers from three electric power utilities located in the upper Midwest of the United States and Southern California.
M	The mean and percentile anthropometric data from field-workers were compared with seven well-known conventional anthropometric databases for North American males ( United States , Canada , and Mexico ).
R	In general , the male field-workers were taller and heavier than the people in the reference databases for U.S. males.
R	The field-workers were up to 2.3 cm taller and 10 kg to 18 kg heavier than the averages of the reference databases.
C	This study was justified , as it showed that the conventional anthropometric databases of the general population underestimated the size of electric utility field-workers , particularly with respect to weight.
C	When designing vehicles and tools for electric utility field-workers , designers and ergonomists should consider the population being designed for and the data from this study to maximize safety , minimize risk of injuries , and optimize performance.
B	Group prenatal care is a promising strategy to improve perinatal outcomes.
B	Research in larger more diverse populations with attention to adherence is needed to inform clinical practice recommendations.
B	We examined the impact of group prenatal care on preterm birth and low birth weight in a large metropolitan hospital , accounting for patient adherence , over an 8.5-year period.
M	We analyzed data from 9 ,348 pregnant women with a live , singleton birth who received group ( CenteringPregnancy or Expect With Me ) or individual prenatal care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from January 2009 through June 2016.
M	Propensity scores were used for matching based on year of delivery , age , race , pregnancy risk , and adequacy of care.
M	The propensity score matched sample included 1 ,384 group and 5 ,055 individual prenatal care patients ( total=6 ,439 women ).
M	Preterm birth ( <37 weeks gestation ) and low birth weight ( <2 ,500g ) were obtained from systematic medical review.
M	Risks were estimated using Poisson regression.
R	Controlling for individual visits , receiving group prenatal care resulted in significantly lower risk of having a preterm birth ( Rate ratio [RR] 0.63 , 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.81 ) and low birth weight baby ( RR 0.62 , 95% CI 0.47-0.81 ) , compared to receiving individual care only.
R	Women with 5 group prenatal care visits experienced even greater benefits: 68% ( RR=0.32 ; 95% CI 0.22-0.45 ) and 66% ( RR=0.34 ; 95% CI 0.23-0.50 ) risk reduction in preterm birth and low birth weight , respectively.
C	Participation in group prenatal care may improve birth outcomes.
C	Efforts to promote adoption and sustainability of group prenatal care by health systems may be warranted.
B	To examine the influencing factors and predictors of early improvement in schizophrenia patients.
M	370 patients suffering from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were examined within a naturalistic multicenter study.
M	Early improvement was defined as a >= 30% PANSS total score reduction within the first two treatment weeks , response as a >= 50% improvement of the PANSS total score from admission to discharge and remission according to the consensus , remission criteria.
M	Baseline and course-related variables such as positive , negative and depressive symptoms , side effects , functioning and subjective well-being were examined regarding their explanatory value for early improvement.
R	46% of the patients were identified to be early improvers.
R	Of these , 77% became treatment responder at discharge and 74% achieved the consensus remission criteria.
R	Amongst others , early improvers were significantly more often first-episode patients ( p = 0.009 ) , with a significantly shorter duration of current episode ( p = 0.024 ) and a shorter duration of the illness ( p = 0.0094 ).
R	A higher PANSS positive subscore ( p = 0.0089 ) , a higher score in the Strauss-Carpenter-Prognostic Scale ( SCPS ) ( p < 0.0001 ) , less extrapyramidal side effects ( p = 0.0004 ) at admission and the development of less extrapyramidal side effects within the first two treatment weeks ( p = 0.0013 ) as well as a duration of current episode of <= 6 months ( p = 0.0373 ) were identified to be significant predictors of early improvement.
C	Early improvement is associated with less illness chronicity and seems to be independent of the type of antipsychotic and the antipsychotic dosage applied.
C	The SCPS was found to be a valuable tool to detect early improvers already at the initiation of antipsychotic treatment.

P	This article presents the development , implementation , and evaluation of a crew resource management ( CRM ) training program specifically designed for employees within the automotive industry.
B	The central objective of this training program was to improve communication , teamwork , and stress management skills as well to increase the workers' situational awareness of potential errors that can occur during the production process.
M	Participants in the training program of this study were 80 employees , all of whom were working in a production unit for gearbox manufacturing.
M	Effectiveness of the CRM training course was evaluated two times ( 1 month and 6 months after the training program ).
R	The results showed a significant improvement in a wide range of CRM-relevant categories , especially in teamwork-related attitudes , in addition to an increase in the workers' situational awareness after the training program.
C	On the basis of the results , it can be stated that CRM training , which was originally developed for the aviation industry , can be transferred to the automotive industry.
C	However , because of the lack of behavioral observations , these effects are limited to CRM attitudes and knowledge changes.
C	Several recommendations for future research and training development in the field of human factors training are made.
B	There are wide-ranging differences in human growth , not only between ethnic groups but also between regions.
B	China covers a vast area and has a very large population.
B	However , no studies on the differences in development among children and adolescents in eastern and western China have been reported.
P	This study assessed the differences in stature and body weight in children and adolescents in eastern and western China.
M	Using data derived from two national surveys on students' constitution and health carried out by the Chinese government in 1985 and 2005 , the average stature and body weight for children and adolescents aged 7-18 years in eastern and western China were calculated.
M	The differences of mean values between eastern and western China were compared.
R	Boys and girls in eastern China were taller and heavier than their counterparts in western China in all age groups ( 7-18 years ) in 2005 , the average differences being 3.56 cm , 4.56 kg ( urban boys ) , 3.05 cm , 2.92 kg ( urban girls ) , 4.04 cm , 4.19 kg ( rural boys ) and 3.48 cm , 2.96 kg ( rural girls ).
R	In 18-year-old groups , the differences in the stature and body weight between eastern and western China were 2.82 cm , 5.17 kg for urban boys , 1.86 cm , 2.11 kg for urban girls , 2.26 cm , 3.38 kg for rural boys and 1.96 cm , 1.38 kg for rural girls , respectively.
R	From 1985 to 2005 , differences in stature and body weight of children and adolescents between eastern and western China have continuously expanded.
C	There have been obvious regional variations in development in children and adolescents in China , the variations in development in children and adolescents between eastern and western China being related to regional economic status and living standards of residents.
B	Studies have reported tracking of blood pressure ( BP ) from childhood to adulthood but with inconsistent results mainly due to methodological and ethnic differences.
B	We aimed to examine BP tracking during a 7-year period in a Greek cohort.
M	This is a longitudinal school-based study conducted during 1990-96 in Athens , Greece.
M	Children underwent BP and anthropometric measurements on two to three visits annually ( averaged to annual values ) for 7 years.
R	A total of 166 children with complete yearly follow-up data for the examined period were included ( mean baseline age 9 +/- 1.7 years , range: 5-12 years , 89 boys ).
R	At baseline , the prevalence of pre- and hypertension was 22.9 and 24.1% respectively and at the end of the follow-up 24.1% ( P = NS vs. baseline ) and 13.3% ( P = 0.02 vs. baseline ) respectively.
R	Systolic/diastolic BP tracking correlation coefficients between 1990 and 1996 were 0.38 ( P < 0.001 )/0.20 ( P = 0.06 ) for boys and 0.30 ( P = 0.007 )/0.22 ( P = 0.06 ) for girls.
R	Among children with baseline BP epsilon 90th centile ( systolic and/or diastolic ) , 44% remained in the same BP range after 7 years.
R	In stepwise multiple regression analysis , baseline systolic BP , male gender , baseline body mass index ( BMI ) and change in BMI from baseline to the end of the follow-up ( delta BMI ) were significant predictors of systolic BP levels at the end of the follow-up.
R	Baseline diastolic BP , baseline BMI and delta BMI were significant predictors of diastolic BP at the end of the follow-up.
C	These data suggest that the risk of developing high BP during adolescence can be predicted by BP and BMI at childhood.
B	Much of a General Practitioner's ( GP ) workload consists of managing patients with medically unexplained symptoms ( MUS ).
B	GP trainees are often taking responsibility for looking after people with MUS for the first time and so are well placed to reflect on this and the preparation they have had for it ; their views have not been documented in detail in the literature.
B	This study aimed to explore GP trainees' clinical and educational experiences of managing people presenting with MUS.
M	A mixed methods approach was adopted.
M	All trainees from four London GP vocational training schemes were invited to take part in a questionnaire and in-depth semi-structured interviews.
M	The questionnaire explored educational and clinical experiences and attitudes towards MUS using Likert scales and free text responses.
M	The interviews explored the origins of these views and experiences in more detail and documented ideas about optimising training about MUS.
M	Interviews were analysed using the framework analysis approach.
R	Eighty questionnaires out of 120 ( 67 % ) were returned and a purposive sample of 15 trainees interviewed.
R	Results suggested most trainees struggled to manage the uncertainty inherent in MUS consultations , feeling they often over-investigated or referred for their own reassurance.
R	They described difficulty in broaching possible psychological aspects and/or providing appropriate explanations to patients for their symptoms.
R	They thought that more preparation was needed throughout their training.
R	Some had more positive experiences and found such consultations rewarding , usually after several consultations and developing a relationship with the patient.
C	Managing MUS is a common problem for GP trainees and results in a disproportionate amount of anxiety , frustration and uncertainty.
C	Their training needs to better reflect their clinical experience to prepare them for managing such scenarios , which should also improve patient care.
P	Adolescent substance use has numerous consequences.
P	Our goals in this article are to compare the prevalence and correlates of substance use among ethnically diverse adolescents.
M	Data were from 2 ,332 adolescents aged 15-19 years recruited via respondent-driven sampling from disadvantaged settings in five cities.
M	Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify correlates of current substance use.
R	About half of the respondents were male.
R	Most adolescents ( 73.4% ) were currently enrolled in school and identified a father ( 86.2% ) and mother ( 98.6% ) figure and strong peer support.
R	Sixty-two percent reported lifetime use of at least one substance.
R	Overall , the most common substances ever used were alcohol ( 44.6% ) , cigarettes ( 26.2% ) , and marijuana ( 17.9% ).
R	Mean age at first use of alcohol was 14.2 +/- 3.1 years.
R	Current alcohol use was highest in Johannesburg ( 47.4% ) and lowest in Delhi ( 2.1% ).
R	The mean age at first use of cigarettes was 14.4 +/- 2.8 years.
R	Current cigarette smoking was highest in Johannesburg ( 32.5% ) and lowest in Delhi ( 3.7% ).
R	Male gender predicted current alcohol use in all sites , older age ( 17-19 years ) was also a predictor in Baltimore.
R	Male gender ( Johannesburg and Shanghai ) , older age ( Baltimore and Shanghai ) , and being out of school ( Baltimore , Johannesburg , and Shanghai ) predicted current cigarette smoking.
R	Absence of a caring father figure was predictive for current alcohol use in Baltimore and Shanghai.
R	Stronger peer support predicted alcohol ( Johannesburg and Shanghai ) and cigarette use ( Johannesburg ).
C	Substance use is still a major issue among adolescents around the world , underscoring the need for continued research and interventions.

B	perineal suturing is a common event which affects women across a variety of international settings.
B	Women have expressed pain related to perineal trauma in the postnatal period but little is known about pain during suturing.
B	In addition , there is a lack of evidence to identify how professional decisions are made about pain management during the suturing process.
P	to explore women and clinician's response to pain during the suturing of second degree tears and episiotomies.
M	mixed method feasibility study which included observation , questionnaires and interviews.
M	a Hospital Trust in Northwest England.
M	40 women and 21 clinicians participated.
M	mild , moderate and severe pain was measured via the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form ( MCPQ-SF ).
M	Psychological distress was identified via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ).
M	Semi-structured face to face interviews identified three themes , Psychological distress and future functioning ; Variation in practice and Style of communication.
R	women who experienced psychological distress during previous or current childbirth scored higher on HADS and MCPQ-SF , and appeared to express more concerns about future functioning and healing.
R	Variation in practice exists and style of communication had the potential to make the difference for women.
R	Implications for practice and research: the process of suturing is complex and is not a standalone event for a woman.
R	It is crucial that health professionals consider previous and subsequent experience of perineal suturing.
R	Future research aims to develop a decision tree to support pain management during suturing.

P	To examine the association between paid part-time employment among schoolchildren , and adult substance use , psychological well-being , and academic achievement.
M	Longitudinal data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study were used to evaluate the association between employment at each of 11 , 13 , and 15 years and adult smoking , regular alcohol binge drinking , regular cannabis use , sense of coherence , social participation , positive coping style , prosociality , no formal qualifications , and university degree.
M	Associations were initially assessed using unadjusted regression analyses and then adjusted for the potential childhood confounders intelligence quotient , reading development , Student's Perception of Ability Scale , socioeconomic disadvantage , family climate , harsh parent-child interaction , parental opinion of their child's attitude to school , and child's personal attitude to school.
R	Employment at 11 years of age was associated with a lower odds of adult smoking ; the odds of subsequent regular alcohol binge drinking were greater for those who were employed at age 13 ; and higher adult rates of social participation and prosociality were identified for adolescents who were employed at 15 years of age.
R	When the potential confounders were controlled , employment at age 13 was predictive of both adult smoking and regular binge drinking , and working at 15 years of age was protective against regular cannabis use and associated with greater social participation.
C	There is no consistent evidence that exposing schoolchildren to part-time employment compromised subsequent health , well-being , and education in a developed country.

B	It remains unclear regarding the contribution of each individual symptom in predicting the outcome in major depressive disorder ( MDD ).
B	The objective of this analysis was to evaluate trajectories of individual symptoms over time to identify which specific depressive item( s ) could predict subsequent clinical response.
M	The data of 2874 outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD who received citalopram for up to 14 weeks in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression ( STAR*D ) trial were analyzed.
M	Average trajectories of individual symptoms over time were estimated for remitters and non-remitters.
M	Moreover , specific symptoms whose improvement at week 2 predicted remission were identified , using binary logistic regression analysis.
R	Trajectories were significantly different between remitters and non-remitters in all depressive symptoms.
R	All depressive symptoms in the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology , Self-Report ( QIDS-SR16 ) in the two groups , except for hypersomnia and weight change in non-remitters , substantially improved within 2 weeks and gradually continued to improve thereafter throughout the 14 weeks.
R	Early improvements in the following five symptoms , in order of magnitude , in the QIDS-SR16 were significantly associated with remission: sad mood , negative self-view , feeling slowed down , low energy , and restlessness ( P<0001 , P<0.001 , P=0.001 , P=0.004 , P=0.021 ).
C	The participants were limited to the nonpsychotic MDD outpatients who received citalopram.
C	Further , symptomatology was not evaluated at the very beginning of treatment.
C	While the data pertain to citalopram and replication is necessary for other antidepressants , early improvements in certain core depressive symptoms may serve as a predictor of subsequent remission.

B	A resilient health system is inevitable in attaining the health-related Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ).
B	One way of strengthening health systems is improving the coverage of public health laws for better health governance.
B	The aim of this study is to describe the public health law situation in the Western Pacific Region and analyse the association of public health law coverage with health-related SDGs statistics.
B	Methods ; A total of 33 Western Pacific countries were selected and analysed using a multi-group ecological study design.
B	Public health law coverage was measured from April 2013 to October 2016 based on the public health law coverage module in the Tool to Assess Health Law' developed by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and Asian Institute for Bioethics and Health Law of Yonsei University.
B	The health-related SDGs status were examined using health statistics data from World Health Statistics 2017 and 2018 by WHO and SDGs index scores of previous research.
R	Countries with high public health law coverage were Vietnam , Republic of Korea , Hong Kong , and Singapore.
R	Low coverage countries were mainly Pacific Island countries.
R	High public health law coverage issues were health care organisation , communicable diseases , and substance abuse , whereas those of low coverage were human reproduction , family health , and oral health.
R	Public health law coverage was associated with health-related SDGs statistics such as life expectancy at birth ( r = 0.47 , p = 0.03 ) , health life expectancy at birth ( r = 0.47 , p = 0.04 ) , health-related SDGs index ( r = 0.43 , p = 0.05 ).
R	Among the SDG 3 indicators , maternal mortality ratio ( r = -0.53 , p = 0.01 ) , neonatal mortality rate ( r = -0.44 , p = 0.02 ) , new HIV infections ( r = 0.78 , p = 0.04 ) , total alcohol consumption ( r = 0.45 , p = 0.02 ) , adolescent birth rate ( r = -0.40 , p = 0.04 ) , UHC service coverage index ( r = 0.50 , p = 0.02 ) , and IHR average core capacity score ( r = 0.54 , p = 0.004 ) were statistically meaningful.
R	However , there was no association of public health law coverage with health statistics in other SDGs.
R	Conclusions ; This study proved the importance of public health law in supporting the attainment of health-related SDGs.
R	These results should be used as the basis for review and action at country level in improving public health law for better health systems , consequently achieving health-related SDGs.
B	The present study was the first attempt for determination and measurement of pesticide residues in tomatoes used in salad production plants in Isfahan , central Iran.
M	A multiresidue method based on modified QuEChERS ( quick , easy , cheap , effective , rugged and safe ) sample preparation , followed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) was developed and validated for the determination of 15 pesticides ( permethrin , primicarb , dichlorvos , diazinone , fenpropathrin , carbaryl , chlorpyrifos , malathion , chlortalonil , brompropilate , propargit , tetradifone , phosalone , iprodion and endosulfane ) from different classes.
M	The recovery yields ranged from 83.84 to 119.73% and the relative standard deviation ( RSD ) was below 20.54%.
M	The limits of detection ( LODs ) were between 1.63 to 10.5 mg/kg and the limits of quantifications ( LOQs ) were between 5.43 to 35 mg/kg.
M	The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of 22 tomato samples obtained from salad production plants in Isfahan in Sep to Dec 2014.
R	An amount of 31.81% of samples showed contamination above maximum residue levels ( MRLs ) with pesticides.
R	In addition , 13.6% of samples had contamination with diazinone and 18.18% of samples with chlorpyrifos.
C	A full consideration is essential for tomatoes used in salad and food productions.
C	It suggests a need for revision of the current trend of supervision for tomatoes and other vegetables presented in wholesale markets.
C	In all , the study confirms that pesticide residue determination in food products , especially in raw fruits and vegetables , is a very demanding task in public health safety and trade.
P	To compare the efficiency and accuracy of sampling designs including and excluding the sampling of individuals within sampled households in health surveys.
M	From a population survey conducted in Baixada Santista Metropolitan Area , SP , Southeastern Brazil , lowlands between 2006 and 2007 , 1 ,000 samples were drawn for each design and estimates for people aged 18 to 59 and 18 and over were calculated for each sample.
M	In the first design , 40 census tracts , 12 households per sector , and one person per household were sampled.
M	In the second , no sampling within the household was performed and 40 census sectors and 6 households for the 18 to 59-year old group and 5 or 6 for the 18 and over age group or more were sampled.
M	Precision and bias of proportion estimates for 11 indicators were assessed in the two final sets of the 1 ,000 selected samples with the two types of design.
M	They were compared by means of relative measurements: coefficient of variation , bias/mean ratio , bias/standard error ratio , and relative mean square error.
M	Comparison of costs contrasted basic cost per person , household cost , number of people , and households.
R	Bias was found to be negligible for both designs.
R	A lower precision was found in the design including individuals sampling within households , and the costs were higher.
C	The design excluding individual sampling achieved higher levels of efficiency and accuracy and , accordingly , should be first choice for investigators.
C	Sampling of household dwellers should be adopted when there are reasons related to the study subject that may lead to bias in individual responses if multiple dwellers answer the proposed questionnaire.
B	Overall , disparities exist in preventive health care services for people with disabilities compared with other Americans.
B	Little is known about the effects of caregiving on preventive services use.
B	This study examines caregiver characteristics and influence on the use of preventive services for people with disabilities.
M	The 2000-2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of 25 states included 5486 self-reported respondents with disabilities who were surveyed for preventive care use.
M	Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for demographic and functional status of these respondents.
R	Among the subset of the respondents with caregivers , those with paid caregivers were significantly more likely to receive an influenza vaccination ( adjusted odds ratio [OR] , 1.49 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] , 1.08-1.93 ).
R	Among those with a caregiver , those with a spouse/partner caregiver were also significantly more likely to receive an influenza vaccination ( adjusted OR , 1.33 ; 95% CI , 1.05-1.69 ) or PPV ( adjusted OR , 1.59 ; 95% CI , 1.41-2.38 ) compared with those with "other'' as their caregiver.
R	Women with disabilities with a spouse/partner caregiver were significantly more likely to have ever had a Pap test ( adjusted OR , 3.13 ; 95% CI , 1.41-6.67 ) or mammogram ( adjusted OR , 1.85 ; 95% CI , 1.23-2.70 ) than those with "other'' relative caregiver.
R	Those respondents who reported "rarely adequate'' caregiver satisfaction were significantly more likely to have self-reported ever having colon cancer screening compared with those with a usually adequate caregiver.
R	The majority of results did not show consistent evidence of caregiver benefit , and a fair number of the associations were not statistically significant.
C	The findings suggest that having a caregiver is not consistently associated with self-report of ever using preventive services.
C	However , this study suggests that caregiver characteristics are associated with preventive care for people with disabilities.
C	For influenza vaccination , our results showed that paid caregivers were more likely to provide preventive care to individuals with disability than a spouse or partner , which were more likely to provide more preventive care than those with "other'' caregiver.
C	Given the number of comparisons , we consider these results to be preliminary and require more confirmation in other population data.

B	Numerous public health organizations have adopted national physical activity recommendations.
B	Despite these recommendations , over half of the US population does not meet the minimum recommendation for physical activity , with large variations across individual US states.
M	Using the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) prevalence data for physical activity and obesity by state , we performed a weighted least squares regression using prevalence of obesity ( BMI >= 30 kg/m( 2 ) ) as the dependent variable and insufficiently physically active ( included completely sedentary ) , age , race , gender , and median household income as the independent variables.
R	The unadjusted weighted least squares regression revealed a strong correlation between a state's prevalence of obesity and the prevalence of insufficiently physically active ( R = .76 , R( 2 ) = .58 , P < .0001 ).
R	After adjusting for age , gender , race , and median household income , the prevalence of insufficiently physically active is still a significant predictor of the state prevalence of obesity ( partial R = .44 , R( 2 ) = .19 P = .004 ).
C	Macroenvironmental and socio-political disparities between individual US states that transcend simple state-level demographic factors need to be examined more rigorously to identify unique barriers and promoters of physical activity.
B	Some patients with schizophrenia suffer from continuous auditory hallucinations that are refractory to antipsychotic medications.
M	Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) was used to treat a 24-year-old female schizophrenia patient who had severe , clozapine-refractory , continuous , psychosocially and cognitively disabling auditory hallucinations.
M	The tDCS cathode was placed midway between T3 and P3 , and the anode over F3 , in the 10-20 electroencephalogram electrode positioning system.
R	Once daily , 20-minute tDCS sessions at 1-mA intensity produced noticeable improvement within a week: cognitive and psychosocial functioning improved , followed by attenuation in the experience of hallucinations.
R	There was greater than 90% self-reported improvement within 2 months.
R	Benefits accelerated when the current was raised to 3 mA ; treatment duration was increased to 30-minute sessions , and session frequency was increased to twice daily.
R	The patient improved from a psychosocially vegetative state to near-normal functioning.
R	Once-to twice-daily domiciliary tDCS was continued across nearly 3 years and is still ongoing.
R	Benefits attenuated or were even lost when alternate day session spacing was attempted , or when electrode positioning was changed ; benefits were regained when the original stimulation protocol was reintroduced.
R	There was confirmation of benefit in 2 separate on-off-on situations , which occurred inadvertently and under blinded conditions.
R	There were no adverse events attributable to tDCS.
C	This is the first report in literature of the safe and effective use of daily to twice-daily , domiciliary , 30-min , 1- to 3-mA tDCS sessions across nearly 3 years for the treatment of continuous , disabling , clozapine-refractory auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.
C	Key learning points emerging from this case are presented and discussed.
P	To explore the lived experiences of women with a recent history of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) who live in rural communities.
M	A phenomenological study exploring the lived experiences of 10 women aged 25 to 49 years with a history of GDM in the last 5 years.
M	Data were collected through two semistructured short interviews that were conducted in person or by telephone.
R	Five themes emerged: Authentic emotion , Judgment , It's only a matter of time , I can't do this alone , and Missed opportunities.
R	Strong emotions were experienced at the time of diagnosis.
R	Some women felt judged by healthcare professionals and others based on having GDM.
R	Some were concerned about future risk of developing Type 2 DM.
R	There is a lack of understanding of GDM by women at the time of diagnosis and after they give birth.
R	The majority of women in this study noted that healthcare professionals did not discuss future implications of Type 2 DM and the need for follow-up glucose testing.
R	Many opportunities are missed to provide education and support to facilitate lifestyle interventions.
C	Self-management of GDM is more likely to be successful if women understand GDM and believe that they can manage it.
C	Nurses should use every opportunity to provide women with GDM information and available resources.
C	This may be important in rural communities where fewer resources are available for support.
C	Nurses should recognize that negative emotions may affect motivation of women to understand and ask questions about GDM.
C	Nurses can favorably influence the return rates for postpartum glucose testing by raising awareness of implications of GDM on future health.
B	Maternal physical activity declines across gestation , possibly due to changing perception of physical activity intensity.
B	Our purpose was to a ) determine whether rating of perceived exertion ( RPE ) during a treadmill exercise changes at a given energy expenditure , and b ) identify the influence of prepregnancy physical activity behavior on this relationship.
M	Fifty-one subjects were classified as either exercisers ( N = 26 ) or sedentary ( N = 25 ).
M	Participants visited our laboratory at 20 and 32 weeks gestation and at 12 weeks postpartum.
M	At each visit , women performed 5 minutes of moderate and vigorous treadmill exercise ; speed was self-selected.
M	Heart rate ( HR ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , and RPE were measured during the last minute at each treadmill intensity.
R	At moderate intensity , postpartum VO2 was higher compared with 20- or 32-week VO2 , but there was no difference for HR or RPE.
R	For vigorous intensity , postpartum HR and VO2 were higher than at 32 weeks , but RPE was not different at any time points.
C	RPE does not differ by pregnancy time point at either moderate or vigorous intensity.
C	However , relative to energy cost , physical activity was perceived to be more difficult at 32 weeks compared with other time points.
C	Pregnant women , then , may compensate for physiological changes during gestation by decreasing walking/running speeds.
B	Cancer risk assessment should stratify screening and enable preventive health interventions based on individuals' risk of developing cancer.
B	Studies are underway to develop epigenetic tests , including trials investigating women's risk of female-specific cancers.
P	Given potential consequences for quality of life and care , women considering such assessment need to be able to make a fully informed choice.
P	It is currently unknown what information they require.
M	We conducted 4 focus groups with 25 women ( aged 30-65 years ) to explore what they want to know about epigenetic cancer risk assessment , how they evaluate its usefulness , and how they would like to be informed about their risk.
M	Independent coders categorised paraphrases based on transcribed recordings of the group discussions to enable a summarising text analysis.
R	The women in the study wanted to understand how the epigenetic approach is different from established genomic tests , how epigenetic changes relate to cancer , and whether the test enables monitoring of one's cancer risk ( n = 11 ).
R	Furthermore , they desired information about their basic cancer risks ( n = 11 ) , about the quality of the assessment ( n = 9 ) , and about measures to deal with a risk result ( n = 11 ).
C	Informed consent in epigenetic cancer risk assessments depends on whether basic cancer risks , uncertainties of testing , and effects of tests on care management are transparently communicated prior to testing.
C	These requirements are not limited to epigenetic testing.
C	Accordingly , physicians and health authorities will have to provide multi-layered information when counselling women on cancer risk assessment.
B	Being ranked second among countries with the highest estimated number of people living with HIV in South East Asia , 28.8% of PWIDs in the country are HIV-infected.
B	Despite the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target , gaps exist across the HIV treatment cascade , including testing of those likely to be HIV positive , linking those tested HIV positive to care , and sustaining the antiretroviral ( ARV ) drugs uptake.
P	This study aims to evaluate why such gaps exist , by exploring the barriers and challenges present at each stage of the cascade.
M	A qualitative study was conducted in Bali , in 2016.
M	Interviews were performed among PWIDs who experienced challenges at any stage of the cascade.
M	The interview covered various questions including on HIV , HIV testing , and treatment adherence.
M	Data was analyzed thematically.
R	Participants said they sought testing only when they were concerned about their health ; were afraid of testing positive to HIV due to the stigma around HIV ; and that starting ARV treatment early was not necessary because they still felt healthy.
R	Participants also expressed the need for support from health providers , peers , and family to stay on ARV , particularly in the face of treatment fatigue ; and issues around the quality of care to maintain retention.
C	Challenges hamper each stage of the HIV treatment cascade.
C	Implications and recommendations are discussed.
B	New psychoactive substances ( NPSs ) have been emerging into prominence on the European drug scene and around the world in the last few years.
B	The number of NPSs is constantly increasing , but there is a lack of research in this field , while their unwanted effects are still barely known ( as is true also of their long-term consequences ).
B	Unfortunately , when unwanted effects do occur they can lead to serious consequences on physical and mental health , in line with the descriptions given in the literature.
M	The case report refers to a 25-year-old man who had been treated with buprenorphine to cure opioid addiction , and then developed an acute psychotic reaction after pentedrone had been abused.
M	He was frightened , and experienced altered mental states and socially disruptive responses: logorrhoea , disorganized behaviour , with delusions of persecutions and reference , haptic hallucinations , anxiety and impaired insight.
M	In order to allow treatment of his acute psychotic disorder , the patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital , and antipsychotic medication was administered in combination with benzodiazepines.
M	Meanwhile , buprenorphine tapering was performed rapidly.
M	Only a few days later the psychotic symptoms resolved.
M	Treatment of the patient continued at the addiction department for a short period , but he was not motivated or prepared for that.
M	His imminent discharge was followed by relapse into drug use.
C	It seems that pentedrone use could be associated with the resolution of acute psychosis after a short period of antipsychotic treatment.
B	Research evidence suggests that journal clubs ( JCs ) are one approach which can be used to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.
B	However , there are issues which potentially threaten their viability such as on-going participation or compliance with attendance , which require further exploration.
B	The objectives of this study are: to explore the views and perspectives of allied health practitioners ( AHPs ) regarding the use of any type of JC in promoting evidence-based practice ( EBP ) ; to identify ways in which an innovative model of JC developed by the International Centre for Allied Health Evidence ( iCAHE ) might be refined.
M	A qualitative descriptive study utilising focus group interviews with various groups of AHP was undertaken-those who have been exposed to the iCAHE JC model and those who have no experience of the iCAHE model ( although they may have had exposure to other forms of JC ).
M	Maximum variation sampling was used to recruit participants for the study.
M	Transcripts of focus groups were coded and distilled into content-related categories.
R	Six focus groups with 39 AHPs were facilitated.
R	Allied health practitioners perspectives' on JCs were classified in five broad categories: utility and benefits of a JC , elements of an effective and sustainable JC , barriers to participation , incentives for participation , and opportunities for improvement in the current iCAHE JC model.
R	Overall , JCs were seen as a forum for reflective practice and keeping up-to-date with research evidence , and a venue for learning the processes involved in critical appraisal.
R	Limited knowledge of statistics and heavy clinical workload were reported as barriers to participation in a JC.
R	Strategies such as mentoring , strong support from managers , and providing CPD ( continuing professional development ) points can potentially address these barriers.
R	Opportunities for refinement of the current iCAHE model were raised.
C	This study suggests that a structured model of JC such as iCAHE's model is acceptable , and likely to be used with enthusiasm by AHP to achieve EBP.
C	Future research should explore the impact of iCAHE JC compared with no JC exposure , and other forms of exposure to JCs , in influencing change in allied health practitioners behaviours and evidence implementation.
B	A large body of literature sustains the association between long-lasting caregiving for impaired significant others and increased health risk.
B	Depression , elevated heart rate , and blood pressure at rest are key measures of health risk , mostly cardiovascular , which have been generally studied in caregivers of patients affected by dementia or chronic illness.
B	Limited research has been conducted on emotional and cardiovascular impact of family caregiving for terminally ill cancer patients.
P	The aim of the present study was to examine psychological and cardiovascular responses in terminal cancer caregivers.
M	Twenty relative caregivers who provided in-home or hospice care to terminally ill cancer patients and 20 age-and gender-matched controls were interviewed and assessed for emotional distress.
M	Measures of cardiovascular risk , blood pressure , and heart rate were recorded at rest in 4 separate sessions.
R	Caregivers reported higher levels of depression , state anxiety , and more sleep dysfunctions than controls.
R	They also revealed heightened systolic and diastolic blood pressure in some measurements.
R	Moreover , elevation of heart rate was associated with caregiving length.
C	The caregiving stressor is associated with considerable psychological vulnerability , sleep disorders , and risk of alterations in the cardiovascular system , which seem to be modulated by caregiving characteristics.
C	This study shows the importance of screening caregivers for psychological as well as physical symptoms and disorders.
C	An awareness of burden of terminal cancer caregivers could lead to timely proactive preventive interventions on their physical and mental health , to decrease negative outcomes.
P	To explore and describe how persons with an acquired brain injury ( ABI ) managed the everyday technology ( ET ) that they needed to use in their workplace and how this use influences their opportunities to work.
M	Nine persons with an ABI were interviewed and observed when managing ET in their workplace.
M	The data were analysed qualitatively with a constant comparative method.
R	The main category , "The challenge of managing ET in the workplace" , consisted of three categories , all of which reflected different kinds of discrepancies between the participants' ability to manage ET and the demands that ET imposes on them in work: "Struggling with ET to be able to continue to work ; "Depending on strategies to cope with ET to continue in a particular profession" , and "Managing ET at work but concerned about keeping up with the changes".
C	The result revealed discrepancies between the abilities of the persons with ABI to manage ET in relation to the demands that technology imposed on them in their work setting.
C	This indicated that professionals need to consider the role of ET when designing interventions supporting a person's return to work after an ABI.
B	Health disparities and disparities in the provision of healthcare to people with disabilities remains a topic of concern.
B	Research demonstrates that attitudes of healthcare providers contribute to this disparity.
B	The approach to disability education and training in medical school warrants evaluation.
P	This study sought to investigate the efficacy of an educational intervention in cultivating positive attitudes towards disability in medical students , and determine the specific impact of an interaction-based hospital visit to patients undergoing neurological rehabilitation.
M	Web-based questionnaires were distributed to medical students undertaking a 12-week 'Understanding Disability' module.
M	Measures of anxiety , attitude , competency and empathy were obtained from 65 students at the beginning ( T1 ) , middle ( T2 ) and end ( T3 ) of the module.
M	At T2 , approximately half of the students had completed a hospital visit and half had not.
R	Scores changed significantly across all constructs between the beginning and end of the module suggesting a positive overall module effect.
R	Findings confirmed a significant difference in anxiety and empathy levels between the group of students who had completed the visit to the rehabilitation hospital by the middle survey wave and those who had not , indicating a specific placement effect.
C	Our findings suggest that interpersonal contact with individuals with disabilities has a distinct impact on the affective variables of anxiety and empathy.
C	Previous research suggests that this contributes towards improved attitudes to disability.
C	Overall , we provide strong evidence for the inclusion of contact-based educational interventions in medical school to enhance students' attitudes to disability.

B	Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , known as free radicals , play a key role in the etiology and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by creating vascular oxidative stress.
P	This review will discuss current biological research about the enzymatic and nonenzymatic sources of oxidative stress , free radical chemistry , and how it pertains to endothelial dysfunction-a hallmark of cardiovascular disease.
M	An integrative review of the literature was conducted.
R	Free radicals lower the bioavailability of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide and therefore , through numerous chemical reactions , negatively affect vascular biology and endothelial function.
R	Endothelial dysfunction is considered to be integral in the initiation of atherosclerosis.
C	The success and failures of current therapies to reduce oxidative stress are discussed in terms of implications for nursing research on exogenous antioxidants , pharmacotherapy , and lifestyle change.
P	The goal of this systematic review was to reach scientific generalizations regarding the assessment of risk for pressure ulcers based on the results of previous studies that made use of the Braden Scale.
P	DATA SOURCES: This research was performed by using a retrospective screening of studies relevant to the subject.
P	In Turkey , the first validity and reliability study for the Braden Scale was performed by Oguz and Olgun in 1998.
P	For this reason , the authors' research was conducted between March 2 , 2012 , and August 4 , 2012 , as a systematic review analysis by evaluating studies in Turkey that made use of the Braden Scale between 1998 and 2012.
P	Screening was performed by using different combinations of 8 keywords in Turkish and English to scan a total of 10 national and international databases.
P	A total of 2375 studies were evaluated , and 16 studies were included and considered within the context of this research.
P	RESULTS AND
C	It was determined that the studies considered within the context of the current research were conducted between 1998 and 2012 ; 5 of these studies were experimental and 11 were descriptive ; the sample size varied between 22 and 422 ; the majority were performed in intensive care units ; and the study samples were mostly composed of patients.
C	The Braden Scale was used in these studies for forming samples by identifying high-risk patients.
C	Two studies evaluated the reliability of the Braden Scale , whereas 7 other studies calculated the reliability coefficient.
C	Only 1 study included results for sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value ( which represent the predictive criteria of assessment tools ).
C	Four studies indicated cutoff values , which varied between 14 and 18.
C	A general evaluation of these studies' results revealed limited evidence of effective risk assessment by the Braden Scale.
B	The Health Disparities Collaboratives ( HDCs ) , a quality improvement ( QI ) collaborative incorporating rapid QI , a chronic care model , and learning sessions , have been implemented in over 900 community health centers across the country.
P	To determine the HDC's effect on clinical processes and outcomes , their financial impact , and factors important for successful implementation.
M	Systematic review of the literature.
R	The HDCs improve clinical processes of care over short-term period of 1 to 2 years , and clinical processes and outcomes over longer period of 2 to 4 years.
R	Most participants perceive that the HDCs are successful and worth the effort.
R	Analysis of the Diabetes Collaborative reveals that it is societally cost-effective , with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33 ,386 per quality-adjusted life year , but that consistent revenue streams for the initiative do not exist.
R	Common barriers to improvement include lack of resources , time , and staff burnout.
R	Highest ranked priorities for more funding are money for direct patient services , data entry , and staff time for QI.
R	Other common requests for more assistance are help with patient self-management , information systems , and getting providers to follow guidelines.
R	Relatively low-cost ways to increase staff morale and prevent burnout include personal recognition , skills development opportunities , and fair distribution of work.
C	The HDCs have successfully improved quality of care , and the Diabetes Collaborative is societally cost-effective , but policy reforms are necessary to create a sustainable business case for these health centers that serve many uninsured and underinsured populations.
B	Despite its increasing personal and societal impact , assessment of late-life anxiety has received relatively little attention in psychiatric research.
B	Differential symptom presentation and physical comorbidities among the elderly , relative to younger cohorts creates a need for anxiety measures that are psychometrically validated in the elderly.
M	The present study examined the factor structure and discriminant validity of the state-trait inventory for cognitive and somatic anxiety ( STICSA ) in a sample of Italian middle-aged and older adults.
M	Participants were 396 community-dwelling middle-aged ( 50-64 years ) and older ( 65 years ) adults.
M	In addition to the STICSA , participants completed two depression measures and a general well-being survey with physical and mental health subscales.
R	Factor analysis supported the validity of both state-trait and cognitive-somatic distinctions underlying the STICSA , all dimensions exhibited excellent internal consistency ( Cronbach's coefficients 0.86 ) , and correlations with depression measures provided limited evidence for differentiation of anxious and depressive symptoms.
R	The STICSA also showed evidence of discriminating anxious symptoms from physical health symptoms , a particularly relevant feature of a valid anxiety measure in elderly samples.
C	The STICSA appears to be a valid measure of cognitive and somatic anxiety in the elderly.
B	Body mass index ( BMI ) is widely used to assess the prevalence of childhood obesity in populations and its relationship with blood pressure has been observed.
B	However , no studies on the distribution of fat mass index ( FMI ) and fat-free mass index ( FFMI ) and their relationship with blood pressure have been reported.
P	The present study examined the distribution of BMI , FMI , FFMI and the relationship with blood pressure among children aged 7-12 years in Shandong , China.
M	A total of 4326 children ( 2165 boys and 2161 girls ) aged 7-12 years participated in this study.
M	Height , weight , skinfold thickness ( SFT ) and blood pressure ( BP ) of all subjects were measured , body fat percentages ( BF% ) were calculated by regression equation , fat mass index ( FMI ) and fat-free mass index ( FFMI ) were calculated according to the following expressions: FMI ( kg/m( 2 ) ) - BF% X weight/height( 2 ) and FFMI ( kg/m( 2 ) ) ( weight - BF% X weight )/height( 2 ).
R	SBP and DBP were positively correlated with FMI , FFMI and BMI in both boys and girls , the strongest correlation observed for BP was with FMI.
R	The prevalence of relatively high BP increased with FMI percentiles , this trend being especially obvious in upper percentiles of FMI.
R	The prevalence of relatively high BP increased from 3.74% ( boys ) and 7.48% ( girls ) in the < 5th FMI percentile group to 56.19% ( boys ) and 50.94% ( girls ) in the >= 95th FMI percentile group , an increase of 14.0- and 5.8-times.
C	There is a strong positive relationship between FMI and BP in children ; the correlation between BP and FMI was stronger than with FFMI and BMI.
B	The purpose of this study was to determine which office chair feature is better at improving spine posture in sitting.
M	Participants ( n = 28 ) were radiographed in standing , maximum flexion and seated in four chair conditions: control , lumbar support , seat pan tilt and backrest with scapular relief.
M	Measures of lumbar lordosis , intervertebral joint angles and sacral tilt were compared between conditions and sex.
R	Sitting consisted of approximately 70% of maximum range of spine flexion.
R	No differences in lumbar flexion were found between the chair features or control.
R	Significantly more anterior pelvic rotation was found with the lumbar support ( p = 0.0028 ) and seat pan tilt ( p < 0.0001 ).
R	Males had significantly more anterior pelvic rotation and extended intervertebral joint angles through L1-L3 in all conditions ( p < 0.0001 ).
C	No one feature was statistically superior with respect to minimising spine flexion , however , seat pan tilt resulted in significantly improved pelvic posture.
C	Seat pan tilt , and to some extent lumbar supports , appear to improve seated postures.
C	However , sitting , regardless of chair features used , still involves near end range flexion of the spine.
C	This will increase stresses to the spine and could be a potential injury generator during prolonged seated exposures.
B	The effects of marijuana or THC on driving has been tested in several studies , but usually not in conjunction with physiological and subjective responses and not in comparison to alcohol effects on all three types of measures.
P	To assess the effects of two dosages of THC relative to alcohol on driving performance , physiological strain , and subjective feelings.
M	We tested the subjective feelings and driving abilities after placebo , smoking two dosages of THC ( 13 mg and 17 mg ) , drinking ( 0.05% BAC ) and 24 h after smoking the high dose THC cigarette , while monitoring physiological activity of the drugs by heart rate.
M	Fourteen healthy students , all recreational marijuana users , participated in the study.
R	Both levels of THC cigarettes significantly affected the subjects in a dose-dependent manner.
R	The moderate dose of alcohol and the low THC dose were equally detrimental to some of the driving abilities , with some differences between the two drugs.
R	THC primarily caused elevation in physical effort and physical discomfort during the drive while alcohol tended to affect sleepiness level.
R	After THC administration , subjects drove significantly slower than in the control condition , while after alcohol ingestion , subjects drove significantly faster than in the control condition.
R	No THC effects were observed after 24 h on any of the measures.

B	The psychosocial impact of acquired dysarthria on the speaker is well recognized.
B	To date , speech-and-language therapists have no instrument available to measure this construct.
B	This has implications for outcome measurement and for planning intervention.
B	This paper describes the Dysarthria Impact Profile ( DIP ) , an instrument that has the potential to meet this need in clinical practice.
P	To describe the development of the DIP , which was devised as part of a larger study to measure psychosocial impact of acquired dysarthria from the speaker's perspective.
M	The current psychometric properties of the DIP are examined.
M	The scale was administered to 31 participants with acquired dysarthria.
M	The internal consistency of the scale items and their intra-rater reliability were investigated.
M	Concurrent validity was assessed for the portion of the scale ( Section A ) assessing impact of acquired dysarthria on self-perception , self-concept and self-esteem by comparing the results with changes in self-concept as determined by the Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale ( HISD II ).
R	The DIP shows good internal consistency and strong intra-rater reliability overall.
R	There was a strong , statistically significant , correlation between results on Section A of the DIP and the results of the HISD II suggesting convergent validity for this portion of the scale.
R	There are some limitations to the scale in its current format and these are highlighted.
C	The scale is now ready for further refinement and development.
C	Once validated , it should act as a robust outcome measure for clinicians.
B	Benzodiazepines ( BZD ) are among the most widely prescribed drugs in developed countries.
B	Since BZD can produce tolerance and dependence even in a short time , their use is recommended for a very limited time.
B	However , these recommendations have been largely disregarded.
B	The chronic use of BZD causes a number of serious side effects , i.e. , cognitive impairment , falls , traffic accidents , dependence and tolerance.
B	The aim of the present study was to evaluate quality of life ( QoL ) in a cohort of 62 consecutive high-dose BZD-dependent patients seeking a BZD detoxification.
M	Patients seeking BZD detoxification were evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-12 ) and the short form-36 questionnaire ( SF-36 ).
R	Patients showed a significant reduction of QoL as measured by either SF-36 or GHQ-12.
R	In particular , the greater impairment was observed in the items exploring physical and emotional status.
R	Physical functioning was the item more influenced by the length of BZD abuse.
R	Female patients showed a greater reduction of QoL compared to male , at least in some of the explored items.
R	Social functioning scores were greatly reduced.
C	The present study shows for the first time that high-doses BZD dependent patients have a reduced QoL and a reduced social functioning , along with high levels of psychological distress.

B	Diagnosis of trichotillomania ( TTM ) requires meeting several criteria that aim to embody the core pathology of the disorder.
B	These criteria are traditionally interpreted monothetically , in that they are all equally necessary for diagnosis.
B	Alternatively , a dimensional conceptualization of psychopathology allows for examination of the relatedness of each criterion to the TTM latent continuum.
P	First , to examine the ability of recently removed criteria ( B and C ) to identify the latent dimensions of TTM psychopathology , such that they discriminate between individuals with low and high degrees of hair pulling severity.
P	Second , to determine the impact of removing criteria B and C on the information content of remaining diagnostic criteria.
P	Third , to determine the psychometric properties of remaining TTM diagnostic criteria that remain largely unchanged in DSM-5 ; that is , whether they measure distinct or overlapping levels of TTM psychopathology.
P	Fourth , to determine whether information content derived from diagnostic criteria aid in the prediction of disease trajectory ( i.e. , can relapse propensity be predicted from criteria endorsement patterns ).
M	Statistics derived from item response theory were used to examine diagnostic criteria endorsement in 91 adults with TTM who underwent psychotherapy.
R	The removal of two criteria in DSM-5 and psychometric validity of remaining criteria was supported.
R	Additionally , individual trait parameters were used to predict treatment progress , uncovering predictive power where none previously existed.
C	Diagnostic criteria for TTM should be examined in dimensional models , which allow for nuanced and sensitive measurement of core symptomology in treatment contexts.

P	To gain insight into nurses' perceptions and use of providing structure ( PS ) as an intervention during psychiatric inpatient care.
M	Interviews were conducted with nurses ( n = 18 ) from two inpatient wards in psychiatry immediately following the occurrence of a PS event.
M	This was done immediately following the occurrence of a PS event.
M	Transcripts were analyzed using a qualitative coding process.
C	Four general and 14 specific PS activities were described associated with the nursing intervention PS.
C	Nurses can now refer to specific activities of PS.
C	An elaborated definition of PS is provided to facilitate a better understanding and using of PS as a psychiatric nursing intervention.
B	Cholinesterase inhibitors ( ChEIs ) are being used for increasingly long periods of time , even in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease.
B	Because there is little data to help clinicians to decide on when it is safe and appropriate to discontinue ChEIs after long-term use , practices may vary widely.
M	An internet-based survey was undertaken of Canadian dementia experts ( geriatric psychiatrists , neurologists , geriatricians ) involved in clinical trial research.
M	Recommendations for ChEI discontinuation were determined based on responses to questions dealing with patient/caregiver preference , administrative considerations , effectiveness , and adverse events.
R	There was reasonable consensus that ChEIs should be discontinued based on patient and caregiver preference , and in the presence of severe bothersome adverse events.
R	There was much less consensus on issues related to effectiveness - in particular , what constitutes greater than expected decline.
R	There was a general reluctance to rely on any single measure of cognition , function and/or behavior , and in particular , the MMSE was seen as unhelpful for making decisions about discontinuation.
C	Recommendations for discontinuing ChEIs after long-term use from a survey of dementia experts are presented.
C	Ideally , clinical practice guidelines based on controlled discontinuation trials are needed.
P	Despite advances in cochlear implant and hearing aid technology , many children with hearing loss continue to exhibit poorer language skills than their hearing peers.
P	This randomized pilot trial tested the effects of a parent-implemented communication treatment targeting prelinguistic communication skills in infants and toddlers with hearing loss.
M	Participants included 19 children between 6 and 24 months of age with moderate to profound , bilateral hearing loss.
M	Children were randomly assigned to the parent-implemented communication treatment group or a "usual care" control group.
M	Parents and children participated in 26 , hour-long home sessions in which parents were taught to use communication support strategies.
M	The primary outcome measures were the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales ( Wetherby & Prizant , 2003 ) , a measure of child prelinguistic skills , and parental use of communication support strategies during a naturalistic play session.
R	Parents in the treatment group increased their use of communication support strategies by 17%.
R	Children in the treatment group made statistically significant more gains in speech prelinguistic skills ( d = 1.09 , p = .03 ) as compared with the control group.
R	There were no statistically significant differences in social and symbolic prelinguistic skills ; however , the effect sizes were large ( d = 0.78 , p = .08 ; d = 0.91 , p = .10 ).
C	This study provides modest preliminary support for the short-term effects of a parent-implemented communication treatment for children with hearing loss.
C	Parents learned communication support strategies that subsequently impacted child prelinguistic skills.
C	Although these results appear promising , the sample size is very small.
C	Future research should include a larger clinical trial and child-level predictors of response to treatment.
B	Internal Medicine resident ( IMR ) physician reporting of patient safety events ( PSEs ) is suboptimal and may be related to poor attitudes toward reporting.
P	The objective was to evaluate the impact of a PSE reporting expectation on the rates of reporting among IMRs.
M	In this prospective cohort study , IMRs were informed of an expectation to submit 1 or more PSE report per month based on the ACGME core competencies.
M	The PSE reports were collected over 9 months and compared with a 4-month baseline before the expectation.
M	Report quality and IMRs' attitudes were also evaluated.
R	There was a significant and initial increase in the total number of reports.
R	However , the number of IMRs meeting the expectation of 1 or more report per month initially rose but was not sustained over the 9-month observational period.
R	Report quality and IMRs attitudes toward reporting were positive but unchanged over time.
C	Although a reporting expectation increased the total number of reports , the majority of IMRs did not maintain a 1 or more PSE report per month despite positive attitudes.
P	North American research finds increased sexual risk-taking among teenagers with same-sex partners , but understanding of underlying processes is limited.
P	The research carried out in the United Kingdom compares teenagers' early sexual experiences according to same-or opposite-sex partner , focusing on unwanted sex in addition to risk-taking , and exploring underlying psychosocial differences.
M	Multivariate analyses combined self-reported data from two randomized control trials of school sex education programs( N = 10 ,250 ).
M	Outcomes from sexually experienced teenagers( N = 3 ,766 ) were partner pressure to have first sex and subsequent regret , and sexual risk measures including pregnancy.
M	Covariates included self-esteem , future expectations , substance use , and communication with mother.
R	By the time of follow-up ( mean age , 16 ) , same-sex genital contact ( touching or oral or anal ) was reported by 2.3% of teenagers , with the majority also reporting heterosexual intercourse.
R	A total of 39% reported heterosexual intercourse and no same-sex genital contact.
R	Boys were more likely to report partner pressure ( Odds ratio [OR] = 2.56 , 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.29-5.08 ) and regret ( OR = 2.32 ; 95% CI = 1.39-3.86 ) in relation to first same-sex genital contact than first heterosexual intercourse , but girls showed no differences according to partner type.
R	Teenagers with bisexual behavior reported greater pregnancy or partner pregnancy risk than teenagers with exclusively opposite-sex partners ( girls , OR = 4.51 , 95% CI = 2.35-8.64 ; boys , OR = 4.43 , 95% CI = 2.41-8.14 ) , partially reduced by attitudinal and behavioral differences.
C	This UK study confirms greater reporting of sexual risk-taking among teenagers with same-sex partners , and suggests that boys in this group are vulnerable to unwanted sex.
C	It suggests limitations to the interpretation of differences , in terms of psychosocial risk factors common to all adolescents.

B	Medical tourism is a term used to describe the phenomenon of individuals intentionally traveling across national borders to privately purchase medical care.
B	The medical tourism industry has been portrayed in the media as an "escape valve" providing alternative care options as a result of vast economic asymmetries between the global north and global south and the flexible regulatory environment in which care is provided to medical tourists.
B	Discourse suggesting the medical tourism industry necessarily enhances access to medical care has been employed by industry stakeholders to promote continued expansion of the industry ; however , it remains unknown how this discourse informs industry practices on the ground.
B	Using case study methodology , this research examines the perspectives and experiences of industry stakeholders working and living in a dental tourism industry site in northern Mexico to develop a better understanding of the ways in which common discourses of the industry are taken up or resisted by various industry stakeholders and the possible implications of these practices on health equity.
R	Interview discussions with a range of industry stakeholders suggest that care provision in this particular location enables international patients to access high quality dental care at more affordable prices than typically available in their home countries.
R	However , interview participants also raised concerns about the quality of care provided to medical tourists and poor access to needed care amongst local populations.
R	These concerns disrupt discourses about the positive health impacts of the industry commonly circulated by industry stakeholders positioned to profit from these unjust industry practices.
C	We argue in this paper that elite industry stakeholders in our case site took up discourses of medical tourism as enhancing access to care in ways that mask health equity concerns for the industry and justify particular industry activities despite health equity concerns for these practices.
C	This research provides new insight into the ways in which the medical tourism industry raises ethical concern and the structures of power informing unethical practices.
B	Current projections indicate that the UK faces a 252% increase in people aged over 65 with one or more long term conditions ( LTC ) by 2050.
B	Nurses , managing their own caseloads and clinics , working across sectors and organisational boundaries and as part of a wider multi-disciplinary team , are frequently seen as key to managing this growing demand.
B	However , the evidence base informing the nursing role in managing LTC , the most effective configuration of the multi-disciplinary team and the policy evidence relating to the infrastructure required to support cross organisational working , remains weak.
P	To explore , identify and characterise the origins , processes and outcomes of effective chronic disease management models and the nursing contributions to such models.
M	Case study whole systems analysis using qualitative interview methods.
M	Two community matron services , two primary care ( GP ) practice nursing services , two hospital based specialist nursing services were purposefully sampled from across England and Wales.
M	Selection criteria were derived using a consensus conference.
M	The nurses in the service , all patients and carers on the caseload , members of the multi-disciplinary team and stakeholders were invited to participate.
M	Semi-structured interviews with all participants , thematic analysis within a whole system framework.
R	The study found high levels of clinical nursing expertise which in the case of the community matrons was meeting the aim of reducing hospital admissions.
R	Both the primary care and hospital nurse specialist indicate similar levels of clinical expertise which was highly valued by medical colleagues and patients.
R	Patients continued to experience fragmented care determined by diagnostic categories rather than patient need and by the specific remit of the clinic or service the patient was using.
R	Patient data systems are still organised around the impact on services and prevalence of disease at an individual level and not around the patient experience of disease.
C	Nurses are making a major contribution to meeting the policy objectives for long term conditions.
C	Primary care nurses and hospital nurse specialists do broadly similar roles.
C	The scope of the nursing roles and services studied were idiosyncratic , opportunistic and reactive , rather than planned and commissioned on an analysis of local population need.

B	The connection between stress and disease has been part of folk wisdom for a long time and has even made its way into our language with phrases such as scared to death' and a broken heart'.
B	Takotsubo syndrome is a form of acute , reversible heart failure characterized by ballooning of the left ventricle.
B	Post-menopausal women are primarily affected , but cases have been described in both sexes and at all ages.
B	The complete pathophysiology is unknown , but the disease has been connected to psychological or physical stress and a surge in catecholamines.
B	Despite the strong connection with stress , knowledge about the life of patients before the onset of Takotsubo syndrome is lacking.
P	The aim of this study was to describe and interpret patients' narratives about long-term stress experienced before the onset of Takotsubo syndrome.
M	Nineteen people diagnosed with Takotsubo syndrome were interviewed.
M	The narrative interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.
M	The resulting texts were analysed using phenomenological hermeneutics.
R	The analysis revealed that the interviewees lived under stressful circumstances , characterized by feeling burdened by responsibilities , injustice and uncertainty , long before the onset of Takotsubo syndrome.
R	This long-term stress wore down the defences of the interviewees to the degree that their capacity was exhausted and the smallest stressor could tip them over the edge'.
R	The findings indicated that the social structure of gender possibly contributed to the interviewees' condition.
C	These findings indicated that long-term stressful circumstances may cause vulnerability to acute psychological or physical stressors and , subsequently , to the onset of Takotsubo syndrome.
B	The Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Healthy Days items are well known measures of health-related quality of life.
B	The validity of the SF-36 for older adults and those with disabilities has been questioned.
P	Assess the extent to which the SF-36 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Healthy Days items measure the same aspects of health ; whether the SF-36 and the CDC unhealthy days items are invariant across gender , functional status , or the presence of chronic health conditions of older adults ; and whether each of the SF-36's eight subscales is independently associated with the CDC Healthy Days items.
M	We analyzed data from 66 ,269 adult Medicare advantage members age 65 and older.
M	We used confirmatory factor analyses and regression modeling to test associations between the CDC Healthy Days items and subscales of the SF-36.
R	The CDC Healthy Days items were associated with the SF-36 global measures of physical and mental health.
R	The CDC physically unhealthy days item was associated with the SF-36 subscales for bodily pain , physical role limitations , and general health , while the CDC mentally unhealthy days item was associated with the SF-36 subscales for mental health , emotional role limitations , vitality and social functioning.
R	The SF-36 physical functioning subscale was not independently associated with either of the CDC Healthy Days items.
C	The CDC Healthy Days items measure similar domains as the SF-36 but appear to assess HRQOL without regard to limitations in functioning.

B	Children exposed to maltreatment show neural sensitivity to facial cues signalling threat.
B	However , little is known about how maltreatment influences the processing of social threat cues more broadly , and whether atypical processing of social threat cues relates to psychiatric risk.
M	Forty-one 10- to 14-year-old children underwent a social rejection-themed emotional Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging: 21 children with a documented history of maltreatment ( 11 F ) and 19 comparison children with no maltreatment history ( 11 F ).
M	Groups were matched on age , pubertal status , gender , IQ , socioeconomic status , ethnicity and reading ability.
M	Classic colour Stroop stimuli were also administered in the same paradigm to investigate potential differences in general cognitive control.
R	Compared with their peers , children who had experienced maltreatment showed reduced activation in the Rejection versus Neutral condition , across circuitry previously implicated in abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , including the left anterior insula , extending into left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex ; left amygdala ; left inferior parietal cortex ( STS ) ; and bilateral visual association cortex , encompassing the cuneus and lingual gyrus.
R	No group differences in neural or behavioural responses were found for the classic colour Stroop conditions.
R	Significant negative associations between activity in bilateral cuneus and STS during the rejection-themed Stroop and higher self-reported PTSD symptomatology , including dissociation , were observed in children exposed to maltreatment.
C	Our findings indicate a pattern of altered neural response to social rejection cues in maltreated children.
C	Compared to their peers , these children displayed relative hypoactivation to rejection cues in regions previously associated with PTSD , potentially reflecting an avoidant coping response.
C	It is suggested that such atypical processing of social threat may index latent vulnerability to future psychopathology in general and PTSD in particular.
B	In high income countries , injuries account for 40 % of all child deaths , representing the leading cause of child mortality and a major source of morbidity.
B	The need for studies across age groups , and use of health related quality of life measures that assess functional limitations in multiple health domains , with sampling at specific post-injury time points has been identified.
B	The objective of this study was to describe the impact of childhood injury and recovery on health related quality of life ( HRQoL ) for the 12 months after injury.
M	In this prospective cohort study parents of children 0-16 years old attending British Columbia Children's Hospital for an injury were surveyed over 12 months post-injury.
M	Surveys assessed HRQoL at four points: baseline ( pre-injury ) , one month , four to six months and 12 months post injury.
M	Generalized estimating equation models identified factors associated with changes in HRQoL over time.
R	A total of 256 baseline surveys were completed.
R	Response rates for follow-ups at one , four and twelve months were 74 % ( 186 ) , 67 % ( 169 ) and 64 % ( 161 ) , respectively.
R	The mean age of participants was 7.9 years and 30 % were admitted to the hospital.
R	At baseline , a retrospective measure of pre-injury health , the mean HRQoL score was 90.7.
R	Mean HRQoL ratings at one , four and 12 months post injury were 77.8 , 90.3 and 91.3 , respectively.
R	Both being older and being hospitalized were associated with a steeper slope to recovery.
C	Although injuries are prevalent , the long term impacts of most childhood injuries are limited.
C	Regardless of injury severity , most injured children recuperated quickly , and had regained total baseline status by four month post-injury.
C	However , although hospitalization did not appear to impact long term psychosocial recovery , at four and 12 months post injury a greater proportion of hospitalized children continued to have depressed physical HRQoL scores.
C	Both older and hospitalized children reported greater impact to HRQoL at one month post injury , and both had a steeper slope to recovery and were on par with their peers by four month.
B	Raising a child with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) may negatively impact maternal mental health outcomes.
B	Feelings of loneliness and a lack of social support may contribute to these outcomes.
B	One factor that may help to promote better outcomes is hope.
B	The current study examined the associations between maternal hope , loneliness , social support , and depressive symptoms.
M	Ninety-four mothers of a child with ASD participated in this online study.
M	Mothers were predominantly Caucasian , middle class , and educated.
M	Children ranged in age from 2 to 13 years.
M	Mothers completed questionnaires assessing hope , loneliness , perceived social support from friends and family , and depressive symptoms.
R	The results of a multiple mediator model indicated that hope agency was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms via loneliness.
R	In a follow-up serial mediation model , hope agency was associated with depressive symptoms through family support and loneliness.
C	The present study contributes to the growing body of research focusing on positive personality characteristics and mental health outcomes in mothers of children with ASD.
C	Given that increased hopeful thinking was associated with less loneliness , the construct of hope should be given more attention in interventions that are aimed at improving maternal outcomes.
C	Increasing hopeful thinking may be particularly important in aiding with improvement during psychotherapy for mothers with clinical levels of depressive symptoms.

B	This study is to identify , summarise and synthesise literature on the causes of the evidence to practice gap for complex interventions in primary care.
M	This study is a systematic review of reviews.
M	MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Library and PsychINFO were searched , from inception to December 2013.
M	Eligible reviews addressed causes of the evidence to practice gap in primary care in developed countries.
M	Data from included reviews were extracted and synthesised using guidelines for meta-synthesis.
R	Seventy reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria and encompassed a wide range of topics , e.g. guideline implementation , integration of new roles , technology implementation , public health and preventative medicine.
R	None of the included papers used the term "cause" or stated an intention to investigate causes at all.
R	A descriptive approach was often used , and the included papers expressed "causes" in terms of "barriers and facilitators" to implementation.
R	We developed a four-level framework covering external context , organisation , professionals and intervention.
R	External contextual factors included policies , incentivisation structures , dominant paradigms , stakeholders' buy-in , infrastructure and advances in technology.
R	Organisation-related factors included culture , available resources , integration with existing processes , relationships , skill mix and staff involvement.
R	At the level of individual professionals , professional role , underlying philosophy of care and competencies were important.
R	Characteristics of the intervention that impacted on implementation included evidence of benefit , ease of use and adaptability to local circumstances.
R	We postulate that the "fit" between the intervention and the context is critical in determining the success of implementation.
C	This comprehensive review of reviews summarises current knowledge on the barriers and facilitators to implementation of diverse complex interventions in primary care.
C	To maximise the uptake of complex interventions in primary care , health care professionals and commissioning organisations should consider the range of contextual factors , remaining aware of the dynamic nature of context.
C	Future studies should place an emphasis on describing context and articulating the relationships between the factors identified here.

B	Long-term and early-onset cannabis consumption are implicated in subsequent substance-related problems.
B	The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate whether these patterns of cannabis use could impact cocaine withdrawal severity and cocaine craving intensity during detoxification.
B	In addition , we investigated their impact in the rehospitalization rates due to cocaine dependence 2.5 years after detoxification assessment.
M	The sample was composed of 93 female cocaine-dependent inpatients who were enrolled in an inpatient detoxification unit.
M	Cocaine withdrawal symptoms were measured at the 4th , 9th and 14th days of detoxification using the cocaine selective severity assessment ( CSSA ).
M	Data on the age of first years of drug use - alcohol , cannabis and cocaine - and the years of substance abuse were obtained using the Addiction Severity Index ( ASI-6 ).
M	Other relevant clinical variables were also investigated , including a 2.5 years follow-up assessment of number of rehospitalization due to cocaine dependence.
R	Early-onset cannabis use and long-term cannabis abuse Were associated with an increase instead of a reduction in the severity of cocaine withdrawal symptoms and craving intensity during detoxification.
R	In addition , long-term cannabis abuse predicted higher number of rehospitalization due to cocaine dependence after 2.5 years of the first detoxification assessment.
C	Early-onset cannabis use and long-term cannabis abuse are associated with a worse detoxification treatment response.
C	Our findings may help to identify patients who will struggle more severely to control cocaine withdrawal syndrome during early drug abstinence , and indicate that cannabis use prior to cocaine withdrawal should be considered an adverse factor.

P	A rigorous process of collaboration among multilingual and multicultural nursing faculties throughout Switzerland to define optimized learning goals for clinical assessment education at the bachelor's level is described in the context of wider European academic harmonization.
P	Formation of a consensus-seeking panel proved a useful strategy for disseminating knowledge among academic nursing faculties in the early years of tertiary nursing education.
P	The process enabled representatives of competing institutions to share scarce resources and articulate the added value of a bachelor's degree in nursing.
C	A consensus-building strategy has applicability for nursing faculties wishing to increase collaboration , efficiency , and effectiveness early in the process of academic nursing development.
C	Lack of availability of learning materials written in the languages of the local clinical setting is a barrier to teaching advanced assessment skills.
C	Clinical assessment education that teaches a systematic approach to data collection , analysis , and reporting is central to producing excellent clinical professionals.
B	The common mental disorders are potential risk factors for low bone mass as a result of disease and/or medication-related processes.
B	Quantitative heel ultrasound ( QUS ) is a portable and relatively cheap screening tool for determining fracture risk.
B	Thus , we investigated the association between QUS parameters , mood and anxiety disorders in a population-based sample of 745 men and 897 women.
M	Using a clinical interview ( SCID-I/NP ) , mood and anxiety disorders were identified.
M	Bone quality was established using QUS and included the following parameters: Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation ( BUA ) , Speed of Sound ( SOS ) and Stiffness Index ( SI ).
M	Anthropometry , socio-economic status ( SES ) , medication use and lifestyle factors were determined.
R	In men , mood and anxiety disorders were associated with lower age-weight- and smoking-adjusted SOS , BUA and SI.
R	In women , age was an effect modifier.
R	Among younger women ( <= 40 yr ) , mood disorders were associated with lower age-weight- and smoking-adjusted SOS and SI but not BUA.
R	No differences were detected in older women or women with anxiety disorders.
R	These patterns persisted after adjustment for activity , alcohol , calcium intake , SES and medications.
C	Cross-sectional study design , and possible residual or unrecognised confounding.
C	Our data suggest that bone quality , as measured by QUS , is reduced among men and younger women with a history of mood disorders.
C	Furthermore , an inverse association between anxiety disorders and bone quality was evident for men.
C	Thus , QUS may be a useful screening tool for determining fracture risk within these populations.

B	Adverse drug events ( ADEs ) represent a significant cause of injury in the ambulatory care setting.
B	Computerized physician order entry reduces rates of serious medication errors that can lead to ADEs in the inpatient setting , but few studies have evaluated whether computerized prescribing in the ambulatory setting reduces preventable ADE rates in ambulatory care.
P	To determine the rates of preventable ADEs before and after the implementation of computerized prescribing with basic clinical decision support for ordering medications.
M	Before-after study of ADE rates in practices implementing computer order entry.
M	Adult patients seeking care in primary care practices at academic medical centers in Boston , Massachusetts ( n = 41 ,819 ) , and Indianapolis , Indiana ( n = 9128 ).
M	We attempted to standardize the medication-related decision support knowledge base provided at the 2 sites , although the electronic records and presentation layers used at the 2 sites differed.
M	The primary outcome was preventable ADEs identified based on structured results or symptoms defined by extracting symptom concepts from provider notes ; potential ADEs were a secondary outcome.
R	Computerized prescribing did not significantly change the rate of preventable ADEs at either site.
R	Compared with Boston practices , the rate of potential ADEs was more than seven-fold greater at Indianapolis ( 6.4/10 ,000 patient-months vs. 49.5/10 ,000 patient-months , P < 0.001 ).
R	Computerized prescribing was associated with a 56% decrease in the potential ADE rate at Indianapolis ( 49.5 to 21.9/10 ,000 patient-months , P < 0.001 ) but a 104% increase at Boston ( 6.4 to 13.0/10 ,000 patient-months , P < 0.001 ).
R	Preventable ADEs that occurred after computerized prescribing was implemented were due to patient education issues , physicians ignoring feedback from CDSS , and incomplete computerized knowledge base was incomplete ( 34% , 33% , and 33% in Indianapolis and 44% , 28% , and 28% in Boston ).
C	The implementation of computerized prescribing in the ambulatory setting was not associated with any change in preventable ADEs but was associated with a decrease in potential ADEs at Indianapolis but an increase at Boston , although the absolute rate of ADEs was much lower in Boston.
B	We have previously identified long-term individual predictors of hazardous drinking in doctors , but longitudinal studies on contextual factors ( work and life stress ) and mental distress being independently linked to hazardous drinking over the first 15 years of a medical career are lacking.
M	Two nationwide cohorts of Norwegian doctors ( n = 1 ,052 ) from all 4 Norwegian universities were surveyed in their final year of medical school ( 1993/1994 and 1999 ) ( T1 ) , and 4 ( T2 ) , 10 ( T3 ) , and 15 ( T4 ) years later.
M	Hazardous drinking was measured using a validated 9-item version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test.
M	Work-related and other predictors were analysed using generalized estimating equations.
R	Ninety percent ( 947/1 ,052 ) responded at least once , and 42% ( 450/1 ,052 ) responded at all 4 time points.
R	Hazardous drinking was reported by 16% at T1 , 14% at T2 and T3 , and 15% at T4.
R	Life events ( p = 0.009 ) and mental distress ( p = 0.002 ) were adjusted predictors of hazardous drinking , in addition to male gender , no religious activity , drinking to cope with tension , and low conscientiousness.
C	Doctors' work-related stress was not linked to hazardous drinking , but life events , mental distress , and drinking to cope were.
C	Prevention should target mental distress and drinking to cope with tension.

P	To assess awareness and knowledge of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) in the adult Swedish population.
M	A cross-sectional study among young adults aged 18-30 years and the parents of children aged 12-15 years was conducted in 2007 to collect information on awareness and knowledge of HPV.
M	Correlates of HPV knowledge were investigated.
R	Awareness of cervical cancer and condyloma were high but awareness of HPV was low.
R	Many participants were uncertain or did not know about the causal relation between HPV and condyloma , and cancers other than cervical cancer.
R	Among parents , gender , age , country of origin , and education were the most important correlates of HPV knowledge.
R	Among young adults , these factors were gender , income , and education.
C	HPV education campaigns should particularly target young men and those with low education.
C	Educational messages should clarify the risk of HPV , and the causal relationship between HPV and condyloma , and other cancers.

B	The association between physical activity and quality of life in stroke survivors has not been analyzed within a framework related to the human development index.
B	This study aimed to identify differences in physical activity level and in the quality of life of stroke survivors in two cities differing in economic aspects of the human development index.
M	Two groups of subjects who had suffered a stroke at least a year prior to testing and showed hemiplegia or hemiparesis were studied: a group from Belo Horizonte ( BH ) with 48 people ( 51.5 +/- 8.7 years ) and one from Montes Claros ( MC ) with 29 subjects ( 55.4 +/- 8.1 years ).
M	Subsequently , regardless of location , the groups were divided into Active and Insufficiently Active so their difference in terms of quality of life could be analyzed.
R	There were no significant differences between BH and MCG when it came to four dimensions of physical health that were evaluated ( physical functioning , physical aspect , pain and health status ) or in the following four dimensions of mental health status ( vitality , social aspect , emotional aspect and mental health ).
R	However , significantly higher mean values were found in Active when compared with Insufficiently Active individuals in various measures of physical health ( physical functioning 56.2 +/- 4.4 vs. 47.4 +/- 6.9 ; physical aspect 66.5 +/- 6.5 vs. 59.1 +/- 6.7 ; pain 55.9 +/- 6.2 vs. 47.7 +/- 6.0 ; health status 67.2 +/- 4.2 vs. 56.6 +/- 7.8 ) ( arbitrary units ) , and mental health ( vitality 60.9 +/- 6.8 vs. 54.1 +/- 7.2 ; social aspect 60.4 +/- 7.1 vs. 54.2 +/- 7.4 ; emotional aspect 64.0 +/- 5.5 vs. 58.1 +/- 6.9 ; mental health status 66.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 58.4 +/- 7.5 ) ( arbitrary units ).
C	Despite the difference between the cities concerning HDI values , no significant differences in quality of life were found between BH and MCG.
C	However , the Active group showed significantly better results , confirming the importance of active lifestyle to enhance quality of life in stroke survivors.
B	Medical decision-making has evolved to the modern model of shared decision-making among patients , surrogate decision-makers , and medical providers.
B	As such , informed consent discussions with critically ill patients often should include larger discussions relating to values and goals of care.
B	Documentation of care options and prognosis serves as an important component of electronic communication relating to patient preferences among care providers.
P	This retrospective chart review study sought to evaluate the prevalence of documentation of critical data , care options , prognosis , and medical plan , within primary team and palliative care consult team documentation.
R	Three hundred two electronic medical records were reviewed.
R	There was a significant difference in documentation between palliative care and primary teams for prognosis ( 83% vs 32% , P < .001 ) , care options ( 82% vs 50% , P < .001 ) , and care plan ( 82% vs 46% , P < .001 ).
C	Our retrospective chart review study demonstrated a significant difference in documentation between primary and palliative care teams.
C	We acknowledge that review of documentation cannot be extrapolated to the presence or absence of conversations between providers and patients and/or surrogates.
C	Additional studies to evaluate this connection would be advantageous.
B	Many health professionals engage in providing health services for drug users ; however , there is evidence of stigmatisation by some health professionals.
B	Prescription drug misusers as a specific group , may also be subject to such judgment.
B	This study aimed to understand issues for primary care health practitioners in relation to prescription drug misuse ( PDM ) , by exploring the attitudes and experiences of healthcare professionals with respect to PDM.
M	Tape-recorded interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of general practitioners ( 17 ) , community pharmacists ( 16 ) and 'key experts' ( 18 ) in New Zealand.
M	Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis undertaken.
M	Participants were offered vouchers to the value of NZ$30 for their participation.
R	A major theme that was identified was that of two different types of patients involved in PDM , as described by participants - the 'abuser' and the 'overuser'.
R	The 'abuser' was believed to acquire prescription medicines through deception for their own use or for selling on to the illicit market , to use the drugs recreationally , for a 'high' or to stave off withdrawal from illicit drugs.
R	'Overusers' were characterised as having become 'addicted' through inadvertent overuse and over prescribing , and were generally viewed more sympathetically by practitioners.
R	It also emerged that practitioners' attitudes may have impacted on whether any harm reduction interventions might be offered.
R	Furthermore , whilst practitioners might be more willing to offer help to the 'over-user' , it seemed that there is a lack of appropriate services for this group , who may also lack a peer support network.
C	A binary view of PDM may not be helpful in understanding the issues surrounding PDM , nor in providing appropriate interventions.
C	There is a need for further exploration of 'over users' whose needs may not be being met by mainstream drug services , and issues of stigma in relation to 'abusers'.
B	Caregiving across different cultures has been perceived conventionally as a private or family responsibility , predominantly performed by women who accept their caregiving as part of their gender role.
P	This study aimed to design , deliver , and evaluate an elderly training programme for women by assessing their knowledge , attitudes and skills as a lay caregiver.
P	Encouraging the women to find suitable positions for employment in private or governmental institutions was the further objective of the study.
M	The study was a quasi-experimental one-group pre-test post-test design.
M	The study was conducted in a solidarity centre for women and in a nursing home for the elderly.
M	The sample covered 120 women selected from the community by convenience sampling.
M	Data were gathered through pre- and post-test evaluation and observation forms in 2 May-22 December 2005.
M	The training programme consisted of 230 h of didactic sessions , demonstrations and clinical practices.
R	The mean change in the participants' knowledge score ( pre-test: 41.44 +/- 0.92 ; post-test: 71.16 +/- 1.34 ) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in their knowledge.
R	According to clinical observations , most of them displayed satisfactory caring and communication skills towards the elderly.
R	Virtually all participants reported increased skill , knowledge and confidence.
C	The developed training programme was effective , resulting in an increased knowledge , the acquisition of good attitudes towards the elderly , and performing satisfactory caring and communication skills.
C	Similar community-based programmes managed by nurses are recommended to support non-professional caregivers.
C	The research is not only an innovative but also a revolutionary model to promote women.
B	Menarche is an important indicator for assessing the developmental status of pubertal girls.
B	Despite its importance , there is no nationwide information on menarcheal age in Turkey.
P	This paper is the first attempt to examine age at menarche for Turkey as a whole.
P	The aim is to present the secular trend of menarcheal age and variations across different socio-demographic groups.
M	Data were employed from the Turkey Demographic and Health Survey , 2008.
M	Mean menarcheal ages were estimated for birth cohorts and socio-demographic subgroups.
M	The pace of decline in menarcheal age has been estimated using multiple linear regression analysis , controlling for year of birth and other variables.
R	Mean age at menarche was estimated as 13.30 ( 95% CI - 13.26-13.35 ).
R	It was estimated as 13.17 years ( 95% CI 12.95-13.38 ) for the youngest birth cohort ( 1989-1993 ) , as opposed to 13.44 ( 95% CI 13.37-13.52 ) years for the cohort born in 1959-1968.
C	Regression analysis indicated a decrease of 1.44 months per decade , providing evidence of a secular trend in menarcheal age in Turkey.
C	Further results suggested childhood place of residence , education , welfare status and number of siblings to be significantly associated with menarcheal age.
B	The provision of dental care for children with intellectual disability raises many ethical questions.
P	The aim of this qualitative study was to explore approaches to dental treatment in an anxious child with intellectual disability and the ethical dilemmas that ensue.
M	Semi-structured interviews were conducted between February and May 2012.
M	A clinical scenario was used to establish a starting point for a discussion of the clinical approach and lead to an ethical reflection.
M	Four topics were discussed: first contact with the patient , information , attitude towards the patient and outcome from the practitioner's viewpoint.
M	The coding procedure used thematic content analysis.
R	Most practitioners fetched the patient from the waiting room personally , greeted them , gave them special attention , and either began the consultation at once , or used distraction to relax the patient.
R	Verbal language and tell-show-do were most often used to provide information.
R	Anxiety and pain were evaluated using parental assessment and standardized scales.
R	A reassuring attitude was adopted.
R	An ethical dilemma arose if the patient refused care or had to be restrained.
R	Practitioners reported sacrificing ethical values ( patient autonomy , beneficence and non-maleficence ) when making a clinical decision.
C	There is a wide range of practices but no consensus.
C	This study shed some light on the different perspectives of dentists , most of whom adopted a utilitarianist viewpoint.
C	In this context , ethical reflection is necessary to avoid a detached attitude or , worse , abuse.
C	Further study would enrich this reflection.

P	The purpose of this article is to show case study research focused on persons as a case and our personal engagement with the case can improve our innerstandings and understanding of person-centred care.
M	We present the methodology and epistemology of naturalistic case study research and illuminate this approach with the case study of Ellen , a young , Dutch , white-middle class woman with a compulsive disorder.
M	We combine naturalistic case study research with the personal narratives of those involved in the research , including ourselves , and interpreted through a feminist and gender lens.
R	The case study research enhanced the personal and mutual understanding of all involved , including the researchers.
R	Feminist and gender theory revealed the hidden personal motif for the choice of the case , and led to a re-viewing of the original story , offering a re-storying.
C	We conclude that the personal motif as well as the use of our personal experiences to understand the case deserve more attention in case study research to address the complex interplay of social and intrapsychic dimensions , and develop more in-depth innerstandings for all engaged.
P	We review historical and more recent efforts in boredom research and related fields.
P	A framework is presented that organizes the various facets of boredom , particularly in supervisory control settings , and research gaps and future potential areas for study are highlighted.
B	Given the ubiquity of boredom across a wide spectrum of work environmentsexacerbated by increasingly automated systems that remove humans from direct , physical system interaction and possibly increasing tedium in the workplacethere is a need not only to better understand the multiple facets of boredom in work environments but to develop targeted mitigation strategies.
M	To better understand the relationships between the various influences and outcomes of boredom , a systems-based framework , called the Boredom Influence Diagram , is proposed that describes various elements of boredom and their interrelationships.
R	Boredom is closely related to vigilance , attention management , and task performance.
R	This review highlights the need to develop more naturalistic experiments that reflect the characteristics of a boring work environment.
C	With the increase in automation , boredom in the workplace will likely become a more prevalent issue for motivation and retention.
C	In addition , developing continuous measures of boredom based on physiological signals is critical.
C	Personnel selection and improvements in system and task design can potentially mitigate boredom.
C	However , more work is needed to develop and evaluate other potential interventions.
P	This study examined child production of narrative features and of African American English ( AAE ) during a wordless storybook oral narrative task.
M	Participants were 30 AAE-speaking African American kindergarten and 1st grade students from low- and mid-socioeconomic status homes.
M	Story grammar ( SG ) , story literary technique ( SLT ) , and AAE features were examined.
R	Young AAE-speaking students used a variety of SG narrative features to develop the plot in their oral stories.
R	Students also used multiple SLT elaborative features , though some techniques were used more frequently than others.
R	The total SLT score positively predicted the total SG score , and the individual SLTs of adverbs or adjectives , references to the main theme , and character interactions were positively correlated with the total SG score.
R	AAE-feature production rates did not predict the total SG score.
R	However , several individual AAE features served specific narrative functions , with the preterite had , zero past tense , zero preposition , fitna/sposeta/bouta , and double marking features often being used to relay complicating actions within the narratives.
C	Young children used both AAE and elaborative features in their narratives.
C	Particular AAE features facilitated plot development , and the use of more elaborative features positively predicted higher narrative development scores.
B	Mental disorder implies a biopsychosocial condition , so adequate mental health treatment involves not just medical and pharmacological care but also psychotherapy or counseling.
P	The present study determined how social structural factors might explain accessing of primary care providers and specialty care providers in response to mental disorder , hypothesizing that the two broad types of care differ as to the likelihood of offering minimally adequate treatment.
M	We analyzed data from the cross-sectional study called "2000-2001 Healthcare for Communities" , employing five imputed data sets to handle missing data and defining minimally adequate treatment of mental disorder as "at least four counseling sessions at any provider and prescribed medication".
R	While mental disorder can be treated in primary care or specialty facilities , our results show that minimally adequate treatment ( as defined ) is most likely to be obtained via specialty care.
C	For individuals with mental disorder , accessing only primary care creates social inequity , because care from specialty facilities is comparatively more adequate.
B	One essential element of research is the successful recruitment of participants.
B	However , concerns are obvious regarding the ethical implications of involving terminally ill and even dying patients and their informal caregivers as research participants.
B	This study aims to illustrate central issues encountered when recruiting bereaved informal caregivers for a questionnaire validation study on the quality of dying and death.
M	Between July 2012 and November 2013 , informal caregivers of deceased inpatients who were treated at two palliative care units in Germany were invited to participate in a questionnaire validation study.
M	Informal caregivers were called by a trained researcher at the end of the fourth week after death at the earliest and by the sixteenth week after death at the latest and asked to participate in a face-to-face interview in their private home.
R	The overall participation rate of all eligible informal caregivers was 76.1% ( 226/297 ).
R	The mean burden score was 2.5 ( NRS from 0 = no burden to 10 = maximum burden ; n = 221 ).
R	Higher burden scores ( >= 4 ) were associated with emotional and burdensome memories ( n = 34 ) being invoked throughout the interview.
R	Severe or maximum burden scores ( >= 7 ) were stated by 13.2% of participants.
R	The average time between the associated patient's death and the informal caregiver's interview was 57.3 days ( range 26-176 days , median 49.5 days ).
R	5.3% of all 226 interviews were not completed due to different reasons.
R	Participants' comments on the way in which the study was conducted gave insight into their motivation to take part in the study and their evaluation of the interview situation.
C	The recruitment strategy can be recommended to other researchers developing research with bereaved carers.
C	The burden caused by study participation was acceptable to the researchers carrying out this research , although a small group of participants experienced high levels of burden which should be anticipated and appropriate support services offered.
C	Family caregivers are willing to support end-of-life care research , have different motivations for participation and even reported benefits from participation.
C	Nevertheless , study designs have to take into account and ease the potential burden of interviews for caregivers experiencing grief.
B	Human health is dependent upon environmental sustainability.
B	Many have argued that environmental sustainability advocacy and environmentally responsible healthcare practice are imperative healthcare actions.
P	What are the key obstacles to healthcare professionals supporting environmental sustainability?
P	How may these obstacles be overcome?
M	Data-driven thematic qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews identified common and pertinent themes , and differences between specific healthcare disciplines.
M	A total of 64 healthcare professionals and academics from all states and territories of Australia , and multiple healthcare disciplines were recruited.
M	Institutional ethics approval was obtained for data collection.
M	Participants gave informed consent.
M	All data were de-identified to protect participant anonymity.
R	Qualitative analysis indicated that Australian healthcare professionals often take more action in their personal than professional lives to protect the environment , particularly those with strong professional identities.
R	The healthcare sector's focus on economic rationalism was a substantial barrier to environmentally responsible behaviour.
R	Professionals also feared conflict and professional ostracism , and often did not feel qualified to take action.
R	This led to healthcare professionals making inconsistent moral judgements , and feeling silenced and powerless.
R	Constraints on non-clinical employees within and beyond the sector exacerbated these difficulties.
C	The findings are consistent with the literature reporting that organisational constraints , and strong social identification , can inhibit actions that align with personal values.
C	This disparity can cause moral distress and residue , leading to feelings of powerlessness , resulting in less ethical behaviour.
C	The data highlight a disparity between personal and professional actions to address environmental sustainability.
C	Given the constraints Australian healthcare professionals encounter , they are unlikely to shift to environmentally responsible practice without support from institutions and professional associations.
C	Professional development is required to support this endeavour.
C	The poor transference of pro-ecological behaviour from one setting to another is likely to have international implications for healthcare practice.
B	Poisoning that occurs as the result using alcohol or drugs for recreational purposes or to induce rewarding psychoactive effects ( "recreational poisoning" ) represents significant harm attributed to drug use.
B	There has been limited focus on recreational poisoning separately from hospital admissions for general harms related to alcohol or drug use.
B	This study aims to detail the drug trends and patient population represented in recreational poisonings in Newcastle , Australia.
M	Naturalistic analysis of consecutive hospital presentations following poisoning between January , 1996 and December , 2013 was conducted using data from the Hunter Area Toxicology Service ( HATS ).
M	13805 patient records were included ( aged 18-98 ) , 1209 ( 8.8% ) of those were recreational poisonings.
R	Compared to non-recreational poisonings , recreational poisonings were more likely to occur in males than females ( OR=2.87 , 95% CI: 2.44-3.40 , p < 0.001 ) and in patients under the age of 30 compared to their older counterparts ( OR=1.58 , 95% CI: 1.35-1.85 ,p < 0.001 ).
R	Hospital presentations for recreational poisonings were more likely to occur between 0300 and 0600h than 0900-1700h ( OR=3.07 , 95% CI: 2.29-4.11 , p < 0.001 ) and more likely to occur on the weekend than on a Monday.
R	Overall , recreational poisoning admissions declined over time.
C	Overall , the trends reported in this analysis reflect general use and availability of alcohol and illicit substances in Australia over the time period.
C	Looking at specific sub-types of alcohol and drug-related harm , like poisoning , is important for service planning and government initiatives.

B	In 2010 , Greenland introduced the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( Prevnar 13 ( R ) - PCV-13 ) in the childhood immunisation program.
B	The authors aimed to evaluate the impact of PCV-13 on nasopharyngeal carriage of bacteria frequently associated with respiratory infections in children.
M	In 2013 a cross-sectional population-based study of nasopharyngeal carriage was conducted among Greenlandic children aged 0-6 years and results were compared with an equivalent study from 2011.
M	Nasopharyngeal swab samples were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae , non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
M	Pneumococcal serotyping was performed by Quellung reaction and serotype-specific antisera.
M	Statistical analysis included logistic regression models , adjusting for known risk factors.
R	A total of 377 nasopharyngeal samples were collected.
R	Overall carriage rate of S. pneumoniae remained unchanged from 2011 to 2013 ( 51% and 56% , p=0.13 ) , but significant serotype shifts were observed among both vaccinated and unvaccinated children with marked reductions in carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci , counterbalanced by increasing carriage of non-vaccine types.
R	Carriage rate of S. aureus decreased significantly among vaccinated children whereas that of M. catarrhalis increased.
C	PCV-13 introduction in Greenland is associated with significant changes in nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage.
C	Continued surveillance is warranted to clarify whether these changes are persistent , and affect the pattern of respiratory and invasive diseases in Greenland.
B	Earlier studies in nursing homes show a high prevalence of cognitive impairment , dependency in activities of daily living ( ADL ) , pain , and neuropsychiatric symptoms among residents.
B	The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of the above among residents in a nationally representative sample of Swedish nursing homes , and to investigate whether pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms differ in relation to gender , cognitive function , ADL-capacity , type of nursing-home unit and length of stay.
M	Cross-sectional data from 188 randomly selected nursing homes were collected.
M	A total of 4831 residents were assessed for cognitive and ADL function , pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
M	Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and the chi-square test.
R	The results show the following: the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 67 % , 56 % of residents were ADL-dependent , 48 % exhibited pain and 92 % exhibited neuropsychiatric symptoms.
R	The prevalence of pain did not differ significantly between male and female residents , but pain was more prevalent among cognitively impaired and ADL-dependent residents.
R	Pain prevalence was not significantly different between residents in special care units for people with dementia ( SCU ) and general units , or between shorter-and longer-stay residents.
R	Furthermore , the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms did not differ significantly between male and female residents , between ADL capacities or in relation to length of stay.
R	However , residents with cognitive impairment and residents in SCUs had a significantly higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms than residents without cognitive impairment and residents in general units.
C	The prevalence rates ascertained in this study could contribute to a greater understanding of the needs of nursing-home residents , and may provide nursing home staff and managers with trustworthy assessment scales and benchmark values for further quality assessment purposes , clinical development work and initiating future nursing assessments.
P	As precision medicine continues its expansion into clinical practice and research settings , it is time to investigate genetic and genomic research in the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) region to identify the strengths and deficits and to provide suggestions for future development.
M	We performed a literature review of any genetic or genomic publications on breast cancer and type 2 diabetes for the years 2000-2015 and evaluated the translational value of the research using multiple evaluation metrics , including the "continuum of translation" and the Health Impact Pyramid.
R	A total of 138 type 2 diabetes and 231 breast cancer publications were included.
R	There were few cohort studies or randomized controlled trials , and there was a distinct lack of pharmacogenetic or pharmacogenomic papers.
R	Most studies were not interventional but instead evaluated susceptibility , and when placed on the continuum of translation , more than 90% of the studies were T1.
C	This study suggests that the translational value of genetic and genomic research in the MENA region is currently suboptimal.
C	Moving forward requires international cooperation and a collaborative cohort program in order to implement precision medicine in this area of the world.

P	The current study examined gender and racial/ethnic ( Hispanics , non-Hispanic Caucasians , non-Hispanic African Americans , and non-Hispanic Asians ) differences in developmental trajectories of alcohol use , heavy drinking , smoking , and marijuana use from early adolescence to young adulthood using a nationally representative sample.
M	Participants from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( N = 20 ,160 ) reported rates of alcohol use , heavy drinking , smoking , and marijuana use between the ages of 12 and 34 years.
M	Data analyses were completed using longitudinal multilevel modeling analyses.
R	Levels of substance use increased from early adolescence to mid-20s , and then declined thereafter.
R	Females showed higher levels of substance use in early adolescence , although males exhibited greater changes overtime and higher levels of use in mid-adolescence and early adulthood.
R	Overall , Hispanic youth had higher initial rates of substance use , whereas Caucasian adolescents showed higher rates of change and had the highest levels of substance use from mid-adolescence through the early 30s.
R	Racial/ethnic differences largely disappeared after age 30 , except that African Americans showed higher final levels of smoking and marijuana use than the other racial/ethnic groups.
R	Results provide evidence for both similarities and differences in general patterns of development and in gender and racial/ethnic differences across different forms of substance use.
C	Findings from the current study suggest that the critical periods for intervention and prevention of substance use may differ across gender and race/ethnicity , and that future research needs to identify common and unique mechanisms underlying developmental patterns of different forms of substance use.

P	This study examined past tense marking by African American English ( AAE )-speaking children from low-and middle-income backgrounds to determine if poverty affects children's marking of past tense in ways that mirror the clinical condition of specific language impairment ( SLI ).
M	Participants were 15 AAE-speaking 6-year-olds from low-income backgrounds , 15 AAE-speaking 6-year-olds from middle-income backgrounds who served as age-matched controls , and 15 AAE-speaking 5-year-olds from middle-income backgrounds who served as language-matched controls.
M	Data were drawn from language samples and probes.
R	Results revealed high rates of regular marking , variable rates of irregular marking , high rates of over-regularizations , and absence of dialect-inappropriate errors of commission.
R	For some analyses , marking was affected by the phonological characteristics of the items and the children's ages , but none of the analyses revealed effects for the children's socioeconomic level.
C	Within AAE , poverty status as a variable affects past tense marking in ways that are different from the clinical condition of SLI.
B	The aim of the study was to compare how alcohol was addressed in routine healthcare practice in Sweden in 2010 and 2017 , following the 2011 implementation of national drinking guidelines.
M	Population-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2010 and in 2017.
M	Subjects were 3200 respondents in 2010 ( response rate 54% ) and 3000 respondents in 2017 ( response rate 51% ) in Sweden.
M	Both the 2010 and 2017 surveys collected data on: socio-demographics ; alcohol consumption ; healthcare visits in the past 12 months and characteristics of alcohol conversations in healthcare ( duration , contents , experience and effects ).
R	It was significantly more likely that respondents had a conversation about alcohol in healthcare in 2017 than in 2010 ( OR = 1.49 ; 95% CI = 1.27-1.75 ; P<0.001 ).
R	Conversations about alcohol in the healthcare were mostly short ( <4 min ) , both in 2010 and 2017.
R	The alcohol conversations in 2017 included less information about alcohol's influence on health ( P = 0.002 ) compared with 2010.
R	The experience of the conversation about alcohol was perceived as less dramatic in 2017 than in 2010 ( P = 0.038 ).
C	The results suggest that conversations about alcohol were more embedded in routine healthcare practice in Sweden in 2017 than in 2010.
C	This development has occurred since the 2011 publication of the national guidelines.
C	Alcohol conversations targeted also specific groups of drinkers as recommended by the guidelines.
C	However , our study design does not allow for conclusions about the relationship between the guidelines and the changes in healthcare practice.
B	Technology and social media offer individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities ( I/DD ) unique and innovative ways to facilitate active participation in their own healthcare process.
B	What remains unclear is the extent to which devices are currently used by this growing patient population.
P	To explore the prevalence of technology and social media use , as well as the possible barriers , among adult patients with I/DD.
M	A cross-sectional study utilizing an anonymous , accessible survey was used to obtain data from all adult patients ( 18 + years of age ) with I/DD presenting for primary care services at a healthcare facility in New York between September and December of 2016.
R	A total of 370 individuals completed the survey ( 529 approached , 69.9% response rate ).
R	Less than half ( 44.6% ) of respondents used devices such as a tablet , smartphone or desktop ; most ( 86.8% ) did not use social media.
R	Only 21.6% of respondents indicated that they use some type of assistive technology.
R	While some respondents ( 46.0% ) were identified by their caregivers as having a disability that would prevent them from learning/using technology , other respondents reported having no challenges ( 18.0% ) , needing training and/or ongoing support ( 7.4% ) , or being uncertain as to whether they would experience any challenges ( 15.5% ).
C	Many adult patients with I/DD do not use technology and social media that could promote self-determination and participation in their healthcare.
C	Continued efforts must be made to promote technology use among adults with I/DD and to ensure that appropriate training is available for both the individual and his/her caregivers to achieve adoption and utilization.

B	The measurement of depression severity is an important aspect of both clinical and research practices.
B	However , studies examining the self-report Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) and the clinician Hamilton Depression Rating Scale indicate only moderate correlations.
B	The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between two self-report measures , the revised BDI , the Hopkins Symptom Checklist with the clinician rated , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
B	The secondary aim was to investigate patient factors which contribute to discordant ratings.
M	Depression severity and demographic , clinical , personality , cognitive , and personality factors that may contribute to a self-report-clinician rated discrepancy were examined in 177 adult outpatients with a Major Depressive Episode ( DSM-IV ) participating in a randomised clinical trial comparing CBT and IPT for depression.
M	All assessment was conducted prior to treatment randomisation.
R	Self-report and clinician rated depression were moderately correlated.
R	Individuals with higher clinician rated depression severity , increased levels of rumination and females were more likely to have higher self-report rated depression ( BDI-II and SCL-90 ) than clinician rated depression.
R	In addition , younger patients and those with melancholic depression had higher BDI-II compared to MADRS scores.
C	Results require replication.
C	Self-reported and observer rated depression were only moderately correlated.
C	Researchers and clinicians interpreting the level of depression need to be cognizant of the patient factors that may contribute to either underreporting or overreporting self-report scores relative to observer ratings.

B	Improving pathways into care is an important part of government policy on delivering equitable care and treatment for the BME community.
B	As part of EPIC Easington Mental Health services agreed to participate in the project to increase the level of self seeking behaviour at the point prior to accessing to our services for the Chinese community in order to reduce fear , increase satisfaction with services and ensure our workforce was capable of delivering appropriate and responsive care.
B	Project
M	A literature search , community development approach and clinical pathway of care identified the key aims of the project.
M	Four 'work streams' were identified each with agreed overall aims and outcomes with the project group steering implementation.
R	There was recognition at commencement that key outcomes would be difficult to quantify and the project would continue outside the parameters however we were able to demonstrate improvement as a result of the project and identify key learning points.
B	Many health technology assessment ( HTA ) agencies express a preference for randomized controlled trial evidence when appraising health technologies ; nevertheless , it is not always feasible or ethical to conduct such comparative trials.
P	To assess the role of noncomparative evidence in HTA decision making.
P	METHODS:The Web sites of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) in the United Kingdom , the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health ( CADTH ) in Canada , and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care ( Institut fur Qualitat und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen [IQWiG] ) in Germany were searched for single HTA reports ( published between January 2010 and December 2015 ).
P	The product , indication , outcome , and clinical evidence presented ( comparative/noncomparative ) were double-extracted , with any discrepancies reconciled.
P	A noncomparative study was defined as any study not presenting results against another treatment ( including placebo or best supportive care ) , regardless of phase or setting , including dose-ranging studies.
R	A total of 549 appraisals were extracted.
R	Noncomparative evidence was considered in 38% ( 45 of 118 ) of NICE submissions , 13% ( 34 of 262 ) of CADTH submissions , and 12% ( 20 of 169 ) of IQWiG submissions.
R	Evidence submissions based exclusively on noncomparative evidence were presented in only 4% ( 5 of 118 ) of NICE appraisals , 6% ( 16 of 262 ) of CADTH appraisals , and 4% ( 6 of 169 ) of IQWiG appraisals.
R	Most drugs appraised solely on the basis of noncomparative evidence were indicated for cancer or hepatitis C. Positive outcome rates ( encompassing recommended/restricted/added-benefit decisions ) for submissions presenting only noncomparative evidence were similar to overall recommendation rates for CADTH ( 69% vs. 68% , respectively ) , but were numerically lower for NICE ( 60% vs. 84% , respectively ) and IQWiG ( 17% vs. 38% , respectively ) ( P > 0.05 for all ).
C	Noncomparative studies can be viewed as acceptable clinical evidence by HTA agencies when these study designs are justifiable and when treatment effect can be convincingly demonstrated , but their use is currently limited.
B	Sweden has a high percentage of foreign-born residents ( 18.5 % ) and one of the highest overdose death rates in Europe.
B	For immigrant parents with risky substance use ( RSU ) , risk factors associated with immigration status ( e.g. , economic strain and psychological stress ) potentially heightening the risk of involvement with the child welfare system ( CWS ).
B	Using Swedish registry national data , this study explored the relationship between immigration-country of birth status , psychosocial risk factors , and child compulsory care for parents with RSU.
M	Study sample consisted of 5932 parents from 65 Swedish municipalities assessed for psychosocial problems ( including alcohol and drug use ) using the Addiction Severity Index ( 2007-2017 ).
M	Stepwise multinomial logistic regression models examined the relationship between immigration-country of birth status ( Swedish born , Nordic-born , and non-Nordic born ) , psychosocial problems , and compulsory care in the CWS.
R	Compared to Swedish-born parents , parents not born in Sweden , Norway , Denmark or Finland ( non-Nordic born parents ) had a lower probability of children living in compulsory care ( family homes or institutions ).
R	However , after accounting for psychosocial problems , immigration status was no longer significantly associated with children's living arrangements.
C	Study findings indicate that parental immigrant status ( even among parents dealing with RSU ) in itself is not a risk factor for compulsory care in the CWS.
C	Moreover , parental employment and health problems posed greater risk for children being in compulsory care.
C	Receipt of targeted services for employment and health problems may help to maintain stable child living arrangements for immigrant parents dealing with RSU.
B	Cognitive deficits , especially in memory and concentration , are often reported during pregnancy.
B	Similar cognitive dysfunctions can also occur in depression and anxiety.
B	To date , few studies have investigated the associations between cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy.
B	This field is of interest because maternal cognitive functioning , and particularly its higher-order aspects are related to maternal wellbeing and caregiving behavior , as well as later child development.
M	Pregnant women ( N =230 ) , reporting low ( n =87 ) , moderate ( n =97 ) , or high ( n =46 ) levels of depressive , general anxiety and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms ( assessed repeatedly with EPDS , SCL-90/anxiety subscale , PRAQ-R2 , respectively ) were tested in mid-pregnancy for their cognitive functions.
M	A computerized neuropsychological test battery was used.
R	Pregnant women with high or moderate level of psychiatric symptoms had significantly more errors in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning task than mothers with low symptom level.
R	Depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy and concurrent pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were significant predictors of the performance in the task.
R	General anxiety symptoms were not related to visuospatial working memory.
C	Cognitive functions were evaluated only at one time-point during pregnancy precluding causal conclusions.
C	Maternal depressive symptoms and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were both associated with decrements in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning.
C	Depressive symptoms seem to present more stable relationship with cognitive deficits , while pregnancy-related anxiety was associated only concurrently.
C	Future studies could investigate , how stable these cognitive differences are , and whether they affect maternal ability to deal with demands of pregnancy and later parenting.
P	The public has long had misconceptions about traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and its effects.
P	Concussion education targeted toward athletes has been increasing with passage of return-to-play laws in all 50 states.
P	The current study examined differences in public knowledge about TBI and concussion , and the extent to which students and parents in the general public may have benefited from increased availability of education around concussion.
M	At a public fair , 246 students , parents , and other adults completed a survey adapted from existing TBI and concussion knowledge surveys.
M	Participants also rated their confidence in accuracy of their responses.
R	There were no group differences on TBI knowledge or confidence.
R	Parents scored slightly higher on concussion knowledge than students , and knowing someone with a TBI or concussion was also associated with higher scores.
R	Confidence was only weakly related to concussion knowledge.
R	Overall concussion knowledge scores were higher than TBI knowledge scores.
R	Knowledge and confidence were not associated with sports participation.
C	Given similarities in TBI knowledge across groups , but that parents outpace students in concussion knowledge , parents may have greater exposure or heightened awareness of concussion information education opportunities.
C	Lower confidence in students suggests an openness to education and opportunities for prevention of injuries.
P	The purpose of this study was to describe the lived experience of patients with heart transplantation in Korea.
M	Individual indepth interviews and a focus group interview were used to collect the data from nine patients who had heart transplantations in 2015.
M	All interviews were audio-taped and verbatim transcripts were made for the analysis.
M	Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method.
R	Among the nine participants , eight were men.
R	Mean age was 57.30 years.
R	Six theme clusters emerged from the analysis.
R	'Joy of rebirth obtained by good luck' describes the pleasure and expectation of new life after narrow survival.
R	'Suffering from adverse drug effects' illustrates various psychosocial difficulties , such as low self-esteem , helplessness , alienation , and burnout , arising from the side effects of medications.
R	`Body and mind of being bewildered' illustrates disintegrated health and haunting fear of death.
R	'Alienation disconnected with society' describes isolated feeling of existence due to misunderstandings from society.
R	'Suffering overcome with gratitude and responsibility' includes overcoming experience through various social supports and suitable jobs.
R	Finally , 'acceptance of suffering accompanied with new heart' illustrate changed perspective of life itself.
C	The findings in this study provide deep understanding and insights of the lived experience of heart related illness for these patients and should help in the development of tailored-interventions for patients with heart transplantation.
B	Conducting federally mandated community health needs assessments through academic-practice partnerships provides new opportunities for developing population health nursing competencies.
P	The purpose of this article was to describe how a baccalaureate practicum experience within such an assessment process , involving health care system partners , re-affirms the importance of community and population health assessment in the development of future nursing leaders.
R	Student evaluations indicated an emerging appreciation for the social determinants of health , the power of partnerships , and the importance of diversity.
R	Integrating health care and public health system perspectives on assessment meets both public health and nursing accreditation standards and extends student leadership experiences.
R	Such integration also improves regional capacity for improving population health.
C	Federal mandates for community health needs assessments provide opportunities to advance leadership roles for nursing graduates throughout the health care system , and for confirming the importance of community assessment as an essential nursing competency.
P	The paper summarizes the research which has thus far explored the efficacy of online peer support services for people with depression and raises important questions for consideration of future research.
M	Published literature on online peer support services for people with depression.
C	Online peer support services can provide many advantages for people living with depression.
C	However , given the limited empirical evidence of the efficacy of online peer support services specifically for depression , future research is required to substantiate the anecdotal evidence of these services.
C	Obtaining a greater understanding of such services will facilitate the development of more effective and meaningful services to assist those living with depression.
B	Strategic purchasing has been introduced as a key strategy for solving the problems faced by insurance companies.
B	In Iran , the government has mandated the Iran Health Insurance Organization ( IHIO ) to implement this strategy.
B	However , there are serious challenges to achieving that.
B	The present study aims to identify these challenges.
M	In this qualitative study , a semi-structured interview was conducted on 27 health managers and experts at the national level.
M	The dimensions of the A. Preker model were used to analyze the data.
R	Challenges of strategic purchasing in the IHIO were categorized into five concepts-political economy , policy design , organizational structure , organizational environment , and management capacity ; within these concepts , 22 challenges were identified.
C	Improving strategic purchasing in Iran requires adopting a coherent approach and taking into account all the affecting factors.
C	By revising some policies , and modifying and defining the rules needed to solve the infrastructural problems , the success of strategic purchasing can be obtained.
B	A workflow process mapping approach was previously developed to understand the impact of primary care medication use processes on medication safety.
B	The workflow process mapping approach was applied to a pilot project in one primary care practice.
P	The objective of this article is to: ( 1 ) exemplify how workflow process mapping was implemented in one primary care practice to characterize medication safety issues ( i.e. , critical workflow gaps/deviations ) , ( 2 ) discuss the identified critical medication safety workflow gaps and deviations , and ( 3 ) summarize the pragmatic , practice-level recommendations developed to enhance practice-level medication safety.
M	Four medication-related activities were directly observed , including: ( 1 ) medication reconciliation , ( 2 ) warfarin medication management , ( 3 ) vaccination administration , and ( 4 ) medication renewal requests.
M	Observations occurred with registered nurses , medical assistants , and telephone operators.
M	An ideal-state and observed workflow process map was created for each medication-related activity and was compared to identify critical medication safety workflow gaps and deviations.
M	Practice-level recommendations were developed to enhance workflow and medication safety across all medication-related activities.
R	111 medication-related observations were recorded over 6-weeks across all 4 workflows ( 100 observation hours ).
R	A total of 17 critical workflow safety gaps , 9 critical workflow step deviations , and 9 workflow sequence deviations were identified.
R	Seventy-six percent of total workflow gaps resulted from inappropriate medication verification.
R	Most workflow step deviations ( 33% ) were due to inappropriate documentation , whereas most sequence deviations ( 44% ) stemmed from inadequate medication verification.
R	Practice-level recommendations to enhance warfarin medication safety were prioritized and implemented prior to the completion of the pilot project.
C	The results of this workflow mapping pilot project exemplify the need to enhance primary care medication safety for workflows conducted by non-provider staff members in primary care practices.
C	Additionally , this approach can be used to identify opportunities for primary care pharmacist integration , particularly for practices with little or no prior pharmacist involvement.
B	Conflicting results regarding associations of time trade-off ( TTO ) valuations with respondent characteristics have been reported , mostly on the basis of regression analyses.
B	Alternative approaches , such as the latent class analysis ( LCA ) , may add to the further understanding of variations in TTO responses.
P	To identify whether subgroups of respondents can be identified on the basis of their responses to TTO exercises and to investigate which respondent characteristics are associated with membership of the identified subgroups.
M	Members of the Dutch general public , aged 18 to 65 years , completed a Web-based questionnaire concerning sociodemographic characteristics , three TTO exercises valuing health states described using the domains of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire , and preference for quality versus quantity of life.
M	LCA was used to identify patterns in the responses.
M	Predictive variables were included in the final LCA model to identify the particular respondent characteristics that predict subgroup membership.
R	The sample consisted of 1067 respondents.
R	Four latent classes were identified in the responses to TTO exercises.
R	Two were high traders , focusing on quality of life and trading off a relatively high number of years.
R	The other two were low traders , focusing on length of life.
R	Predictive analyses revealed significant differences between subgroups in terms of age , sex , subjective life expectancy , and preference for quantity over quality of life.
C	We showed that distinct classes of respondents can be discerned in TTO responses from the general public , distinguishing subgroups of low and high traders.
C	More research in this area should confirm our findings and investigate their implications for health state valuation exercises.

P	The purpose of this study is to translate the Penn Shoulder Score into Turkish and to establish its cultural adaptation , reliability , and validity in patients with shoulder dysfunctions.
M	The Penn Shoulder Score was translated and culturally adapted from English into Turkish.
M	Subsequently , the Penn Shoulder Score , the Constant Score , the American Shoulder and Elbow Score , and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index were completed by 97 patients with shoulder dysfunctions.
M	To determine the test-retest reliability , 30 patients completed the Penn Shoulder Score again on day 3.
M	Intraclass correlation coefficient and Cronbach alpha were calculated to assess reliability.
M	The validity of the questionnaire was assessed in terms of convergent validity with Pearson Correlation Coefficient using the Constant Score , the American Shoulder and Elbow Score , and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index.
R	Internal consistency was good , with a Cronbach alpha of 0.81.
R	The Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.90 ( 95% confidence interval: 0.78 , 0.90 ) , demonstrating good test-retest reliability.
R	Pearson correlation coefficients of the Penn Shoulder Score in relation with the Constant Score , the American Shoulder and Elbow Score , and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index were 0.65 , 0.78 , and -0.77 , respectively.
C	The Turkish version of the Penn Shoulder Score is a reliable and valid measure for assessing patients with shoulder dysfunctions.
B	Oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) is characterised as a recurrent pattern of defiant behaviour towards authority figures , irritability and difficulties in regulating emotions.
B	ODD in adolescents presents similar symptomatology to borderline personality disorder ( BPD ).
B	A treatment programme that has been shown to be effective for treating problems related to emotion dysregulation such as BPD is dialectical behavioural therapy ( DBT ).
B	The aim of this article is to outline a case series in which we applied DBT to two adolescents diagnosed with ODD , in addition to psychiatric comorbidity and parasuicidal behaviours.
M	We applied a training programme of 24 sessions in DBT skills , along with individual therapy.
R	The results showed a decrease in impulsive behaviours , maladaptive behaviours to regulate affect , self-mutilation behaviour , number of hospitalisations , anger and depressive symptoms.
R	The data also showed an increase in positive emotions.
C	These results suggest that DBT can be an alternative for the treatment of ODD in adolescents with psychiatric comorbidity and parasuicidal behaviours.
B	Recent empirical studies stress the impact of features related to the small-area context on individual health.
B	However , so far there exists no standard explanatory model that integrates the different kinds of such features and that conceptualises their relation to individual characteristics of social inequality.
M	A review of theoretical publications on the relationship between social position and health as well as existing conceptual models for the impact of features related to the small-area context on health was undertaken.
R	In the present article we propose a conceptual model for the health impact of the small-area context.
R	This model conceptualises the location of residence as one dimension of social inequality that affects health through the resources as well as stressors which are inherent in the small-area context.
C	The proposed conceptual model offers an orientation for future empirical studies and can serve as a basis for further discussions concerning the health relevance of the small-area context.
B	Cigarette smoking has been shown to act as a 'gateway' to cannabis use and further risk taking behaviours.
B	This study aims to ( 1 ) establish the prevalence of cigarette smoking and cannabis use in Irish teenagers , ( 2 ) to quantify the strength and significance of the association of cigarette smoking and cannabis use and other high risk behaviours and ( 3 ) examine whether the above associations are independent of the extent of social networking.
M	Adolescent students across five urban , non-fee paying schools completed an abridged European schools survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( ESPAD ) questionnaire.
R	370/417 ( 88.7% ) students completed the questionnaire.
R	228 ( 61.6% ) were female , 349 ( 94.3% ) were aged 15-16 years.
R	48.4% of those surveyed had smoked tobacco at some stage in their lifetime , 18.1% in the last 30 days.
R	15.1% have used cannabis with 5.7% using it in the last 30 days.
R	29.6% of cigarette smokers have used cannabis in comparison to 1.6% of non-smokers.
R	On multivariate analysis lifetime cigarette smoking status was independently associated with hard drug use , adjusted OR = 6.0 , p < 0.01: soft drug use , adjusted OR = 4.6 , p < 0.01 and high risk sex practises , adjusted OR = 10.6 , p < 0.05.
C	Cigarette smoking prevalence remains high in Irish teenagers and is significantly associated with drug use and other risk taking behaviours.
C	Specific teenage smoking cessation strategies need to be developed targeting these combined high risk health behaviours.

B	The South African constitution protects the rights of gays ; however in the workplace gays experience discrimination and marginalization.
B	As a result of marginalization they struggle to reach their potential regarding career development and the fulfilment of their worker role.
P	The study explored the experiences and perceptions of gay males with regard to acquiring and maintaining their worker roles.
M	The study is phenomenological and qualitative in design.
M	Eleven of these men participated in two focus groups.
M	One male participated in two in-depth interviews and one interview was conducted with a key informant.
R	Three themes emerged: 1 ) Being boxed in , 2 ) The glass ceiling , 3 ) This is where I can wear my feather boa.
C	The study findings clearly depicted the many barriers experienced by homosexual men and how this negatively impacts on their worker role.
C	Minimal facilitatory factors exist , to assist gay males with regard to their worker role.
C	It was found that homo-prejudice still exists in South Africa and its workplaces and has a negative impact not only on gay men's worker role but also their well-being.
C	This significantly highlights the great need for occupational therapy intervention in the lives of these gay men , and their workplaces.
B	Despite increasing research on activity-based funding ( ABF ) , there is no empirical evidence on the accuracy of outpatient service data for payment.
P	This study aimed to identify data entry errors affecting ABF in two drug and alcohol outpatient clinic services in Australia.
M	An audit was carried out on healthcare workers' ( doctors , nurses , psychologists , social workers , counsellors , and aboriginal health education officers ) data entry errors in an outpatient electronic documentation system.
R	Of the 6919 data entries in the electronic documentation system , 7.5% ( 518 ) had errors , 68.7% of the errors were related to a wrong primary activity , 14.5% were due to a wrong activity category , 14.5% were as a result of a wrong combination of primary activity and modality of care , 1.9% were due to inaccurate information on a client's presence during service delivery and 0.4% were related to a wrong modality of care.
C	Data entry errors may affect the amount of funding received by a healthcare organisation , which in turn may affect the quality of treatment provided to clients due to the possibility of underfunding the organisation.
C	To reduce errors or achieve an error-free environment , there is a need to improve the naming convention of data elements , their descriptions and alignment with the national standard classification of outpatient services.
C	It is also important to support healthcare workers in their data entry by embedding safeguards in the electronic documentation system such as flags for inaccurate data elements.
B	Major depression is increasing world-wide , and is the fourth leading cause of the global disease burden.
B	Depression is rarely diagnosed in primary care settings in Vietnam , and those afflicted usually only seek professional care when the illness has become very severe.
B	Depressive disorders affecting mothers are an important cause of low birth-weight , childhood stunting , under nutrition and adverse mental development , and a study has shown a 33% prevalence of postnatal depression symptoms in Ho Chi Minh City.
M	The aim of this study was to elicit Illness Explanatory Models ( EMs ) of depression and postnatal depression from nine mothers and nine health workers.
M	The study was conducted in a semi-rural area in Vietnam , and the EMs were elicited through semi-structured interviews where a case vignette of depression was used as the basis of questioning.
R	The EMs elicited were predominantly somatosocial in nature and the mothers assigned a strong personal responsibility for care.
R	Psychiatric treatment and care was seldom recommended.
R	Lack of communication was described as an important factor concealing depression , and together with the lack of care-seeking can be expected to impede effective treatment.
C	The results of this study cannot be generalised beyond the group studied , or the context of Ba Vi , though we believe that analytical generalisation to other contexts can be made.
C	Conclusion ( clinical relevance ): The results of this study highlight the importance of depression and postnatal depression being diagnosed in primary care , and of a cross-sectoral approach for the prevention of depression in Vietnam , which takes into account the social causation of depression in women.

B	Prevalence rates of smoking in people with mental illness are high , and premature mortality attributed to tobacco related physical comorbidity is a major concern.
B	We conducted a meta-analysis comparing rates of receipt of smoking cessation advice among people with and without mental illness.
M	Major electronic databases were searched from inception till August 2014 for studies comparing rates of receipt of smoking cessation advice of people with and without a mental illness.
M	Two independent authors completed methodological appraisal and extracted data.
M	A random-effects meta-analysis was utilized.
R	Seven studies of satisfactory methodological quality ( n mental illness=68 ,811 , n control=652 ,847 ) were included.
R	Overall there was no significant difference in smoking cessation advice rates between those with and without a mental illness [relative risk ( RR )=1.02 , 95% confidence interval ( CI )=0.94-1.11 , n=721 ,658 , Q=1421 , Pb<.001].
R	Subgroup analyses demonstrated people with severe mental illness ( SMI ) received comparable rates of smoking cessation advice to those without SMI ( RR=1.09 , 95% CI=0.98-1.2 , n=559 ,122 ).
R	This remained true for people with schizophrenia ( RR=1.09 , 95% CI=0.68-1.70 ) and bipolar disorder ( RR=1.14 , 95% CI=0.85-1.5 ).
R	People with non-SMIs were slightly more likely to receive smoking cessation advice ( RR=1.16 , 95% CI=1.04-1.30 , Q=1364 , Pb<.001 , n=580 ,206 ).
C	People with SMI receive similar smoking cessation advice rates to people without mental illness , while those with non-SMI are slightly more likely to receive smoking cessation advice.
C	While progress has been made , offering smoking cessation advice should receive a higher priority in everyday clinical practice for patients with a mental health diagnosis.

B	Cardiac arrest ( CA ) is a leading cause of death worldwide.
B	The European Resuscitation Council ( ERC ) has developed basic life support/automated external defibrillation ( BLS/AED ) courses for uniform training in out-of-hospital CA.
P	The present study compares the resuscitation skills of two groups of nursing staff , one taught by newly trained ERC nurse-instructors and the other by newly trained doctor-instructors.
M	Eighteen doctors and 18 nurses were asked to teach a total of 108 nurses in a ( BLS/AED ) course.
M	One month after its completion , all 108 nurses were asked to be re-evaluated , with the use of the objective structured clinical examination.
C	No statistical significant difference between the two groups was noted in the written test , in contrast with data collected from the practice skills checklist.
C	Nurses in group A could easily identify the patient in cardiac arrest but had difficulties concerning chest compressions and handling the AED.
C	Nurses in group B were more focused during the performances , used AED more accurately and continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation with no delays.
C	Nurses prove to be more efficient in training nurses.

B	Studies of antisocial populations have found that they show deficits in recognition of facial affect.
B	Such deficits are also found in other populations with clinical conditions such as autism spectrum disorders , schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder.
P	We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that facial affect recognition in the Scottish prison population would differ from matched controls.
P	In addition , we aimed to investigate any relationship between facial affect recognition deficits and offence history.
M	A sample of serving convicted prisoners , drawn from a larger study , was assessed for ability to recognise facial affect.
M	Other variables were also measured and a self-report offending history obtained.
R	127 prisoners were assessed in 11 prisons.
R	Male prisoners were significantly worse than age , sex and IQ-matched controls at recognising negative facial emotions , specifically anger , fear , sadness and disgust.
R	Within the sample of prisoners , deficits in fear recognition were associated with a history of previous prison sentences but not previous convictions.
R	With respect to offending history , sex offenders were relatively better at recognising sadness and worse at recognising surprise than the other offenders.
R	These relationships remain after controlling for IQ.
C	Scottish convicted prisoners show deficits in recognising negative facial emotions in a pattern consistent with other antisocial populations.
C	We also demonstrated a relationship between particular patterns of deficit and types of offending history not previously described.

B	Smoking prevalence in adolescents and young adults is substantially elevated in Tunisia.
B	Moreover , there is a lack of knowledge regarding the effectiveness and associated factors in smoking cessation interventions among adolescents and young adults.
B	This study aims at identifying the major factors leading to smoking relapse among adolescents and young adults in the region of Monastir , Tunisia.
M	We carried out a prospective cohort study at the smoking cessation center of the University hospital of Monastir , Tunisia.
M	The population study consisted of all adolescents and young adults ( 15-30 years ) consulted during a period of two years ( 2009-2010 ).
M	A questionnaire was used to explore the patient's sociodemographic characteristics , smoking history , nicotine dependence ( Fagerstrom test ) and anxiety / depression ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ).
M	A telephone survey was conducted in July 2011 to assess smoking cessation results.
M	A multivariate Cox regression was used to identify predictors of smoking relapses.
R	A total of 221 adolescents and young adults were included in this study with a mean age of 25.5 +/- 3.9 years.
R	At follow up , 59 study participants ( 26.7% ) were abstinent and the overall median abstinence was 2 months.
R	In the multivariate analysis smoking relapse was associated with being an adolescent patient ( HR 2.16 ; 95% CI: 1.54-3.05 ) , medium or higher nicotine dependence at baseline ( HR 2.66 , 95% CI: 1.06-7.05 and HR 3.12 , 95% CI: 1.20-8.12 respectively ) , not receiving treatment ( HR 1.70 , 95% CI: 1.25-2.33 ) and have friend who is a smoker ( HR 1.63 ; 95% CI: 0.96-2.79 ).
C	The results of this study provide important information about beneficial effect of smoking cessation support for adolescent and young adults.
C	More efforts must be deployed to deal with contributing factors to smoking relapse.
B	With quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) we recently found no differences in sensory function of the foot soles between groups of torture victims with or without exposure to falanga ( beatings under the feet ).
B	Compared to matched controls the torture victims had hyperalgesia to deep mechano-nociceptive stimuli and hypoesthesia to non-noxious cutaneous stimuli.
B	The purpose of the present paper was to extend the group analysis into individual sensory profiles of victims' feet to explore possible relations between external violence ( torture ) , reported pain , sensory symptoms and QST data to help clarify the underlying mechanisms.
M	We employed interviews and assessments of the pain and sensory symptoms and QST by investigators blinded to whether the patients , 32 male torture victims from the Middle East , had ( n=15 ) , or had not ( n=17 ) been exposed to falanga.
M	Pain intensity , area and stimulus dependence were used to characterize the pain.
M	QST included thresholds for touch , cold , warmth , cold-pain , heat-pain , deep pressure pain and wind-up to cutaneous noxious stimuli.
M	An ethnically matched control group was available.
M	The normality criterion , from our control group data , was set as the mean +/- 1.28SD , thus including 80% of all values.
M	QST data were transformed into three categories in relation to our normality range ; hypoesthesia , normoesthesia or hyperesthesia/hyperalgesia.
R	Most patients , irrespective of having been exposed to falanga or not , reported severe pain when walking.
R	This was often associated with hyperalgesia to deep mechanical pressure.
R	Hypoesthesia to mechanical stimuli co-occurred with numbness , burning and with deep mechanical hyperalgesia more often than not , but otherwise , a hypoesthesia to cutaneous sensory modalities did not co-occur systematically to falanga , pain or sensory symptoms.
C	In torture victims , there seem to be overriding mechanisms , manifested by hyperalgesia to pressure pain , which is usually considered a sign of centralization.
C	In addition there was cutaneous hypoesthesia , but since there was no obvious correlation to the localization of trauma , these findings may indicate centrally evoked disturbances in sensory transmission , that is , central inhibition.
C	We interpret these findings as a sign of changes in central sensory processing as the unifying pathological mechanism of chronic pain in these persons.
B	Many studies have been conducted to assess the indoor air quality ( IAQ ) of buildings throughout the world because it is closely related to comfort , safety and work productivity of occupants.
B	However , there is still lack of available literature about IAQ in tropical buildings that apply radiant cooling systems in conditioning the indoor air.
M	This paper reports the results obtained from an IAQ audit that was conducted in a new radiantly cooled building in Malaysia , by focusing on the IAQ and thermal comfort parameters.
R	It was identified that the measured concentration levels for the five indoor air contaminants ( CO , CO2 , TVOC , formaldehyde and respirable particulates ) were within the threshold limit values ( TLVs ) specified in the IAQ guidelines.
R	Besides , no significant difference was found between the contaminant levels in each floor of the studied building , and a majority of the respondents did not encounter any form of physical discomfort.
R	There is a risk of condensation problem , judging from the measured RH level.
C	An increase of airflow rate and more dehumidification work in the studied building can be made to improve IAQ and prevention of condensation problem.
C	Nevertheless , these schemes should be implemented carefully to avoid occupants' discomfort.
C	Relocation of workstations was suggested , especially for the lower floors , which had higher occupancy levels.
B	Genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to the development of autism , but relatively few studies have considered potential environmental risks.
B	Here , we examine risks for autism in children related to in utero exposure to monitored ambient air toxics from urban emissions.
M	Among the cohort of children born in Los Angeles County , California , 1995-2006 , those whose mothers resided during pregnancy in a 5-km buffer around air toxics monitoring stations were included ( n = 148 ,722 ).
M	To identify autism cases in this cohort , birth records were linked to records of children diagnosed with primary autistic disorder at the California Department of Developmental Services between 1998 and 2009 ( n = 768 ).
M	We calculated monthly average exposures during pregnancy for 24 air toxics selected based on suspected or known neurotoxicity or neurodevelopmental toxicity.
M	Factor analysis helped us identify the correlational structure among air toxics , and we estimated odds ratios ( ORs ) for autism from logistic regression analyses.
R	Autism risks were increased per interquartile range increase in average concentrations during pregnancy of several correlated toxics mostly loading on 1 factor , including 1 ,3-butadiene ( OR = 1.59 [95% confidence interval = 1.18-2.15] ) , meta/para-xylene ( 1.51 [1.26-1.82] ) , other aromatic solvents , lead ( 1.49 [1.23-1.81] ) , perchloroethylene ( 1.40 [1.09-1.80] ) , and formaldehyde ( 1.34 [1.17-1.52] ) , adjusting for maternal age , race/ethnicity , nativity , education , insurance type , parity , child sex , and birth year.
C	Risks for autism in children may increase following in utero exposure to ambient air toxics from urban traffic and industry emissions , as measured by community-based air-monitoring stations.
B	Residency prepares trainees to deliver clinical care.
B	It's unknown if there is adequate career preparation , particularly for academic medicine.
B	Prior literature has shown that interest in pursuing an academic career wanes during residency.
B	Few trainees believe residency provides them with the necessary skills to be successful in academic medicine.
B	Formalized areas of concentration may allow for deepened experience and mentorship in a specific field and may contribute to increased scholarly productivity which has been associated with selecting an academic career.
B	Some training programs have instituted specialized tracks to allow residents to explore and develop an academic or clinical niche.
B	The pervasiveness and characteristics of tracks currently available are unknown.
B	A crucial first step in understanding how to best prepare residents for future careers is to understand current practice.
B	The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence and characteristics of specialized tracks in emergency medicine ( EM ) training programs in the United States of America ( USA ).
M	Allopathic EM training programs in the USA were identified by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine residency catalogue.
M	Program websites were identified through this catalogue and an internet search.
M	Each page of a program's website was dissected to identify basic program information and descriptions of their curricula including presence and descriptions of specialized tracks.
M	Descriptive statistics are reported.
R	163 programs were identified , 156( 95.7% ) programs provided detailed descriptions of their curricula on their program website.
R	33/156( 21.2% ) offered dedicated tracks.
R	Tracks were more common in four year programs ( 15/40 ;37.5% ) compared to three years ( 18/116 ;15.5% ).
R	23/33( 70% ) programs with tracks provided titles of their tracks and these commonly ( 20/23 ;87% ) mirrored typical fellowships in EM.
R	For programs that described the timing of tracks ( 15/33 ;45.5% ) , most spanned multiple years of training ( 12/15 ;80% ).
C	The presence of specialized tracks is not widespread in EM training programs in the USA , but is more commonly seen in four year programs.
C	The timing of tracks varied but typically spanned multiple years of training.
C	This information is a critical first step to allow future research to understand the impact of specialized tracks and their role in EM career choice and preparation for an academic career.
P	The purpose of this study was to develop a wellness index for workers ( WIW ) and examine the validity and reliability of the WIW for assessing workers' wellness.
M	The developmental process for the instrument included construction of a conceptual framework based on a wellness model , generation of initial items , verification of content validity , preliminary study , extraction of final items , and psychometric testing.
M	Content validity was verified by 4 experts from occupational health nursing and wellness disciplines.
M	The construct validity , convergent validity and discriminant validity were examined with confirmatory factor analysis.
M	The reliability was examined with Cronbach's alpha.
M	The participants were 494 workers from two workplaces.
R	Eighteen items were selected for the final scale , and the results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported a five -factor model of wellness with acceptable model fit , and factors named as physical " emotional"social.intellectual"occupational wellness.
R	The convergent and discriminant validity were also supported.
R	The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was.91.
C	The results indicate that the WIW is a valid and reliable instrument to comprehensively assess workers' wellness , and to provide basic directions for developing workplace wellness program.
P	The purpose of this research is to study the impact of individual factors such as emotional intelligence ( El ) and spiritual intelligence ( SI ) on the caring behavior of nurses.
M	A cross-sectional survey using questionnaire was conducted by sampling 550 nurses working in seven major public hospitals in Malaysia.
M	Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling ( SEM ).
R	The main findings are: ( 1 ) critical existential thinking and transcendental awareness dimensions of SI have significant impacts on assurance of human presence dimension of caring behavior ; ( 2 ) personal meaning production and conscious state expansion dimensions of SI have significant impacts on perception of emotion and managing own emotions dimensions of El ; and ( 3 ) managing own emotions dimension of El has significant impacts on respectful deference to other and assurance of human presence dimensions of caring behavior of nurses.
C	The results can be used to recruit and educate nurses.

B	It is well-known that dementia is undiagnosed , resulting in the exclusion of patients without a formal diagnosis of dementia in many studies.
B	Objectives of the present analyses were ( 1 ) to determine healthcare resource utilization and ( 2 ) costs of patients screened positive for dementia with a formal diagnosis and those without a formal diagnosis of dementia , and ( 3 ) to analyze the association between having received a formal dementia diagnosis and healthcare costs.
M	This analysis is based on 240 primary care patients who screened positive for dementia.
M	Within the baseline assessment , individual data about the utilization of healthcare services were assessed.
M	Costs were assessed from the perspective of insurance , solely including direct costs.
M	Associations between dementia diagnosis and costs were evaluated using multiple linear regression models.
R	Patients formally diagnosed with dementia were treated significantly more often by a neurologist , but less often by all other outpatient specialists , and received anti-dementia drugs and day care more often.
R	Diagnosed patients underwent shorter and less frequent planned in-hospital treatments.
R	Dementia diagnosis was significantly associated with higher costs of anti-dementia drug treatment , but significantly associated with less total medical care costs , which valuated to be Euro 5 ,123 compared , to Euro 5 ,565 for undiagnosed patients.
R	We found no association between dementia diagnosis and costs of evidence-based non-medication treatment or total healthcare cost ( Euro 7 ,346 for diagnosed vs. Euro 6 ,838 for undiagnosed patients ).
C	There are no significant differences in total healthcare cost between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients.
C	Dementia diagnosis is beneficial for receiving cost-intensive anti-dementia drug treatments , but is currently insufficient to ensure adequate non-medication treatment for community-dwelling patients.
B	Given the importance of physical activity ( PA ) and the low activity levels among adults with physical disabilities , it is important to understand how temporal changes in psychosocial constructs affect PA changes over time.
B	Objective/
P	Examine if changes in the transtheoretical model ( TTM ) constructs affected changes in PA levels over time.
M	One hundred thirty-two adults with physical disabilities , such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries , completed a web-based survey once every 4 months , for a total of 3 time points , to assess the TTM constructs and PA.
M	Six latent growth curve analyses were conducted using Mplus( 5 ) to examine if longitudinal changes in the TTM constructs affected temporal changes in PA levels.
R	All six hypothesized models fit the sample data well ( e.g. , chi( 2 ) = NS ; RMSEA = <.001-06 ).
R	In a descending order of significance , the best predictors of the initial levels of PA were the stages of change , the behavioral processes of change , the cognitive processes of change , self-efficacy , and perceived pros.
R	The meaningful predictors of PA changes over time were the initial levels and the slopes of the cognitive processes of change , perceived pros , and the behavioral processes of change.
R	Although the slopes of the stages of change and perceived cons did not have a statistically significant effect on PA changes , their effects approached a medium size ( .33 and .38 , respectively ).
C	In order to reassure the maintenance of an exercise program , interventionists need to first emphasize cognitive , motivational strategies ( cognitive processes of change ) , such as the importance of PA and positive thoughts about exercise participation as well as exercise benefits ( pros ) before they implement behavioral strategies ( behavioral processes of change ) , such as social support , goal setting , and self-rewarding.

B	The pharmaceutical industry has been shown to have a pervasive influence in the mental health field.
B	A recent study found that drug company funded websites were more likely to explain schizophrenia with a bias favourable to the sale of medication.
P	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the pharmaceutical industry is influencing the content of depression websites.
M	Google and Yahoo search engines were used to generate the top 50 depression websites.
M	Likert scales measured the extent to which biomedical approaches were presented by the websites.
R	Drug company funded sites were significantly more likely than non-drug-company funded sites to espouse aetiology in keeping with the biomedical paradigm.
R	Drug company funded sites also scored significantly higher on an overall Total score ( a measure including aetiology and treatment scores and defining depression as an illness or disease ).
C	These findings are discussed in the context of recent research confirming the limited efficacy of antidepressant drugs and the negative impact biomedical explanations have on public perceptions of depression.
B	Eastern African immigrants from countries affected by female genital mutilation have resettled in many developed countries , including Australia.
B	Although possibly at risk of perineal trauma and episiotomy , research investigating their perineal status post-migration is sparse.
P	To investigate variations in episiotomy use and incidence of severe perineal tear for women born in Eritrea , Ethiopia , Somalia and Sudan compared with Australian-born women.
M	A population-based study of 203 ,206 Australian-born and 3502 Eastern African immigrant women admitted as public patients , with singleton vaginal births between 1999 and 2007 , was conducted using the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection.
M	Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders selected a priori , were performed to compute incidence and adjusted odds ratios.
R	Overall , 30.5% Eastern African immigrants had episiotomy compared to 17.2% Australian-born women.
R	Severe perineal trauma occurred in 2.1% of Eastern African immigrants and 1.6% of Australianborn women.
R	While the odds of severe perineal trauma was significantly elevated only during noninstrumental vaginal births for Eastern African immigrants {OR( adj )1.56 95% CI( 1.17 , 2.12 )} ; that of episiotomy was increased during both non-instrumental {OR( adj )4.47 95% CI( 4.10 , 4.88 )} and instrumental {OR( adj )2.51 95% CI( 1.91 , 3.29 )} vaginal births.
C	Overall , Eastern African immigrant women experienced elevated odds of episiotomy and severe perineal tear.
C	Health care providers need to be mindful of the increased risk of severe perineal tear in these women and enhance efforts in identification and treatment of severe perineal trauma to minimise associated short and long term morbidity.
C	Strategies to reduce unneeded episiotomy and ways of enhancing perineal safety are also needed.

P	We sought to examine cancer diagnosis , cancer treatment , and related risk factors among Australian , middle-aged , exclusively heterosexual women compared with sexual minority women ( SMW ; mainly heterosexual , bisexual , mainly lesbian , and lesbian ).
M	Secondary data analysis of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health for women born in 1946 through 1951 ( n = 10 ,451 ) included bivariate tests ( i.e. , contingency table analyses , independent t tests ).
R	SMW did not have significantly higher cancer diagnoses compared with exclusively heterosexual women , although they were more likely to report never having had a mammogram or pap smear.
R	SMW were also significantly more likely to be high-risk drinkers ( 11.1% vs. 6.8% ; p <.05 ) , current smokers ( 15.1% vs. 8.3% ; p <.001 ) , report significantly higher rates of depression ( mean +/- SD ; 6.4 +/- 5.5 vs. 5.4 +/- 5.1 ; p <.01. )
R	, have experienced physical abuse ( 10.2% vs. 5.1% ; p <.001 ) , and been in a violent relationship ( 27.2% vs. 12.8% ; p <.001 ).
C	SMW had higher rates of several known cancer risk factors , ostensibly placing them at higher risk of cancer as well as chronic health conditions.
C	Further research is needed to determine whether increased risk results in increased cancer as these women age , and to inform the development of interventions to reduce the risk of disease for SMW.

B	Pregnancy and childrearing can impact women's health and alter chronic disease trajectories in later life , including cardiovascular disease.
B	The purpose of this study was to assess measures of women's cardiovascular health by time since last live birth.
M	Data were from 4 ,021 nonpregnant U.S. women , 20-44 years of age , participating in the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ).
M	Cardiovascular health was assessed using physical measures , laboratory measures , self-reported behaviors , medical conditions , and selected psychosocial factors by time since last live birth.
R	Women reported their last live birth within the past 12 months ( "mothers of infants" ; 7.4% ) , >12 months , but <3 years ago ( "mothers of toddlers" ; 10.0% ) , or >= 3 years ago ( "mothers of older children" ; 45.2% ) ; 37.3% were nulliparous.
R	Compared with nulliparous women , mothers of older children had a higher prevalence of selected cardiovascular risk factors , including unhealthy diet ( 75.6% vs. 68.8% ) and smoking ( 28.1% vs. 21.9% ) , after adjustment for sociodemographics ( including age ).
R	Mothers of toddlers had a higher prevalence of unhealthy diet ( 78.0% vs. 68.8% ).
R	Mothers also had poorer metabolic health as indicated by a higher prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among mothers of toddlers and older children ( 44.2% and 40.4% , respectively , vs. 33.6% ) , and a higher prevalence of high waist circumference among mothers of infants ( 65.6% vs. 53.8% ).
R	Some mothers also had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors , including low physical activity and poor sleep.
C	Prior pregnancy and childrearing may be associated with selected cardiovascular risk factors among nonpregnant reproductive-aged U.S. women.
B	Recent studies highlight a potential role of cholesterol metabolic disturbance in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease ( AD ).
B	The adenosine triphosphate ( ATP )-binding cassette transporter 1 ( ABCA1 ) gene resides within proximity of linkage peaks on chromosome 9q influence AD and plays a key role in cellular cholesterol efflux in the brain.
M	We studied the role of R219K and V825I polymorphisms of ABCA1 in modulating the risk of AD in 321 AD patients and 349 comparisons of Chinese Han.
M	Genotyping of R219K and V825I were performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
R	The genotype distribution of R219K was different with more RK in total AD group ( chi( 2 ) = 8.705 , df = 2 , p = 0.013 ) , late-onset AD ( LOAD ) group ( chi( 2 ) = 10.636 , df = 2 , p = 0.005 ) , APOE non-epsilon 4 epsilon 4 group ( chi( 2 ) = 9.900 , df = 2 , p = 0.007 ) , and female AD group ( chi( 2 ) = 8.369 , df = 2 , p = 0.015 ).
R	Logistic regression manifested the risk of AD increased in RK carriers in total AD group ( Wald = 6.102 , df = 1 , p = 0.014 , odds ratio [OR]: 1.546 , 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.094-2.185 ) , LOAD group ( Wald = 7.746 , df = 1 , p = 0.005 , OR: 1.921 , 95% CI: 1.213-3.041 ) , and APOE non-epsilon 4 epsilon 4 group ( Wald = 6.399 , df = 1 , p = 0.011 , OR: 1.586 , 95% CI: 1.109-2.266 ).
R	K allele ( RK + KK ) also increased the risk of AD compared with RR allele in LOAD group ( Wald = 4.750 , df = 1 , p = 0.029 , OR: 1.619 , 95% CI: 1.050-2.497 ).
R	However , no discrepancy was found in V825I.
R	In R219K , age at onset ( AAO ) was significantly lower by 4.9 years on average in patients of KK genotype than those of RK in APOE epsilon 4 carrying group and higher by 5.5 years in patients of KK genotype than those of RR in APOE epsilon 4 noncarrying group.
R	In V825I , AAO was diseased by 4.3 years in II genotype compared with VV genotype in APOE epsilon 4 noncarrying group and 3.4 years in APOE epsilon 4 epsilon 4 noncarrying group.
C	The results indicated that the RK genotype or K allele ( RK + KK ) of R219K may relate to the development of AD in the east of China.

B	Recognition of the significance of anxiety disorders in older adults is growing.
B	The revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) provides a timely opportunity to consider potential improvements to diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders for use with older people.
B	The authors of this paper comprise the Advisory Committee to the DSM5 Lifespan Disorders Work Group , the purpose of which was to generate informative responses from individuals with clinical and research expertise in the field of late-life anxiety disorders.
M	This paper reviews the unique features of anxiety in later life and synthesizes the work of the Advisory Committee.
R	Suggestions are offered for refining our understanding of the effects of aging on anxiety and other disorders ( e. g. , mood disorders ) and changes to the DSM5 criteria and text that could facilitate more accurate recognition and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in older adults.
R	Several of the recommendations are not limited to the study of anxiety but rather are applicable across the broader field of geriatric mental health.
C	DSM5 should provide guidelines for the thorough assessment of avoidance , excessiveness , and comorbid conditions ( e. g. , depression , medical illness , cognitive impairment ) in anxious older adults.

B	In 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) in New Jersey , one of the wealthiest states in the United States , than in other surveillance regions.
P	To examine the association of socioeconomic status ( SES ) with ASD prevalence.
M	Information on eight-year-olds with ASD from four counties was abstracted from school and medical records.
M	US Census 2000 provided population and median household income data.
R	586 children with ASD were identified: autism prevalence was 10.2/1000 , higher in boys than girls ( 16 vs. 4/1000 ) ; higher in white and Asian non-Hispanics than in black non-Hispanics and Hispanics ( 12.5 , 14.0 , 9.0 , and 8.5/1000 , respectively ) ; and higher ( 17.2/1000 ( 95% CI 14.0-21.1 ) ) in tracts with median income > US$90 ,000 than in tracts with median income acurrency signUS$30 ,000 ( 7.1 ( 95% CI 5.7-8.9 ) ).
R	Number of professional evaluations was higher , and age at diagnosis younger , in higher income tracts ( p < .001 ) , but both measures spanned a wide overlapping range in all SES levels.
R	In multivariable models race/ethnicity did not predict ASD , but the prevalence ratio was 2.2 ( 95% CI 1.5-3.1 ) when comparing highest with lowest income tracts.
C	In the US state of New Jersey , ASD prevalence is higher in wealthier census tracts , perhaps due to differential access to pediatric and developmental services.
B	Voice problems are more common in teachers due to intensive voice use during routine at work.
B	There is evidence that occupational disphonia prevention programs are important in improving the quality voice and consequently the quality of subjects' lives.
P	To investigate the impact of educational voice interventions for teachers on quality of life and voice.
M	A longitudinal interventional study involving 70 teachers randomly selected from 11 public schools , 30 to receive educational intervention with vocal training exercises and vocal hygiene habits ( experimental group ) and 40 to receive guidance on vocal hygiene habits ( control group control ).
M	Before the process of educational activities , the Voice-Related Quality of Life instrument ( V-RQOL ) was applied , and 3 months after conclusion of the activities , the subjects were interviewed again , using the same instrument.
M	For data analysis , Prox MIXED were applied , with a level of significance alpha < 0.05.
R	Teachers showed significantly higher domain and overall V-RQOL scores after preventive intervention , in both control and experimental groups.
R	Nevertheless , there was no statistical difference in scores between the groups.
C	Educational actions for vocal health had a positive impact on the quality of life of the participants , and the incorporation of permanent educational actions at institutional level is suggested.
B	Paediatric palliative care is a nuanced area of practice with additional complexities in the context of intellectual disability.
B	There is currently minimal research to guide clinicians working in this challenging area of care.
M	This study describes the complex care of children with life-limiting conditions and intellectual disability by means of a literature synthesis and commentary with "best-practice" guide.
R	As few articles concerning children with intellectual disability and palliative care needs were identified by formal systematic review , our expert consensus group has drawn from the paediatric palliative , oncology and adult intellectual disability literature to highlight common clinical challenges encountered in the day-to-day care of children with intellectual disability and life-limiting conditions.
C	A longitudinal child- and family-centred approach is key to ensuring best-practice care for families of children with life-limiting conditions and intellectual disability.
C	As highlighted by the great absence of literature addressing this important patient population , further research in this area is urgently required.
B	There has been a relative lack of research examing the distribution of care to elderly dependent people in Spain.
B	The aim of this paper is to analyse how formal and informal care is provided to elderly dependent people in Spain and to assess the socio-economic conditions in which the different kinds of care emerge.
M	This study is based tin a sample of the elderly dependent population selected front those who reported the need of care in the 2003 Spanish Health Survey The distribution of care among older people wits cross-tabulated to identify the type of care.
M	while regression models were used to identify the socio-economic characteristics of people receiving formal and/or informal care.
R	Around 7.5% of the elderly people who need care do not receive it.
R	Among those who do receive it , 89.4% receive informal care , 14.8% private care and 8.1% public care.
R	11.9% of elderly people in the study receive a mix of formal an informal care.
R	Elderly people living in households in which the monthly income exceeds EUR900 are five times more likely than people living in households in which the monthly income is less than EUR 600 to receive private care instead of public care.
R	People older than 84 years are six times more likely to receive public care than people aged between 65 and 74.
C	Men are two times more likely than women to receive exclusively informal care.
C	Women are three times more likely than men to receive both kinds of care simultaneously.
C	Formal care complements informal care.
C	Private care is more common than public care.
C	Men , people living in larger-sized households , and people with fewer socioeconomic resources are more likely to receive informal care.
B	Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass and function with age and is associated with decline in mobility , frailty , falls and mortality.
B	There is considerable interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms.
B	Our aim was to characterise muscle morphology changes associated with sarcopenia among community dwelling older men.
M	One hundred and five men aged 68-76 years were recruited to the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study ( HSS ) for detailed characterisation of muscle including measures of muscle mass , strength and function.
M	Muscle tissue was obtained from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis for 99 men and was processed for immunohistochemical studies to determine myofibre distribution and area , capillarisation and satellite cell ( SC ) density.
R	Six ( 6 % ) men had sarcopenia as defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People ( EWGSOP ) criteria.
R	These men had lower SC density ( 1.7 cells/mm( 2 ) vs 3.8 cells/mm( 2 ) , p = 0.06 ) and lower SC/fibre ratio ( 0.02 vs 0.06 , p = 0.06 ) than men without sarcopenia.
R	Although men with sarcopenia tended to have smaller myofibres and lower capillary to fibre ratio , these relationships were not statistically significant.
C	We have shown that there may be altered muscle morphology parameters in older men with sarcopenia.
C	These results have the potential to help identify cell and molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.
C	This work now requires extension to larger studies which also include women.
B	The current study aimed to examine the effects of diagnostic and symptomatic information on auditory linguistic event-related potentials ( ERPs ) in the listener , in response to speech containing schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities.
M	73 participants listened to conversation segments while continuous EEG was recorded.
M	Participants were told that the responder in the conversation was either a university student , had symptoms from a stroke , had symptoms from schizophrenia , or had recovered from schizophrenia.
M	The final word of the response was randomly presented as a typical ending , word approximation , neologism , or filler ending.
R	A significant N400 was observed over centro-parietal electrode sites in response to word approximations and neologisms in the university student condition only.
R	There were no differences between conditions in the N100 ERP , and EEG measures were not related to either subjective or objective measures of stigmatizing attitudes.
C	The N400 effect may represent disengagement , at a semantic level , from what an individual is saying based on symptomatic or diagnostic information about schizophrenia.

B	Efficient actions to fight elder abuse are highly dependent on reliable dimensions of the phenomenon.
B	Accurate measures are nevertheless difficult to achieve owing to the sensitivity of the topic.
B	Different research endeavours indicate varying prevalence rates , which are explained by different research designs and definitions used , but little is known about measurement errors such as item non-responses and how outcomes are affected by modes of administration.
M	A multi-national study was developed to measure domestic abuse against home-dwelling older women ( aged > 60 years ) in Europe.
M	The measurement instrument covered six forms of abuse , adapted from the Conflict Tactics Scale.
M	2880 individuals were interviewed by three different data collection methods ( i.e. postal , face-to-face , telephone ).
R	Principal component analysis of missing values of 34 indicators of abuse showed various patterns of item non-response.
R	Moreover , principal component analysis indicated several response patterns across different types of data collection.
R	A binary logistic regression explained that item non-response and abuse prevalence is influenced by individual characteristics ( social status , vulnerability ) , method effects such as content ( sensitivity ) , the order of the questions ( forms of abuse ) , by type of data collection and the presence of assistance in survey completion.
C	The discussion revolves around how these findings could help improving measuring elder abuse.
C	Advantages and disadvantages of the questionnaire and type of data collection methods are discussed in relation to three potential types of response errors: item positioning effect , acquiescence and social desirability.
B	The relationships between traumatic stress and self-conscious emotions , such as shame and guilt , remain to be fully explored , especially in refugees , who frequently are exposed to a multitude of stressors.
P	The aim of the present study was to investigate shame and guilt in refugee minors and to assess to what extent a greater cumulative exposure to traumatic stressors would result not only in more severe posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms but also in higher levels of shame and guilt.
M	Thirty-two male refugee minors , who were all below the age of 18 when they sought asylum in Germany , agreed to participate.
M	At the time of the assessment , the age ranged from 11 to 20 years.
M	Eighteen refugees had arrived without relatives in their host country ( "unaccompanied minors'' ).
M	In structured diagnostic interviews , a PTSD diagnosis was established using the UCLA PTSD Index.
M	Posttraumatic guilt was assessed by means of the Trauma-related Guilt Inventory , and the Shame Variability Questionnaire was used to record the intensity , duration , and frequency of shame episodes.
R	Feelings of guilt and shame as well as trauma symptoms were all associated with the number of traumatic event types subjects had experienced.
R	Posttraumatic guilt and shame were both correlated with PTSD symptom severity.
C	The findings indicate that cumulative stress such as exposure to multiple traumatic events poses a risk factor for the mental health including greater suffering and functional impairment due to shame and guilt.
P	The purpose of the study was to explore parents' attitudes and beliefs about the nine-valent human papillomavirus vaccine ( HPV9 ).
M	Online focus groups were conducted in January , 2015.
M	The U.S. national sample of parents was recruited to four groups: ( 1 ) two groups of parents of HPV unvaccinated daughters aged 9-12 years and ( 2 ) two groups of parents of vaccinated daughters aged 11-17 years.
R	Participants were 43 parents of vaccinated daughters and 38 parents of unvaccinated daughters.
R	Results indicated low and variable levels of knowledge about HPV , related cancers , and vaccination ( e.g. , parents unaware vaccine is recommended for boys ).
R	Parents were encouraged that HPV9 covered more types , and many said they want the "better" vaccine.
R	Parents of unvaccinated girls wondered whether they should delay vaccination until HPV9 was available , whereas parents of vaccinated girls wondered whether their daughters could be revaccinated with HPV9.
R	Concerns were related to adverse reactions and side effects , whether another new vaccine will be released after HPV9 , HPV mutation ( i.e. , will HPV types change over time-thereby necessitating multiple vaccines? )
R	, and cost.
R	Physician recommendation was identified as the most important facilitator of vaccination , with participants wanting providers to exhibit high levels of confidence in and knowledge about HPV vaccines.
R	Last , parents also viewed the prospective idea of a 2-dose HPV9 vaccine as positive.
C	HPV9 recently became available in the United States and has the potential to offer greater cancer prevention if widespread acceptance and uptake occur.
C	Understanding parental perceptions and questions about HPV9 will be important for clinical messaging about this vaccine.

B	Scant research has examined the effect of neuropsychological ( NP ) functioning on treatment outcome in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ).
B	This study sought to address this gap in existing research.
M	A total of 63 youths were included in this study and asked to complete the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure ( ROCF ) and specific subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children , Third Edition ( WISC-III ).
R	Analyses suggest that 5 min recall accuracy ( raw score ) and percent recall from the ROCF , assessed before treatment may be predictors of treatment response among children with OCD.
R	What is more , exploratory post hoc analyses indicated that performance on these ROCF tasks is particularly relevant among youths receiving cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT ) alone.
R	These results may be driven by executive functioning ability.
R	Additional analyses suggest a relationship between age , symptom severity , and NP functioning on select tasks from both the ROCF and WISC-III.
C	Although alternative explanations exist , these findings suggest that poorer performance on the ROCF and , in turn , poorer response to treatment , particularly among those youths receiving CBT alone , may be due to executive functioning difficulties.
C	Clinicians and researchers should be sensitive to this fact and may warrant modification( s ) to existing treatment protocols.
C	Limitations to this study , however ; suggest the need for replication and extension of these findings in the future.

P	This paper assesses the text structure imposed on patient information leaflets in the European Union ( EU ).
P	It proposes an alternative structure based on reader-oriented research.
M	Two card-sorting studies were used to identify reader expectations.
M	In a closed card-sorting study , participants were provided with scenario questions on medication use and were asked under which of the template headings they expected to find information on each question.
M	In an open sorting task , the schemata of patient information leaflet readers were explored.
M	In this study , participants sorted a large set of sentences that can be found in actual patient information leaflets.
R	The closed card-sorting study reveals that users provided with the EU template structure do not always look at the correct section when searching information about patient situations.
R	The results of the open card-sorting study indicate that readers prefer the following structure: goal of the medicine - directions for use - potential problems - packaging and storage.
C	Card-sorting data help to evaluate and design text structures for genres such as patient information leaflets.
C	The European template does not match users' expectations concerning the leaflet's structure.
C	There is a mismatch between the wording of headings and reader interpretations.
C	A second mismatch has to do with classifying and grouping information.
C	Patient information presented in the alternative format may be expected to improve reading performance.
P	The purpose of this study was to reach an international consensus to determine what key elements should be part of a transition program and what indicators could be used to assess its success.
M	For this purpose , a Delphi study including an international panel of 37 experts was carried out.
M	The study consisted of three rounds , with response rates ranging from 86.5% to 95%.
M	At each round , experts were asked to assess key elements ( defined as the most important elements for the task ) and indicators ( defined as quantifiable characteristics ).
M	At each round , panelists were contacted via e-mail explaining them the tasks to be done and giving them the Web link where to complete the questionnaire.
M	At Round 3 , each key element and indicator was assessed as essential , very important , important , accessory , or unnecessary.
M	A 70% agreement was used as cutoff.
R	At Round 3 , more than 70% of panelists agreed on six key elements being essential , with one of them ( Assuring a good coordination between pediatric and adult professionals ) reaching an almost complete consensus ( 97% ).
R	Additionally , 11 more obtained more than 70% agreement when combined with the Very important category.
R	Among indicators , only one ( Patient not lost to follow-up ) was considered almost unanimously ( 91% ) as essential by the panelists and seven others also reached consensus when the Very important category was included.
C	Using these results as a framework to develop guidelines at local , national , and international levels would allow better assessing and comparing transition programs.

B	While there is growing interest in the possibility that cannabis may be a partial substitute for opioids , studies have yet to examine whether individuals with co-occurring opioid and cannabis use disorders ( OUD and CUD ) have less risk of negative outcomes than those with OUD only.
P	This study sought to compare the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with co-occurring OUD and CUD to patients with OUD only , CUD only , and patients with any other drug use disorders.
P	We hypothesized that co-occurring OUD and CUD would be associated with lower risk of inpatient admissions and emergency department ( ED ) visits , lower rates of homelessness , and fewer opioid prescriptions.
M	Comparisons were based on bivariate analyses , logistic and linear multiple regression models of National Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) data from Fiscal Year 2012.
R	Of the 234 ,181 ( 94% male ) patients diagnosed with drug use disorders , 8.6% were diagnosed with co-occurring OUD and CUD ; 33.3% with OUD only ; 26.5% with CUD only ; and 31.6% with other drug use disorders.
R	Compared to the OUD only group ( Mean = 4.8 ( SD = 8.84 ) ) , the group with co-occurring OUD and CUD was associated with a lower number of opioid prescriptions ( Mean = 3.79 ( SD = 8.22 ) ) ( d = -0.16 ) , but higher likelihood of inpatient psychiatric admission ( RR = 1.95 ) and homelessness ( RR = 1.52 ) , and no significant difference in ED visits.
C	These data highlight the need to further investigate whether the complex effects of cannabis use on patients with OUD are counterbalanced by potential benefits of reduced in opioid prescribing.
P	The perceived hazard and rated importance of standard safety , fluorescent , and neon colors are investigated.
B	Colors are used in warnings to enhance hazard communication.
B	Red has consistently been rated as the highest in perceived hazard.
B	Orange , yellow , and black are the next highest in connoted hazard ; however , there is discrepancy in their ordering.
B	Safety standards , such as ANSI Z535.1 , also list colors to convey important information , but little research has examined the perceived importance of colors.
B	In addition to standard safety colors , fluorescent colors are more commonly used in warnings.
B	Understanding hazard and importance perceptions of standard safety and fluorescent colors is necessary to create effective warnings.
M	Ninety participants rated and ranked a total of 33 colors on both perceived hazard and perceived importance.
R	Rated highest were the safety red colors from the American National Standard Institute ( ANSI ) , International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , and Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) together with three fluorescent colors ( orange , yellow , and yellow-green ) from 3 M on both dimensions.
R	Rankings were similar to ratings except that fluorescent orange was the highest on perceived hazard , while fluorescent orange and safety red from the ANSI were ranked as the highest in perceived importance.
C	Fluorescent colors convey hazard and importance levels as high as the standard safety red colors.
C	Implications for conveying hazard and importance in warnings through color are discussed.

B	Schizophrenia and related psychoses are associated with excess morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease ( CVD ).
B	Single-site studies on CVD-related risk factors in representative samples of acutely admitted inpatients are scarce.
P	To assess the levels of risk factors related to CVD in patients acutely admitted to hospital for symptoms of psychosis.
M	Eligible patients aged 18--65 years were included consecutively in the Bergen Psychosis Project ( BPP ).
M	CVD-related risk factors were recorded at admittance and at discharge or after 6 weeks at the latest.
M	The recordings of 218 patients with psychosis ( BPP ) were compared with the findings of 50 ,219 subjects from the population-based Nord-Tr circle divide ondelag Health Study 1995--97 ( HUNT2 ) survey.
R	Diastolic blood pressures were higher for BPP women and men , whereas body mass indexes ( BMIs ) and total cholesterol levels were higher in HUNT2 women and men.
R	On categorical measures , smoking was more prevalent in the patients compared with the HUNT2 subjects.
R	Metabolic syndrome was present in 11.8% and 21.9% of BPP women and men , respectively.
R	At discharge or 6 weeks from admission , 3.2% and 18.6% of BPP women and men , respectively , had metabolic syndrome.
R	BMIs and total cholesterol levels had worsened during the inpatient treatment period.
R	Only one patient had a diagnosis corresponding to the CVD risk found , and only four patients received antidiabetics , antihypertensives or lipid-lowering drugs.
C	Some CVD-related risk factors were high in the patients at admission , some worsened and CVD risk factors seem to be suboptimally addressed , which should warrant increased awareness on the topic in clinical practice.

B	Although the incidence of cannabis abuse/dependence in Americans is rising , the neurobiology of cannabis addiction is not well understood.
B	Imaging studies have demonstrated deficits in striatal D-2/D-3 receptor availability in several substance-dependent populations.
B	However , this has not been studied in currently using chronic cannabis users.
P	The purpose of this study was to compare striatal D-2/D-3 receptor availability between currently using chronic cannabis users and healthy controls.
M	Eighteen right-handed males age 18-34 were studied.
M	Ten subjects were chronic cannabis users ; eight were demographically matched controls.
M	Subjects underwent a [C-11]raclopride ( RAC ) PET scan.
M	Striatal RAC binding potential ( BPND ) was calculated on a voxel-wise basis.
M	Prior to scanning , urine samples were obtained from cannabis users for quantification of urine Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) and THC metabolites ( 11-nor-Delta-9-THC-9-carboxylic acid ; THC-COOH and 11-hydroxy-THC ;OH-THC ).
R	There were no differences in D-2/D-3 receptor availability between cannabis users and controls.
R	Voxel-wise analyses revealed that RAC BPND values were negatively associated with both urine levels of cannabis metabolites and self-report of recent cannabis consumption.
C	In this sample , current cannabis use was not associated with deficits in striatal D-2/D-3 receptor availability.
C	There was an inverse relationship between chronic cannabis use and striatal RAC BPND.
C	Additional studies are needed to identify the neurochemical consequences of chronic cannabis use on the dopamine system.

B	Nurses in the general ward are faced with patients who are at high risk of clinical deterioration.
B	Having the key role in performing routine vital signs monitoring , non-registered nurses such as enrolled nurses are the front line nurses who play a pivotal role in detecting and responding to the deteriorating ward patient.
P	( 1 ) To explore the experience of enrolled nurses with deteriorating patients in pre-cardiac arrest situations and ( 2 ) to identify strategies to enhance their role in caring for deteriorating ward patients.
M	A qualitative study using critical incident technique was conducted.
M	Fifteen enrolled nurses who had encountered deteriorating ward patients were interviewed.
M	Data were analysed using content analysis.
R	Three themes emerged describing enrolled nurse's experience with deteriorating patients: recognizing deterioration , responding to deterioration and taking responsibility.
R	Two themes , including educational development and modifying clinical processes , were strategies identified to enhance the ability of enrolled nurses in recognizing and managing deteriorating patients.
C	The study highlighted a need to enhance the ability of front line nurses in recognizing and responding to patient deterioration through nursing education and modifications of clinical processes.
C	Implications for Nursing and Health Policy: Nursing education could focus on increasing the awareness of the importance of performing complete vital signs monitoring and undertaking accurate interpretation of vital signs.
C	Strategies to improve clinical processes could include the need for registered nurses to provide supervision of enrolled nurses in the interpretation of vital signs readings and share the responsibility of performing vital signs monitoring.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the executive function ( EF ) abilities of preschool children who do ( CWS ) and do not stutter ( CWNS ) using a parent-report questionnaire and a behavioral task.
M	Participants were 75 CWS and 75 CWNS between the ages of 3 ;0 and 5 ;11 ( years ; months ).
M	Parents rated their children's EF abilities using the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function Preschool Version ( BRIEF-P ; Gioia , Espy , & Isquith , 2003 ).
M	Children's ability to integrate cognitive flexibility , inhibitory control , and working memory was measured using a behavioral task , the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders ( HTKS ; Cameron Ponitz , McClelland , Matthews , & Morrison , 2009 ).
R	The CWS were judged by their parents as being less proficient in working memory , shift/flexibility , and overall EF than the parents of the CWNS.
R	Children in the CWS group were also 21/2 to 7 times more likely than children in the CWNS group to exhibit clinically significant difficulties with EF.
R	Behavioral task findings revealed that 3-year old CWS performed more poorly than their peers on the HTKS.
R	Parental ratings of executive function and working memory were significantly and moderately correlated with receptive and expressive vocabulary skills only for the CWNS group.
C	CWS have more difficulty with EF in everyday life and may experience early delays in their ability to integrate aspects of attention and EF compared to CWNS.
P	To examine correlates of early initiation into sex work in two Mexico-U.S. border cities.
M	Female sex workers ( FSWs ) >= 18 years without known HIV infection living in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez who had recent unprotected sex with clients underwent baseline interviews.
M	Correlates of initiation into sex work before age 18 were identified with logistic regression.
R	Of 920 FSWs interviewed in Tijuana ( N = 474 ) and Ciudad Juarez ( N = 446 ) , 9.8% ( N = 90 ) were early initiators ( <18 years ) into sex work.
R	Median age of entry into sex work was 26 years ( range: 6-58 ).
R	After adjusting for age , compared to older initiators , early initiators were more likely to use inhalants ( 21.1% vs. 9.6% , p = .002 ) , initiate sex work to pay for alcohol ( 36.7% vs. 18.4% , p < .001 ) , report abuse as a child ( 42.2% vs. 18.7% , p < .0001 ) , and they were less likely to be migrants ( 47.8% vs. 62.3% , p = .02 ).
R	Factors independently associated with early initiation included inhalant use ( adjOR = 2.39 ) , initiating sex work to pay for alcohol ( adjOR = 1.88 ) and history of child abuse ( adjOR = 2.92 ).
R	Factors associated with later initiation included less education ( adjOR = 0.43 per 5-year increase ) , migration ( adjOR = 0.47 ) , and initiating sex work for better pay ( adjOR = 0.44 ) or to support children ( adjOR = 0.03 ).
C	Different pathways for entering sex work are apparent among younger versus older females in the Mexico-U.S. border region.
C	Among girls , interventions are needed to prevent inhalant use and child abuse and to offer coping skills ; among older initiators , income-generating strategies , childcare , and services for migrants may help to delay or prevent entry into sex work.

B	To examine the associations and differences between gender and weight classification for physical activity ( PA ) and individual , social , and parental factors.
M	Data from wave 2 of the "Growing up in Ireland" national study were used , resulting in a sample of 7525 13-year-old adolescents.
M	Information on factors affecting adolescents' social , emotional , cognitive , and physical development was collected.
R	Overweight ( OW ) adolescents were more likely to exercise and restrict food for weight loss and less likely to perform moderate to vigorous PA than normal weight adolescents.
R	Parent body mass index was associated with adolescent body mass index for OW and normal weight adolescents , with the strongest association seen with OW females.
R	Parents of OW adolescents considered themselves to be more OW and less physically active than parents of normal weight adolescents.
R	Furthermore , for all groups , a greater amount of moderate to vigorous PA was associated with less television viewing , greater PA of parents , and a greater number of friends.
C	Parental health behaviors play a significant role in adolescents' bodyweight , representing the necessity for more constructive health behaviors and PA among parents.
C	Future interventions may be strengthened by focusing specifically on gender and body mass index , while taking into consideration the importance of parental behaviors on adolescents.
B	Symptom monitoring and alleviation are basic to the care of children and adolescents with cancer.
B	A symptom checklist helps facilitate this process.
P	The primary objective of this study was to calibrate a child-friendly , clinically usable checklist capturing symptom occurrence and severity ; a secondary objective was to examine age group differences: 5 to 11 years ( n = 222 ) and 12 to 17 years ( n = 163 ) and sex differences: males ( 54% ) and females ( 46% ) , and correlate symptom severity , functional status , and quality of life.
M	Three hundred eighty-five children/adolescents at 5 university-affiliated outpatient oncology clinics: central , western , eastern , southeastern United States.
M	Diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 45% ) , solid tumors ( 14% ) , nervous system tumors ( 18% ) , and others ( 23% ).
M	Principal component factor analysis , confirmatory factor analysis , correlational statistics , t test , Wilcoxon test were performed.
R	( a ) Robust 30-item checklist , 7 factors ; ( b ) 14 of 30 symptoms reported by at least 40% of patients.
R	Top 5 are feeling sluggish ( 77% ) , nausea ( 72% ) , appetite loss ( 66% ) , irritable ( 61% ) , and vomiting ( 54% ).
R	( c ) Sixteen of 30 symptoms reported at severity 2 or greater: "quite a bit."
R	( d ) Therapy-Related Symptom Checklist-Children ( TRSC-C ) scores are as follows: range , 0 to 89 ; mean , 25.14 ( SD , 18.68 ).
R	( e ) Cronbach alpha = .9106.
R	( f ) Older children reported greater symptom severities: TRSC-C ( t = 2.73 , P = .003 ).
R	( g ) There were no sex differences on the TRSC-C total score.
R	( h ) Lansky correlations with TRSC-C ( r = -0.32 ; P = .02 ) ; factors: nutrition related ( r = -0.36 ; P = .05 ) ; oropharyngeal ( r = -0.51 ; P = .0002 ) ; and respiratory ( r = - 0.25 ; P = .06 ).
R	( i ) Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory correlation with TRSC-C ( r = -0.68 ; P = .0001 ).
C	The new TRSC-C has good measurement properties and is ready for use in clinics and research.
C	Use of the TRSC-C is consistent with guidelines emphasizing self-report of patient symptoms , shared patient decision making , and improved communications among patients , clinicians , and significant others.
B	Endothelial dysfunction measured via flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) is associated with greater risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women.
B	Aerobic exercise training has been shown to improve endothelial function in Caucasian populations , but has not been evaluated specifically in African Americans.
B	This has clinical importance due to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in African Americans.
M	In the present pilot study , 8 African American ( age: 55.81.7 years , peak oxygen uptake [VO2 peak]: 21.03.9mL/kg/minute , body mass index [BMI]: 30.1 +/- 6.3kg/m( 2 ) ) and 16 Caucasian ( age: 57.2 +/- 5.9 years , VO2 peak: 21.8 +/- 3.7mL/kg/minute , BMI: 29.3 +/- 5.2kg/m( 2 ) ) sedentary postmenopausal women underwent brachial artery FMD measurements before and after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training.
M	FMD was quantified by comparing B-mode ultrasound images of the brachial artery at rest and following reactive hyperemia after 5 minutes of forearm occlusion.
M	Participants performed aerobic exercise training 4 days per week for 12 weeks.
R	Despite improvements in fitness in both groups , aerobic exercise training did not significantly improve FMD in African American ( 5.8% to 5.7% , p=0.950 ) or Caucasian postmenopausal women ( 5.7% to 6.6% , p=0.267 ).
R	In women with the greatest impairment in endothelial function at baseline ( FMD<4.5% ) , a significant improvement in FMD was observed , independent of race , following exercise training ( 2.2% to 6.2% , p=0.007 ).
C	The benefits of aerobic exercise training on endothelial function in postmenopausal women are most pronounced in women with endothelial dysfunction prior to training and do not appear to be affected by race.
P	The purpose of this article is to discuss the challenges and rewards of developing and nurturing an international clinical psychiatric mental health advanced nursing practice exchange between the Netherlands and the United States.
P	Since 1997 , Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands has been participating in international clinical experiences for their psychiatric mental health ( PMH ) advanced practice nursing students.
P	The international experience is mandatory prior to graduation and is the first of its kind in Europe to mandate such a unique experience.
M	This study sample included eight Dutch PMH advanced practice nursing students enrolled in a full-time master's in advanced nursing practice program.
M	The descriptive study included reflective reports and one-on-one discussions over a 3-year period.
C	With proper planning , an international nursing experience provides a unique opportunity for nurses to think beyond their own culture and healthcare system.
C	Solving problems together through different perspectives creates opportunities for creative solutions.
C	International partnerships within PMH advanced practice nursing promotes sharing of knowledge and solutions as patients and diseases have no border.
B	Duration of drug therapy is a key measure of drug effectiveness in schizophrenia.
B	The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) trial found that only olanzapine achieved a longer time to all-cause-discontinuation ( TTAD ) than a standard therapy comparator.
B	This study compares the TTAD achieved when using alternative antipsychotics to treat patients with schizophrenia in real-world practice settings.
M	A total of 219 ,504 episodes of antipsychotic therapy initiated in the years 2000 to 2002 were identified using data from the California Medicaid ( Medi-Cal ) program.
M	To capture the full range of treatment scenarios facing clinicians , four episode types were included: restarting therapy using the drug used in the preceding episode ; restarting therapy using a different medication ( delayed switches ) ; switching therapy without a break in therapy ; and augmentation.
M	TTAD and changes in therapy were analyzed using ordinary least squares and logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards models.
R	Atypical antipsychotics consistently achieved longer TTAD and reduced switching rates relative to conventional antipsychotics.
R	Differences in TTAD favoring atypical antipsychotics were 13 to 15 days in restart episodes ; 28 to 36 days for delayed switching episodes ; 41 to 52 days in switching episodes ; and 59 to 63 days for augmentation ( P < 0.0001 for all estimates ).
R	Differences between the atypical antipsychotics were smaller than reported in other studies and may not be clinically significant.
C	This study confirms two results from the CATIE study: Patients with schizophrenia frequently do not achieve stable , long-term drug therapy regardless of the specific drug used , and olanzapine achieved longer TTAD than conventional drugs.
C	However , this study also found that patients treated with risperidone and quetiapine also achieved longer TTAD than patients treated with conventional antipsychotics.
B	Data on structural brain alterations in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) have been inconsistent.
B	Both ADHD and brain volumes have a strong genetic loading , but whether brain alterations in patients with ADHD are familial has been underexplored.
B	We aimed to detect structural brain alterations in adolescents and young adults with ADHD compared with healthy controls.
B	We examined whether these alterations were also found in their unaffected siblings , using a uniquely large sample.
M	We performed voxel-based morphometry analyses on MRI scans of patients with ADHD , their unaffected siblings and typically developing controls.
M	We identified brain areas that differed between participants with ADHD and controls and investigated whether these areas were different in unaffected siblings.
M	Influences of medication use , age , sex and IQ were considered.
R	Our sample included 307 patients with ADHD , 169 unaffected siblings and 196 typically developing controls ( mean age 17.2 [range 8-30] yr ).
R	Compared with-controls , participants with ADHD had significantly smaller grey matter volume in 5 clusters located in the precentral gyrus , medial and orbitofrontal cortex , and ( para ) cingulate cortices.
R	Unaffected siblings showed intermediate volumes significantly different from controls in 4 of these clusters ( all except the precentral-gyrus ).
R	Medication use , age , sex and IQ did not have an undue influence on the results.
R	-
C	Our sample was heterogeneous , most participants with ADHD were taking medication , and the comparison was cross--sectional.
C	Brain areas involved in decision-making , motivation , cognitive control and motor functioning were smaller in participants with ADHD than in controls.
C	Investigation of unaffected siblings indicated familiality of 4 of the structural brain differences , supporting their potential in molecular genetic analyses in ADHD research.
B	Gastroschisis , a congenital defect of the abdominal wall , occurs disproportionately more in offspring of young mothers and has been increasing in prevalence over the past decades.
B	A wide range of exposures have been reported in association with an increased gastroschisis risk , independent of mother's age ; many have also been correlated with stress responses.
M	We explored cumulative exposures to such stressor exposures among 1 ,261 mothers of gastroschisis cases and 10 ,682 mothers of controls in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study ( 1997-2011 ).
M	We considered 16 exposures as stressors in the first trimester: fever , genitourinary infection , anti-herpetic medication use , injury , bronchodilator use , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , illicit drug use , prescription opioid use , oral contraceptive use , interpregnancy interval < 12 months , residential move , aspirin use , ibuprofen use , venlafaxine use , and paroxetine use.
R	Mothers of cases reported more stressor exposures than controls.
R	For 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 stressor exposures compared with none , the age-adjusted odds ratios ( 95% confidence interval ) were 1.3 ( 1.1 , 1.6 ) , 1.7 ( 1.4 , 2.1 ) , 2.5 ( 2.0 , 3.1 ) , and 3.6 ( 2.9 , 4.4 ) , respectively.
R	When we weighted cumulative stress scores according to the magnitude of stressor-specific odds ratios , similar associations were observed.
R	Cumulative stressor exposure did not account for the strong inverse association between age and gastroschisis risk.
C	These findings show that gastroschisis risk appears to increase with accumulation of widely different types of exposures , consistent with the hypothesis that stress-induced inflammation might play an etiologic role.
B	In the U.S. civilian population , sex differences have been identified in cardiovascular health ; these differences have been used to inform care.
B	Our objective is to determine if the same sex differences are present in Veterans who use the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Health Care System given the additional stressors associated with military service.
M	Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors and conditions among women and men Veterans using VA in fiscal year ( FY ) 2014 were identified through the presence of International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM ) codes in VA administrative records.
M	ICD-9-CM codes were grouped into conditions ; prevalence was examined by gender overall , by age , and by race/ethnicity.
R	Within the FY 2014 cohort of VA Veteran patients included in this analysis , 7.1% ( n = 412 ,901 ) were women and 92.9% were men ( n = 5 ,376 ,749 ).
R	Compared with men , women in this cohort were younger and more ethnically diverse.
R	Overall , women were less likely to have traditional CVD risk factors , but more likely to have a nontraditional CVD risk factor ( depression ) compared with men.
R	Women had higher odds of chest pain/angina ( adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.03 , confidence interval [95% CI] 1.02-1.05 ) , palpitations ( AOR 2.04 ; 95% CI 1.98-2.10 ) , and valvular disease ( AOR 1.05 ; 95% CI 1.02-1.08 ) , but lower odds of coronary artery disease ( AOR 0.29 ; 95% CI 0.29-0.30 ) , acute MI ( AOR 0.46 ; 95% CI 0.43-0.49 ) , and heart failure ( AOR 0.55 ; 95% CI 0.53-0.56 ) compared with men , overall.
C	In age-adjusted comparisons , sex differences in the prevalence of CVD risk factors and conditions among the VA Veteran patient population was similar in that seen in the civilian population with a few exceptions.
B	Hospitalization presents a window of opportunity to treat smoking , and hospital-initiated smoking treatment has demonstrated effectiveness.
B	Despite effective interventions , not all smokers will discontinue use , highlighting the need to better understand which patients achieve cessation.
B	Traditional regression methods may not capture the complexity of inpatient smoker subgroups.
M	Latent class analysis ( LCA ) was conducted with data from 397 hospitalized adult cigarette smokers enrolled in a randomized trial.
M	Six categorical indicator variables known to impact cessation were selected to estimate subgroups: health conditions ( smoking-related disease [SRD] , depressive symptoms , positive screen for alcohol problems ) and smoking-related variables ( time to first cigarette , cigarettes/day , smoking indoors ).
M	The probability of achieving biologically verified 7-day tobacco cessation 6 months after discharged was estimated.
R	A 3-class model best fit the trial data: a Light Smokers subgroup had lower probability for most indicators ; a High Health Burden subgroup had high smoking behavior probabilities and similar health problems to the Light Smokers subgroup ; and a Heavy Smoking Drinking Depressed subgroup had high nicotine dependence , depressive symptoms , and alcohol misuse probabilities.
R	Probability of biologically verified cessation conditional on class membership was significantly higher ( P < .001 ) for the High Health Burden and the Light Smokers subgroups compared with the Heavy Smoking Drinking Depressed subgroup.
C	Results suggest that subgroups with lower probabilities of alcohol misuse and depression and higher probability of SRD had higher probability of successful cessation after hospital discharge.
C	Hospitalized patients with nicotine dependence combined with behavioral and mental health problems have additional cessation barriers that may require intervention focus.
P	This paper describes the use of a high-performance team model in the leadership of a healthcare construction project with a vision of fostering innovation in the design and building process.
P	This model facilitated the effective implementation of= Lean principles and a joint governance model combining stakeholders under a shared vision.

B	Because of state seismic safety legislation , the district elected to build a replacement hospital for its tertiary care trauma facility.
B	The organization's leadership decided to pursue a course that demanded innovation in both the design and construction process.
B	The owner , architects , construction manager , and trade contractors adopted a high-performance team model to meet this challenge.
B	Conclusions and
C	The governance and leadership of a construction project should reflect the design and ultimate intent of the facility.
C	The vision of building the most innovative hospital under constrained resources required the implementation of an innovative approach to leading the construction process.
B	Recent trends indicate research targeting outcomes of importance to people with disabilities , such as spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , may be best informed by those individuals ; however , there are very few published rehabilitation intervention studies that include people with disabilities in the research process in a role beyond study participant.
P	To describe a community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach to the development and pilot testing of an intervention using community-based Peer Navigators with SCI to provide health education to individuals with SCI , with the goal of reducing preventable secondary conditions and rehospitalizations , and improving community participation.
M	A CBPR framework guides the research partnership between academic researchers and a community-based team of individuals who either have SCI or provide SCI-related services.
M	Using this framework , the processes of our research partnership supporting the current study are described including: partnership formation , problem identification , intervention development , and pilot testing of the intervention.
M	Challenges associated with CBPR are identified.
R	Using CBPR , the SCI Peer Navigator intervention addresses the partnership's priority issues identified in the formative studies.
R	Utilization of the framework and integration of CBPR principles into all phases of research have promoted sustainability of the partnership.
R	Recognition of and proactive planning for challenges that are commonly encountered in CBPR , such as sharing power and limited resources , has helped sustain our partnership.
C	The CBPR framework provides a guide for inclusion of individuals with SCI as research partners in the development , implementation , and evaluation of interventions intended to improve outcomes after SCI.

P	The ovarian stimulating hormones used in In-Vitro Fertilization may increase the incidence of breast cancer.
P	Little research has been conducted to ascertain health professionals' knowledge or practices regarding this possible connection and if they communicate this risk to their patients.
P	This study described the knowledge , attitudes and practices of doctors and nurses regarding the causative link between In-Vitro Fertilization treatments and breast cancer , and to determine if these health professionals were assessing or communicating this possible risk to their patients.
M	Seventy gynecologists and nurses who worked in fertility clinics , had at least one year of experience in fertility and were literate in Hebrew were asked to complete the questionnaires.
M	Ten clinics around the country were contacted and the questionnaires were distributed and collected on the same day.
R	35 Nurses and 35 gynecologists completed the survey.
R	Although the majority of the physicians ( 68% ) and nurses ( 69% ) thought that there was a possible connection between the hormonal treatment of IVF and breast cancer , physicians were significantly more likely to inform their patients about the connection than were nurses.
C	There is a gap between the attitudes and practices of both physicians and nurses in communicating possible cancer risk to IVF clients.
C	It would be beneficial to create a standardized risk communication protocol that would include information and guidelines for practice.
C	More research must be conducted in this area , as there is almost no data on possible maternal risk from IVF treatment.

B	Disciplines differ in their authorship and citation practices , thus discipline-specific h-index norms are desirable.
B	Thus the goal of this study was to examine the relationship between the h-index and academic rank in the field of medical education , and the differences in the h-index between MD's and PhD's in this field.
M	Due to the absence of a formalized registry of medical educators , we sampled available editorial board membership ( considered a proxy for identifying 'career' medical educators ) to establish h-index values.
M	These were determined using Web of Science ( WoS ) and Google Scholar ( GS ) , and internet searching was used to determine their academic rank.
M	The correlation between authors' h-indices derived from WoS and GS was also determined.
R	130 editors were identified ( 95 full professors , 21 associate professors , 14 assistant professors ).
R	A significant difference was noted between the h-indices of full professors and associate/assistant professors ( p < .001 ).
R	Median h-indices equaled 14 for full professors ( Interquartile range [IQR] = 11 ) ; 7 for associate professors ( IQR = 7 ) and 6.5 for assistant professors ( IQR = 8 ).
R	h-indices of MD's and PhD's did not differ significantly.
R	Moderate correlation between GS and WOS h-indices was noted R = 0.46 , p < .001.
C	The results provide some guidance as to the expected h-indices of a select group of medical educators.
C	No differences appear to exist between assistant professor and associate professor ranks or between MD's and PhD's.
B	Caregivers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ( FASD ) have elevated levels of stress , which can negatively impact family functioning and caregivers' mental and physical health.
B	Self-care is a critical resource to address caregivers' stress.
P	This study describes strategies and obstacles related to self-care reported by caregivers of children with FASD.
P	It also examines how caregivers' perceived confidence in and frequency of self-care is related to stress , parenting attitudes , and family needs.
P	Methods & procedures: Forty-six caregivers of children with FASD identified self-care strategies and obstacles and rated their confidence and frequency of self-care.
P	Additional measures of perceived parenting efficacy , stress , family needs , child behavior , and family demographics were administered.
P	Correlation analyses examined associations between self-care and measures of child and family functioning.
R	Self-care strategies and obstacles were varied.
R	Greater reported confidence in self-care was associated with less parental distress and more satisfaction in the parenting role.
R	Frequency of self-care was positively associated with confidence in self-care but not with any other measure of family functioning.
C	Caregivers use a variety of strategies and face significant obstacles in self-care.
C	Confidence in self-care may be associated with lower stress and greater satisfaction in the parenting role.
P	This randomized , open , controlled , multicenter study ( 110886/NCT00578227 ) evaluated human papillomavirus ( HPV )-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine ( HPV-16/18 vaccine ) coadministered with inactivated hepatitis A and B ( HAB ) vaccine.
P	Coprimary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of hepatitis A , hepatitis B , and HPV-16/18 immune responses at month 7 when vaccines were coadministered , compared with the same vaccines administered alone.
M	Healthy girls ( 9-15 years ) were age-stratified ( 9 , 10-12 , and 13-15 years ) and randomized to receive HPV ( n = 270 ) , HAB ( n = 271 ) , or HPV + HAB ( n = 272 ).
M	Vaccines were administered at months 0 , 1 , and 6.
M	Immunogenicity was evaluated at months 0 and 7.
R	The hepatitis A immune response was noninferior for HPV + HAB , versus HAB , for seroconversion rates ( 100% in each group ) and geometric mean antibody titers ( GMTs ) ( 95% CI ) ( 4 ,504.2 [3 ,993.0-5 ,080.8] and 5 ,288.4 [4 ,713.3-5 ,933.7] mIU/mL , respectively ).
R	The hepatitis B immune response was noninferior for HPV + HAB , versus HAB , for anti-HBs seroprotection rates ( 98.3% and 100% ) ; GMTs were 3 ,136.5 [2 ,436.0-4 ,038.4] and 5 ,646.5 [4 ,481.3-7 ,114.6] mIU/mL , respectively.
R	The HPV-16/18 immune response was noninferior for HPV + HAB , versus HPV , for seroconversion rates ( 99.6% and 100% for both antigens ) and GMTs ( 22 ,993.5 [20 ,093.4-26 ,312.0] and 26 ,981.9 [23 ,909.5-30 ,449.1] EL.U/mL for HPV-16 ; 8 ,671.2 [7 ,651.7-9 ,826.6] and 11 ,182.7 [9 ,924.8-12 ,600.1] EL.U/mL for HPV-18 , respectively ).
R	No subject withdrew because of adverse events.
R	No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.
R	Immune responses and reactogenicity were similar in girls aged 9 years compared with the entire study population.
C	Results support coadministration of HPV-16/18 vaccine with HAB vaccine in girls aged 9-15 years.
C	The HPV-16/18 vaccine was immunogenic and generally well tolerated in 9-year-old girls.

B	This observational study followed a cohort of pregnant women during the 2010-2011 influenza season to determine factors associated with vaccination.
M	Participants were 1105 pregnant women who completed a survey assessing health beliefs related to vaccination upon enrollment and were then followed to determine vaccination status by the end of the 2010-2011 influenza season.
M	We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to explore factors associated with vaccination status and a factor analysis of survey items to identify health beliefs associated with vaccination.
R	Sixty-three percent ( n=701 ) of the participants were vaccinated.
R	In the univariate analyses , multiple factors were associated with vaccination status , including maternal age , race , marital status , educational level , and gravidity.
R	Factor analysis identified two health belief factors associated with vaccination: participant's positive views ( factor 1 ) and negative views ( factor 2 ) of influenza vaccination.
R	In a multivariate logistic regression model , factor 1 was associated with increased likelihood of vaccination ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.18 ; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.72-2.78 ) , whereas factor 2 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination ( aOR=0.36 ; 95% CI=0.28-0.46 ).
R	After controlling for the two health belief factors in multivariate analyses , demographic factors significant in univariate analyses were no longer significant.
R	Women who received a provider recommendation were about three times more likely to be vaccinated ( aOR=3.14 ; 95% CI=1.99-4.96 ).
C	Pregnant women's health beliefs about vaccination appear to be more important than demographic and maternal factors previously associated with vaccination status.
C	Provider recommendation remains one of the most critical factors influencing vaccination during pregnancy.
B	Risperidone is a common psychopharmacological treatment for irritability in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ).
B	It is not well-established how effective risperidone is across the initial symptom severity range.
B	This study aims to examine the influence of baseline severity on the efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of ASD.
M	Participants were from the NIMH funded RUPP multisite , randomized , double-blind trial that compared risperidone to placebo to treat autistic disorder with severe tantrums , aggression , or self-injury.
M	Participants were aged 5 to 17 , and randomly assigned to risperidone ( n = 49 ) or placebo ( n = 52 ).
M	Baseline and change scores were computed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) parent assessed scales with irritability as the primary outcome , as well as the clinician assessed ABC Irritability subscale , and Clinical Global Impression Scale.
R	The relationship between baseline severity and change scores for the risperdone and placebo groups was examined with eight competing three-level mixed-effects models for repeated measure models.
R	Significant ( P < 0.01 ) interactions between treatment and baseline severity were observed for parent ABC ratings of irritability and lethargy only.
R	Greater magnitudes of the differences between risperidone and placebo were observed from moderate to very severe baseline severity on irritability and lethargy.
R	Initial severity values over approximately 30 had a strong effect on symptom change [irritability: effect size ( ES ) = 1.9 , number needed to treat ( NNT ) = 2 , lethargy ES = 0.9 , NNT = 5].
C	Parents may expect benefits of risperidone on irritability and lethargy with moderate to severe symptoms of ASD.

P	This descriptive study examined differences in health quality of life ( HQoL ) and activity engagement in two groups of people with Parkinson's disease ( PD ): those who regularly participated in classes offered by the community-based program , Brooklyn Parkinson's Group ( BPg ) , and a comparison group.
P	Individuals in the comparison group did not participate in any community-based programs for people with PD , and were recruited from a clinic for PD and related disorders ( PDRD ) in an urban medical center.
M	We enrolled 26 participants ; 13 participants were recruited from BPg and 13 from PDRD Clinic.
M	Activity engagement was measured using the Activity Card Sort ( ACS ) and HQoL was measured using the PD Questionnaire ( PDQ-39 ).
M	Additionally , each participant completed a brief , interview-based questionnaire.
R	A statistically significant difference was found in ACS scores between the BPg and comparison groups.
R	BPg participants showed higher activity retention scores in all domains measured by the ACS.
R	There was no statistically significant difference in PDQ-39 scores.
C	This study provides preliminary evidence that regular participation in community programs like BPg may increase retention rates of activity engagement in people with PD.
C	Participation in BPg programs , though , was not shown to improve HQoL as measured by the PDQ-39.
B	The promotion of physical activity among young children has become a universal challenge.
B	Children spend large amounts of time in school , making it an attractive setting in which to promote positive health behaviors.
B	The purpose of this study was to investigate school-based physical activity behavior and its determinants in young Irish children.
M	Participants self-reported school-based free-play activity , commuting to school behavior , and levels of enjoyment of physical education and physical activity.
R	Data were collected from 605 children , mean age was 8.8 years ( +/- 2.2 ; range 5-14 years ) , 44% were female.
R	Thirty-nine percent of children actively commuted to school , with 40% of males compared with 34.8% of females walking to school.
R	Boys reported more physically active free-play activity ( 88.6% at break and 90.9% at lunch time ) compared with girls ( 70.8% and 83.7% respectively ).
R	Physical education was a top 3 favorite subject for 78% of children and 50.7% reported they would prefer to take part in more active pastimes directly after school.
C	Strategies for increasing active commuting are required.
C	Boys and girls are more alike than unlike in their behaviors and attitudes.
C	Teachers should capitalize on the fact that children's favorite subject is physical education to promote physical activity.
B	Disease Management Programmes ( DMPs ) are proposed to enhance the quality of care , to improve health outcomes and to reduce costs.
B	Yet , the evidence regarding the effectiveness of such structured approaches remains uncertain.
B	Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) represent the gold standard of evaluation for complex interventions.
B	However , most of the evidence derives from non-randomized or even uncontrolled trials.
B	We therefore tried to assess the impact of a randomized control group on the interpretation of DMP effectiveness.
M	We analyzed the data of a RCT on a DMP for diabetes type 2 by creating two scenarios.
M	The first solely includes data of the intervention group ( n = 649 ) , representing an 'uncontrolled pre-test-post-test analysis'.
M	The second comprehends all data ( n = 1489 ) of the 'randomized controlled analysis'.
M	HbA1c was used as the primary outcome measure for metabolic control in diabetes.
M	Depending on either scenario , we calculated relative and absolute risk reduction regarding clinically relevant endpoints and estimated costs by extrapolating our results according to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) findings.
R	The HbA1c reduction attributed to the DMP was 0.41% ( uncontrolled analysis ) vs. 0.13% ( controlled comparison ).
R	Estimations of relative risk reduction for cardiovascular disease were 4.6% vs. 1.4%.
R	The estimated numbers needed to treat ( NNT ) to avoid one myocardial infarction within 10 years differed from 125 ( uncontrolled analysis ) to 417 patients ( controlled comparison ) , which led to a substantial scenario-dependent difference in cost estimations.
C	Uncontrolled pre-test-post-test evaluation might lead to crucial overestimation of DMP effectiveness.
C	We therefore recommend randomized controlled evaluations prior to long-term implementation.
B	The Playworks program places coaches in low-income urban schools to engage students in physical activity during recess.
B	The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of Playworks on students' physical activity separately for Hispanic , non-Hispanic black , and non-Hispanic white students.
M	Twenty-seven schools from 6 cities were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.
M	Accelerometers were used to measure the intensity of students' physical activity , the number of steps taken , and the percentage of time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) during recess.
M	The impact of Playworks was estimated by comparing average physical activity outcomes in treatment and control groups.
R	Compared with non-Hispanic black students in control schools , non-Hispanic black students in Playworks schools recorded 338 more intensity counts per minute , 4.9 more steps per minute , and 6.3 percentage points more time in MVPA during recess.
R	Playworks also had an impact on the number of steps per minute during recess for Hispanic students but no significant impact on the physical activity of non-Hispanic white students.
C	The impact of Playworks was larger among minority students than among non-Hispanic white students.
C	One possible explanation is that minority students in non-Playworks schools typically engaged in less physical activity , suggesting that there is more room for improvement.
B	Empathy is a basic human ability with affective and cognitive facets and high interindividual variability.
B	Accurately detecting one's internal body signals ( interoceptive sensitivity ) strongly contributes to the awareness of oneself and is known to interact with emotional and cognitive processes.
B	This study investigated whether interoceptive sensitivity ( i.e. , heartbeat perception task ) shapes affective and cognitive empathy.
M	Ninety-three participants were asked to report the valence of their feelings , as well as the degree of compassion , arousal , and distress they felt in response to pictures depicting other people in pain or in non-pain situations.
M	Participants also had to estimate how painful the situation was.
R	Main results showed that greater interoceptive sensitivity enhanced the estimated degree of pain ( cognitive empathy ) , as well as arousal and feelings of compassion ( affective empathy ) , in response to painful pictures.
C	The accurate perception of bodily states and their representation shape both affective and cognitive empathy.
C	This perception enables us to feel more compassion for another person and to evaluate the pain that they experience as being more intense.

B	Age-appropriate child restraints and rear seating dramatically reduce injury in vehicle crashes.
B	Yet parents and caregivers struggle to comply with child passenger safety ( CPS ) recommendations , and frequently make mistakes when choosing and installing restraints.
B	The purpose of this research was to evaluate various methods of framing CPS recommendations , and to examine the relative effectiveness on parents' knowledge , attitudes , and behavioral intentions related to best practices and proper use of child restraints.
B	Emphasis framing is a persuasion technique that involves placing focus on specific aspects of the content in order to encourage or discourage certain interpretations of the content.
M	A 5 ( flyer group ) X 2 ( time ) randomized experiment was conducted in which 300 parent participants answered a pre-survey , viewed one of four flyer versions or a no-education control version , and completed a post-survey.
M	Surveys measured CPS knowledge , attitudes , perceptions of efficacy and risk , and behavioral intentions.
M	The four flyers compared in this study all communicated the same CPS recommendations , but several versions were tested which each employed a different emphasis frame: ( 1 ) recommendations organized by the natural progression of seat types ; ( 2 ) recommendations which focused on avoiding premature graduation ; ( 3 ) recommendations which explained the risk-reduction rationale behind the information given ; or ( 4 ) recommendations which were organized by age.
M	In a fifth no-education ( control ) condition , participants viewed marketing materials.
R	Analyses of covariance and pairwise comparisons indicated the risk-reduction rationale flyer outperformed other flyers for many subscales , and significantly differed from no-education control for the most subscales , including restraint selection , back seat knowledge , rear-facing knowledge and attitudes , total efficacy , overall attitudes , and stated intentions.
C	This research provides insight for increasing caregiver understanding and compliance with CPS information.
C	Recommendations for the field include communicating the rationale behind the information given , using behavior-based directives in headers , avoiding age-based headers , and incorporating back-seat positioning directives throughout.

B	Depression is the fourth-leading cause of global burden of disease , with prevalence rates ranging from 14% to 20 %.
B	Consequently , the development of programmes aimed at preventing the onset of depression is of great interest.
P	The aim of this study was the development and evaluation of an instrument to determine the quality of studies dealing with depression prevention.
P	The resulting scale consists of 20 criteria.
P	Based on this scale , 81 studies were determined by two independent raters.
R	The mean concordance of both raters was moderate ( k = .61 ).
C	The results indicate that the criteria are suitable to determine the methodical quality of programs aimed at preventing the onset of depression.
P	This research note explores the potential role of attention in mediating previously reported associations between language outcomes and prematurity.
M	As a follow-up investigation to Mahurin Smith , DeThorne , Logan , Channell , and Petrill ( 2014 ) , we employed multilevel modeling to analyze longitudinal data on language and attention collected when children were , on average , ages of 7 , 8 , and 10 years.
M	The sample of 114 children taken from the Western Reserve Reading and Math Project was selected to oversample children with a history of prematurity while also controlling for differences in confounding influences such as age , gender , parental education , and race.
R	As predicted , attention differentially predicted language outcomes based on form of measurement.
R	Specifically , parent and examiner ratings of attention were significantly associated with standardized test performance at all 3 time points ( R-2 = 15.2%-20% ).
R	Associations between attention and language sample measures were less consistent across home visits and tended to be smaller in effect size.
C	Attention abilities are associated with children's language performance even in the absence of an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis.
C	Clinical implications , particularly as related to assessment , are discussed.
B	Tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope is taught to medical students as it is a lifesaving procedure.
B	However , it is a difficult technique to learn and the consequences of intubation failure are potentially serious.
B	The Airtraq optical laryngoscope is a relatively novel intubation device , which allows visualization of the glottic plane without alignment of the oral , pharyngeal , and tracheal axes , possessing advantages over Macintosh for novice personnel.
B	We introduced a teaching mode featured with a progressive evaluation scheme for preparation and performance of tracheal intubation with medical students in this prospective randomized crossover trial who had no prior airway management experience to find the superior one.
M	Twenty-six medical students of the 8-year programme in the 6th year participated in this trial , when they did their one-week rotation in the department of anaesthesiology.
M	Each of the students intubated 6 patients , who were scheduled for surgeries under general anaesthesia , each laryngoscope for 3 patients respectively.
M	One hundred and forty-nine consecutive patients scheduled for surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled.
M	Patients were randomly allocated to undergo tracheal intubation using Macintosh ( n = 75 ) or Airtraq ( n = 74 ) laryngoscope.
M	The progressive evaluation scheme was applied to each intubation attempt.
R	Intubation success rate was significantly higher in Airtraq group than Macintosh group ( 87.8% vs. 66.7% , P < 0.05 ).
R	Duration of glottis exposure was significantly shorter in Airtraq group compared to Macintosh group ( 50 +/- 19 s vs. 81 +/- 27 s , P < 0.001 ).
R	A grade I Cormack and Lehane glottic view was obtained in 94.6% of patients in the Airtraq group versus 32% of patients in the Macintosh group ( P < 0.001 ).
R	Duration of intubation in Airtraq group was significantly shorter ( 68 +/- 21 s vs. 96 +/- 22 s , P < 0.05 ) compared to Macintosh group.
C	Airtraq laryngoscope is easier to master for novice personnel with a higher intubation success rate and shorter intubation duration compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope.
B	Hip osteoarthritis , a common age-associated condition , produces considerable disability that may be influenced by a variety of factors other than age.
B	This study examines the magnitude and impact of the presence of comorbid and/or concurrent depression and anxiety symptoms on the disability experienced before and immediately after total hip replacement surgery for end-stage osteoarthritisd-a very understudied , albeit potentially important area for improving the health and well-being of adults with this disabling condition.
M	The available records of 1 ,000 hip osteoarthritis surgical candidates were examined for any historical/concurrent evidence of depression/anxiety.
M	Additional data on medical comorbidities , pain , function , and discharge destination were extracted.
M	Selected subgroup comparisons between those with depression and anxiety disorder histories and those with no such history and their preoperative and immediate postoperative functional outcomes were conducted.
R	( 1 ) Nine percent ( 90 patients ) of the cohort reported having a prior mood disorder.
R	An additional 9% reported anxiety symptoms and 0.8% reported feeling depressed prior to surgery.
R	( 2 ) Those with depression and anxiety histories were more impaired before surgery and tended to recover more slowly than those with no such history ( p < .001 ).
R	( 3 ) Discharge destination , a surrogate functional measure , varied with the presence or absence of a depression or anxiety history.
C	Almost 20% of end-stage hip osteoarthritis cases undergoing replacement surgery may have mood disorder histories and/or prevailing symptoms of emotional distress that may exaggerate preoperative hip osteoarthritis disability and slow the postoperative recovery process.
C	Examining the cognitive as well as the physical status of adults undergoing hip replacement surgery for osteoarthritis and individualizing , rather than promoting generic intervention approaches , is indicated in efforts to optimize outcomes and minimize impairments and disability for adults with this condition.

P	This study provides the first nationally representative data on U.S. adults' perceptions of income sharing within families.
B	Modern couples confront tensions between ideals of mutual interests and values of economic autonomy , a departure from fitting themselves into culturally expected family arrangements of the past.
B	This study teases apart the conditions under which people might prioritize one cultural value over another.
M	The author conducted a nationally representative survey experiment ( N = 3 ,986 individuals ).
M	The respondents selected an income allocation arrangement for a fictional couple with varied relationships investments ( i.e. , marriage , parenthood , length of relationship ) and earning disparities.
R	Although stronger relationship investments were associated with greater support for sharing all income , the most commonly selected income allocation arrangement was a hybrid arrangement of sharing some income and keeping the rest separate.
R	When respondents preferred some amount of financial autonomy , the primary earner was expected to maintain ownership of a greater amount of the total household income.
R	The preferred level of withholding income was slightly larger in magnitude when women were shown as the primary earner when compared with men shown as the primary earner.
C	The pursuit of economic autonomy , in combination with beliefs about gender , are important dimensions of gender inequality located within families.
B	It has been hypothesized that adaptation of health practice guidelines to the local setting is expected to improve their uptake and implementation while cutting on required resources.
B	We recently adapted the published American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) treatment guideline to the Eastern Mediterranean Region ( EMR ).
B	The objective of this paper is to describe the process used for the adaptation of the 2015 ACR guideline on the treatment of RA for the EMR.
M	We used the GRADE-Adolopment methodology for the guideline adaptation process.
M	We describe in detail how adolopment enhanced the efficiency of the following steps of the guideline adaptation process: ( 1 ) groups and roles , ( 2 ) selecting guideline topics , ( 3 ) identifying and training guideline panelists , ( 4 ) prioritizing questions and outcomes , ( 5 ) identifying , updating or conducting systematic reviews , ( 6 ) preparing GRADE evidence tables and EtD frameworks , ( 7 ) formulating and grading strength of recommendations , ( 8 ) using the GRADEpro-GDT software.
R	The adolopment process took 6 months from January to June 2016 with a project coordinator dedicating 40% of her time , and the two co-chairs dedicating 5% and 10% of their times respectively.
R	In addition , a research assistant worked 60% of her time over the last 3 months of the project.
R	We held our face-to-face panel meeting in Qatar.
R	Our literature update included five newly published trials.
R	The certainty of the evidence of three of the eight recommendations changed: one from moderate to very low and two from low to very low.
R	The factors that justified a very low certainty of the evidence in the three recommendations were: serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision.
R	The strength of five of the recommendations changed from strong to conditional.
R	The factors that justified the conditional strength of these 5 recommendations were: cost ( n = 5 [100%] ) , impact on health equities ( n = 4 [80%] ) , the balance of benefits and harms ( n = 1 [20%] ) and acceptability ( n = 1 [20%] ).
C	This project confirmed the feasibility of GRADE-Adolopment.
C	It also highlighted the value of collaboration with the organization that had originally developed the treatment guideline.
C	We discuss the implications for both guideline adaptation and future research to advance the field.
P	To compare differences in psychosocial changes among experienced and first-time mothers over 6 postpartum weeks.
M	A trend research study design.
M	A cohort of 439 first-time mothers and 420 experienced mothers during the 6 postpartum weeks was recruited in southern Taiwan.
M	Each participant was interviewed over the phone to complete the Hung Postpartum Stress Scale , the Social Support Scale , and the Chinese Health Questionnaire.
R	Concern about lack of social support was significantly higher in first-time mothers in the third week than in the first week.
C	Postpartum stressors are different for inexperienced and experienced mothers , and these stressors vary in their importance over the 6 postpartum weeks , suggesting that the postpartum nursing needs of the two groups in 6 postpartum weeks may be different.
C	Implication for Practice: Knowledge and skills in mothering capability should be emphasized for first-time mothers , and physical exercises are needed for both groups of mothers.
B	Little is known about the preferences of at-risk Hispanic women to gain information on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ( HBOC ).
P	This study sought to qualitatively explore preferences for HBOC information among at-risk Mexican , Puerto Rican and Cuban women and to pilot a mock brochure aimed at Hispanic women.
M	Hispanic women aged 18-65 years with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer participated in a semi-structured interview.
M	Data were analyzed using a combination of open-coding and content analysis.
R	Fifty-three women participated in the study.
R	For the majority of content areas , there were no major differences between the subethnicities.
R	All women reported discussing cancer with a doctor after a family member had been diagnosed and discussing cancer within their families ; however , the content of the discussion varied.
R	Cuban and Puerto Rican women reported using the Internet routinely for health care information while Mexican women said they did not have access to computers and did not use them.
R	All women liked the content and photos in the brochure but Mexican women thought the reading level was too high.
R	Preferences for the spokesperson focused on the need for Spanish-speaking health care providers.
C	While the data show some similarities , such as patterns of cancer discussion and appreciation of the mock brochure , there were differences between the groups on information preferences.
C	In designing HBOC education information for Hispanic audiences , it is important to consider varied channels for dissemination and preferences for specific types of information across subethnicities.

B	In Israel , an average of 37 children are born each year with sepsis and another four with meningitis as a result of Group B Streptococcal ( GBS ) disease.
B	Israel currently only screens mothers with defined risk factors ( around 15% of all pregnancies ) in order to identify candidates for Intrapartum Antiobiotic Prophyhlaxis ( IAP ) of GBS.
B	This paper presents a cost-utility analysis of implementing an alternative strategy , which would expand the current protocol to one aiming to screen all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks gestation based on taking a vaginal culture for GBS.
M	A spreadsheet model was built incorporating technical , epidemiological , health service costs , demographic and economic data based primarily on Israeli sources.
R	The intervention of universal screening ( compared with the current scenario ) would increase screening costs from 580 ,000 NIS to 3 ,278 ,000 million NIS.
R	In addition , the intervention would also increase penicillin costs from 39 ,000 NIS to 221 ,000 NIS.
R	Current culture screening of approximately 15% of mothers-to-be with high risk factors resulted in 42 GBS births in 2008-9 ( 0.253/1000 births ).
R	Expanding culture screening to 85% of mothers-to-be , will decrease the number of GBS births to 17.3 ( 0.104/1000 births ).
R	The initial 2.9 million NIS incremental intervention costs are offset by decreased treatment costs of 1.9 million NIS and work productivity gains of 811 ,000 NIS as a result of a decrease in neurological sequelae from GBS caused meningitis.
R	Thus the resultant net cost of the intervention is only around 134 ,000 NIS.
R	Culture based screening will reduce the burden of disease by 12.6 discounted Quality Adjusted Life Years ( QALYS ) , giving a very cost effective baseline incremental cost per QALY ( cf. risk factor screening ) of 10 ,641 NIS per QALY.
R	The data was very sensitive to rates of anaphylactic shock and changes in the percentage of meningitis cases that had associated long term-sequelae.
C	It is recommended that Israel adopt universal culture-based GBS screening.
P	Models of speech production often abstract away from shared physiology in pitch control and lingual articulation , positing independent control of tone and vowel units.
P	We assess the validity of this assumption in Mandarin Chinese by evaluating the stability of lingual articulation for vowels across variation in tone.
M	Electromagnetic articulography was used to track flesh points on the tongue ( tip , body , dorsum ) , lips , and jaw while native Mandarin speakers ( n = 6 ) produced 3 vowels ,/pa/ , /pi/ , /pu/ , combined with 4 Mandarin tones: T1 "high ," T2 " rising ," T3 " low ," and T4 "falling."
R	Consistent with physiological expectations , tones that begin low , T ( 2 ) over bar and T ( 3 ) over bar , conditioned a lower position of the tongue body for the vowel /a/.
R	For the vowel /i/ , we found the opposite effect , whereby tones that begin low , T2 and T3 , conditioned a higher tongue body position.
C	The physiology of pitch control exerts systematic variation on the lingual articulation of /a/ across tones.
C	The effects of tone on /i/ articulation are in the opposite direction predicted by physiological considerations.
C	Physiologically arbitrary variation of the type observed for /i/ challenges the assumption that phonetic patterns can be determined by independent control of tone ( source ) and vowel ( filter ) production units.
B	Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity ( PSH ) produces symptoms of autonomic instability and muscle over-activity ; however , the majority of nursing interventions used in clinical practice are anecdotal and not evidenced based.
P	The primary objective was to report nursing documentation of PSH events , and to describe the clinical nursing interventions and care provided to children who have suffered a severe brain injury and are exhibiting PSH.
P	The secondary objective was to demonstrate how the Symptom Management Theory ( SMT ) can serve as a framework for research related to brain injury and PSH.
M	The study consisted of a retrospective chart review of nursing progress notes using direct content analysis.
M	The nested sample of ten randomly selected charts was chosen from a larger quantitative study of 83 children who had suffered severe brain injuries with and without PSH.
M	Textual analysis of verbatim nursing progress notes was used to describe nursing interventions that were used and documented for this patient population.
R	The priority nursing interventions to manage these symptoms included medication administration , facilitation of family presence , and strategies to target auditory , tactile , and visual stimuli.
R	The sample received different individual interventions for PSH.
R	Additionally , individual subjects demonstrated different patterns of interventions.
C	While tactile interventions were documented most frequently , there was not a uniform approach to interventions.
C	The SMT can be useful to provide a framework that organizes and tests clinical care and management of PSH strategies.

B	This study was conducted to assess the quantity , quality , and reach of e-cigarette health effects YouTube videos and to quantify the description of positive and negative e-cigarette health effects and promotional content in each video.
M	Searches for videos were conducted in 2015 using the YouTube search engine , and the top 20 search results by relevance and view count were identified.
M	Videos were classified by educational/medical/news , advertising/marketing , and personal/testimonial categories.
M	A coding sheet was used to assess the presence or absence of negative and positive health effects and promotional content.
R	Of the 320 videos retrieved , only 55 unique videos were included.
R	The majority of videos ( 46.9% ) were educational/medical/news , 29.7% were personal/testimonial , and 23.4% were advertising/marketing.
R	The three most common negative health effects included discussing nicotine , e-cigarettes not being FDA regulated , and known and unknown health consequences related to e-cigarette use.
R	The top positive health effects discussed were how e-cigarettes can help individuals quit smoking , e-cigarettes are healthier than smoking , and e-cigarettes have no smoke or secondhand smoke exposure.
C	It is critical to monitor YouTube health effects content and develop appropriate messages to inform consumers about the risks associated with use while mitigating misleading information presented.
B	In individual cognitive behavioral therapy ( ICBT ) for youth anxiety disorders , it is unclear whether , and from whose perspective , the alliance predicts outcome.
B	We examined whether youth-and therapist-rated alliance , including level of youth-therapist alliance agreement , predicted outcome in a randomized controlled trial.
M	Youth ( N = 91 , M age = 11.4 years ( SD = 2.1 ) , 49.5% boys , 86.8% Caucasian ) diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder , social phobia , or generalized anxiety disorder drawn from the ICBT condition of an effectiveness trial were treated with an ICBT program.
M	Youth-and therapist-rated alliance ratings , assessed with the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children ( TASC-C/T ) , were collected following session 3 ( early ) and 7 ( late ).
M	Early alliance , change in alliance from early to late , and level of youth-therapist agreement on early alliance and alliance change were examined , in relation to outcomes collected at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up.
M	Outcome was defined as primary diagnosis loss and reduction in clinicians' severity ratings ( CSR ; Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule ; ADIS-C/P ) based on youth-and parent-report at posttreatment and follow-up , and youth treatment satisfaction collected at posttreatment ( Client Satisfaction Scale ; CSS ).
R	Early TASC-C scores positively predicted treatment satisfaction at posttreatment.
R	Higher levels of agreement on change in TASC-C and TASC-T scores early to late in treatment predicted diagnosis loss and CSR reduction at follow-up.
C	Only the level of agreement in alliance change predicted follow-up outcomes in ICBT for youth anxiety disorders.
C	The findings support further examination of the role that youth-therapist alliance discrepancies may play in promoting positive outcomes in ICBT for youth anxiety disorders.
P	To present normative values of mean sleep duration from adolescence through young adulthood ( ages 13-32 years ) , prevalence of short ( <6 hours ) and long ( >10 hours ) sleep durations , and differences in each by sex and race/ethnicity.
M	Mean sleep duration and prevalence of extremely short and long sleep were estimated using data from the United States National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , Waves 1-4 ( N = 15 ,701 ).
R	Sleep duration showed age-related trends , with decreases across the adolescent period from 8.5 hours per night at age 13 years to 7.3 hours at age 18 years , an increase through the emerging adulthood period to 8.5 hours at age 22 , and a gradual decline across early adulthood to 7.7 hours at age 32 years.
R	Prevalence of extremely long and short sleep followed similar developmental trends.
R	Adolescent girls reported lower mean sleep duration than did boys , but women reported longer average sleep duration than did men from age 19 years onward.
R	Short sleep duration was most common among African-Americans at all ages.
R	Long sleep was most common among African-Americans in adolescence and emerging adulthood and among Hispanics in early adulthood.
C	Sleep duration is developmentally patterned from adolescence through early adulthood.
C	Mean and extreme sleep durations vary systematically by sex and race/ethnicity as well as age.
C	These normative data on sleep duration will inform studies of the role of sleep in the etiology of a wide range of health conditions affecting adolescents and young adults.

B	Social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) is highly comorbid with alcohol use disorders ( AUD ) yet the nature of this comorbidity remains unclear To better understand these associations , we first examined whether SAD was related to AUD above and beyond relevant covariates.
B	Second , we examined the psychosocial impairment associated with the comorbidity of SAD and AUD versus SAD without AUD.
B	Third , the temporal sequencing of SAD and AUD among comorbid individuals was examined.
M	Participants included 5 , 877 ( 50% females ) adults from the National Comorbidity Survey.
R	As predicted , SAD was related to alcohol dependence ( not abuse ) after controlling for relevant conditions' indicating that SAD is linked to more severe alcohol impairment and that this link is not better accounted for by other pathology.
R	Results also supported the hypothesis that the addition of alcohol dependence to SAD resulted in greater impairment across a variety of domains relative to SAD without alcohol dependence ( e.g. , greater rates of health care utilization , other psychiatric diagnoses , health problems , and greater interpersonal stress ).
R	Additionally , for the majority of comorbid individuals , SAD onset predated alcohol dependence onset , suggesting SAD increases vulnerability for misusing alcohol.
C	Together , these data lend support for the contention that SAD may serve as a risk for alcohol dependence and indicate that the co-occurrence of these two conditions ,may result in greater personal and public health care costs.

B	Many women consider mammography painful.
B	Existing studies on pain-preventing strategies only mention pain scores reported before and after breast compression.
B	Studying the pain dynamics during the entire compression cycle may provide new insights for effective pain-preventing strategies.
M	This observational study included 117 women who consented to use a custom turning knob to indicate their pain experience during standard mammographic breast compressions in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam , The Netherlands.
M	The breast thickness , compression force , contact area , contact pressure and pain experience were recorded continuously.
M	Breast volume was calculated retrospectively from the mammograms.
M	We visualized the progression of pain in relation to breast mechanics for five groups of breast volumes and we performed multivariable regressions to identify factors that significantly predict pain experience.
R	Breast compressions consisted of a deformation phase for flattening , and a clamping phase for immobilization.
R	The clamping phase lasted 12.8 +/- 3.6 seconds ( average +/- standard deviation ) , 1.7 times longer than the 7.5 +/- 2.6 seconds deformation phase.
R	During the clamping phase , the average pain score increased from 4.75 to 5.88 ( +24% ) on a 0 - 10 Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) , and the proportion of women who reached severe pain ( NRS >= 7 ) increased from 23% to 50% ( more than doubled ).
R	Moderate pain ( NRS >= 4 ) was reported up to four days after the mammogram.
R	Multivariable analysis showed that pain recollection of the previous mammogram and breast pain before the compression , are significant predictors for pain.
R	Women with smallest breasts experienced most pain: They received highest contact pressures ( force divided by contact area ) and the pressure increased at the highest rate.
C	We suggest further research on two pain-preventing strategies: 1 ) using a personalized compression protocol by applying to all breasts the same target pressure at the same , slow rate , and 2 ) shortening the phase during which the breast is clamped.
B	Religiosity is associated with improved treatment outcomes among adults with alcohol dependence ; however , it is unknown whether religious coping predicts drinking outcomes above and beyond the effects of coping in general , and whether gender differences exist.
M	We assessed 116 alcohol-dependent adults ( 53% women ; mean age = 37 , SD = 8.6 ) for use of religious coping , general coping , and alcohol use within 2 weeks of entering outpatient treatment , and again 6 months after treatment.
R	Religious coping at 6 months predicted fewer heavy alcohol use days and fewer drinks per day.
R	This relationship was no longer significant after controlling for general coping at 6 months.
C	The relationship between the use of religious coping strategies and drinking outcomes is not independent of general coping.
C	Coping skills training that includes religious coping skills , as one of several coping methods , may be useful for a subset of adults early in recovery.
C	This novel , prospective study assessed the relationship between religious coping strategies , general coping , and treatment outcomes for alcohol-dependent adults in treatment with results suggesting that the use of religious coping as one of several coping methods may be useful for a subset of adults early in recovery.
B	Men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , particularly young black MSM , are disproportionately affected in the United States' HIV epidemic.
B	Drug use may contribute to these disparities , yet previous studies have failed to provide evidence of elevated use among black MSM , relying exclusively on self-reported usage.
B	This study uses biological assays to validate self-reports of drug use and explore the potential for misclassification to distort findings on racial patterns of use in this population.
M	From an Atlanta-based cohort study of 454 black and 349 white MSM from 2010 to 2012 , participants' self-reported drug use was compared to urine drug screening findings.
M	The sensitivity of self-report was calculated as the proportion reporting recent usage among those who screened positive.
M	Multivariable regression models were constructed to examine racial patterns in self-report , urine-detection , and self-report sensitivity of marijuana and cocaine usage , adjusted for socio-demographic factors.
R	In analyses that adjusted for age , education , income , sexual orientation , and history of arrest , black MSM were less likely to report recent use of marijuana ( P < 0.001 ) and cocaine ( P= 0.02 ) , but equally likely to screen positive for either drug.
R	This discrepancy between self-reported and urine-detected drug use was explained by significantly lower sensitivity of self-report for black participants ( P < 0.001 for marijuana , P < 0.05 for cocaine ).
C	The contribution of individual drug-related risk behaviors to the HIV disparities between black and white MSM should be revisited with methods that validate self-reports of illegal drug use.

B	Children with probable developmental coordination disorder ( pDCD ) experience motor problems that negatively influence their self-perceptions and increase the risk to develop overweight due to physical inactivity.
B	Whether overweight in children with pDCD has an additional impact on their self-perceptions is unclear.
B	Insight in this impact would provide vital information for diagnostics and interventions to enhance physical activity in children with pDCD and overweight.
P	Investigate differences in self-perceptions between children with pDCD and overweight ( pDCD-O ) , children with pDCD without overweight ( pDCD-NO ) , and typically developing children ( TD ).
M	A total of 366 children ( 188 boys/178 girls ) , aged between 7 and 13 years , participated in this study.
M	Thirteen children were categorized as pDCD-O , 51 children as pDCD-NO , and 302 children as TD.
M	Self-perceptions were assessed with the Self-Perception Profile for Children.
R	Children with pDCD-O perceived themselves lower in social acceptance than children with pDCD-NO and TD children.
R	Children with pDCD-NO perceived themselves lower in athletic competence than TD children , but not than children with pDCD-O.
R	No differences were found for perceived physical appearance and global self-esteem.
C	Overweight has an additional negative impact on perceived social acceptance in children with pDCD.
B	Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) is a serious mental health condition with substantial costs to individuals and society.
B	Among military veterans , the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been estimated to be as high as 20%.
B	Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies , such as Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) , lead to substantial and sustained improvements in PTSD symptoms.
B	Despite known benefits , only a minority of clinicians provide these therapies.
B	Transferring this research knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health of veterans with PTSD.
B	Attending a workshop alone is insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skill ; however , relatively little research has been conducted to identify effective post-training support strategies.
M	The current study investigates whether clinicians receiving post-workshop support ( six-month duration ) will deliver CPT with greater fidelity ( i.e. , psychotherapy adherence and competence ) and have improved patient outcomes compared with clinicians receiving no formal post-workshop support.
M	The study conditions are: technology-enhanced group tele-consultation ; standard group tele-consultation ; and fidelity assessment with no consultation.
M	The primary outcome is independent assessment ( via audio-recordings ) of the clinicians' adherence and competence in delivering CPT.
M	The secondary outcome is observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment as a function of clinician fidelity.
M	Post-consultation interviews with clinicians will help identify facilitators and barriers to psychotherapy skill acquisition.
M	The study results will inform how best to implement and transfer evidence-based psychotherapy ( e. g. , CPT ) to clinical settings to attain comparable outcomes to those observed in research settings.
C	Findings will deepen our understanding of how much and what type of support is needed following a workshop to help clinicians become proficient in delivering a new protocol.
C	Several influences on clinician learning and patient outcomes will be discussed.
C	An evidence-based model of clinical consultation will be developed , with the ultimate goal of informing policy and influencing best practice in clinical consultation.
P	To explore the efficacy of a word learning intervention for late-talking toddlers that is based on principles of cross-situational statistical learning.
M	Four late-talking toddlers were individually provided with 7-10 weeks of biweekly word learning intervention that incorporated principles of cross-situational statistical learning.
M	Treatment was input-based meaning that , aside from initial probes , children were not asked to produce any language during the sessions.
M	Pre-intervention data included parent-reported measures of productive vocabulary and language samples.
M	Data collected during intervention included production on probes , spontaneous production during treatment , and parent report of words used spontaneously at home.
M	Data were analyzed for number of target words learned relative to control words , effect sizes , and pre-post treatment vocabulary measures.
R	All children learned more target words than control words and , on average , showed a large treatment effect size.
R	Children made pre-post vocabulary gains , increasing their percentile scores on the MCDI , and demonstrated a rate of word learning that was faster than rates found in the literature.
C	Cross-situational statistically based word learning intervention has the potential to improve vocabulary learning in late-talking toddlers.
C	Limitations on interpretation are also discussed.
C	Learning outcomes: Readers will describe what cross-situational learning is and how it might apply to treatment.
C	They will identify how including lexical and contextual variability in a word learning intervention for toddlers affected treatment outcomes.
C	They will also recognize evidence of improved rate of vocabulary learning following treatment.

P	The aim of this study was to determine factors independently associated with successful rehabilitation of patients with lower limb amputation in skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs ).
M	All patients admitted to one of the 11 participating SNFs were eligible.
M	Multidisciplinary teams collected the data.
M	Successful rehabilitation was defined as discharge to an independent living situation within 1 year after admission.
M	Functional status at discharge , as measured with the Barthel index ( BI ) , was a secondary outcome.
M	Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the independent contribution of each determinant to the two outcome measures.
R	Of 55 eligible patients , 48 were included.
R	Mean age was 75 years.
R	Sixty-five percent rehabilitated successfully.
R	Multivariate analyses showed that presence of diabetes mellitus ( DM ) ( OR 23.87 , CI 2.26-252.47 ) and premorbid BI ( OR 1.37 , CI 1.10-1.70 ) were the most important determinants of successful rehabilitation , whereas 78% of the variance of discharge BI was explained by premorbid BI , BI on admission , and 1-leg balance.
C	The presence of DM and high premorbid BI were associated with discharge to an independent living situation within 1 year after admission.
C	Premorbid BI , admission BI , and 1-leg balance were independently associated to discharge BI.
B	Fluent speakers and people who stutter manifest alterations in autonomic and emotional responses as they view stuttered relative to fluent speech samples.
B	These reactions are indicative of an aroused autonomic state and are hypothesized to be triggered by the abrupt breakdown in fluency exemplified in stuttered speech.
B	Furthermore , these reactions are assumed to be the basis for the stereotypes held by different communicative partners towards people who stutter.
P	To examine the autonomic and emotional reactions of graduate student clinicians in speechlanguage pathology as they viewed fluent and severe stuttered speech samples.
M	Twenty-one female graduate student clinicians in speechlanguage pathology participated in this study.
M	Each participant viewed four 30-s video samples ( two fluent and two stuttered speech samples ) while their autonomic responses ( skin conductance response ( SCR ) and heart rate ( HR ) ) were concurrently captured.
M	Furthermore , emotional responses to stuttered and fluent speech samples were captured using the self-assessment manikin ( SAM ) and a rating scale with nine bipolar adjectives reflecting one's feelings.
R	An increase in SCR and deceleration in HR was observed as graduate clinicians viewed stuttered speech samples versus fluent speech samples and the differences were statistically significant.
R	In addition , results from the self-rating scales showed that participants had negative feelings ( e.g. , emotionally aroused , unpleasant , embarrassed , uncomfortable , etc. ) while viewing stuttered speech.
C	Findings suggest that graduate student clinicians in speechlanguage pathology demonstrated altered autonomic and emotional responses similar to those manifested by fluent and stuttered speakers as they viewed stuttered speech samples.
C	Collectively , these findings support the contention that the inherent nature of stuttered speech triggers a visceral reaction in a listener , irrespective of their background and knowledge about the disorder.
B	Negative biases in the interpretation of ambiguous material have been linked to anxiety and mood problems.
B	Accumulating data from adults show that positive and negative interpretation styles can be induced through cognitive bias modification ( CBM ) paradigms with accompanying changes in mood.
B	Despite the therapeutic potential of positive training effects , training paradigms have not yet been explored in adolescents.
M	Eighty-two healthy adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) were randomly allocated to either positive or negative CBM training.
M	To assess training effects on interpretation bias , participants read ambiguous situations followed by test sentences with positive or negative interpretations of the situation.
M	Participants rated the similarity of these sentences to the previously viewed ambiguous situations.
M	Training effects on negative and positive affect were assessed using visual analogue scales before and after training.
R	After training , adolescents in the negative condition drew more negative and fewer positive interpretations of new ambiguous situations than adolescents in the positive condition.
R	Within the positive condition , adolescents endorsed more positive than negative interpretations.
R	In terms of mood changes , positive training resulted in a significant decrease in negative affect across participants , while the negative condition led to a significant decrease in positive affect among male participants only.
C	This is the first study to demonstrate the plasticity of interpretation bias in adolescents.
C	The immediate training effects on mood suggest that it may be possible to train a more positive interpretation style in youth , potentially helping to protect against anxiety and depressive symptoms.
B	In response to the growing concern about healthcare-associated infections ( HAIs ) , US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) developed the National Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-associated Infections.
B	A key focus of the Action Plan is the setting of HAI metrics and targets and the enhancement and development of data systems to support HAI surveillance.
P	To identify and assess the strengths and weaknesses of HHS data systems available for surveillance of catheter-associated urinary tract infections , surgical site infections , and Clostridium difficile infections.
P	To present national data from each of the data systems and assess concordance in trends over time.
M	Literature review on data system characteristics and HAI measurement.
M	Graphical and descriptive analyses of longitudinal HAI rates from HHS data systems.
M	HAI rate information expressed as prevalence rates or standardized infection ratios.
R	We identified four HHS data systems-Medicare claims data , Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project , Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System , and National Healthcare Safety Network-capable of surveillance of at least one of the HAIs under study.
R	Surgical site infection and Clostridium difficile infection rates display concordance in trends , although there is no evidence of concordance in catheter-associated urinary tract infections rates.
R	We have identified a number of desirable HAI data system characteristics: clinically valid ; provide information on a broad range of HAIs ; have large sample size to support statistical inference ; be representative of the United States ; and display consistency in cohort , surveillance protocols , and data collection methodology.
C	Although the data systems included in this study vary along the desirable data system dimensions we identified , trends in HAI rates are generally concordant across the data systems.
C	This increases confidence in observed trends.
B	Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is an auto-immune connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis of skin , blood vessels , and internal organs that results in significant disability.
P	To identify the work barriers faced by people with systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) in maintaining employment.
M	Thirty-six people with SSc who were working more than 8 hours per week completed the Work Experience Survey , which contains lists of potential work barriers , including the ability to travel to and from work ; get around at work ; perform essential job functions , including physical , cognitive , and task-related activities ; work with others ; and manage work conditions.
R	Thirty-three participants completed and returned the questionnaires , most of whom were female , and working full time and in professional careers.
R	Principal disease symptoms included fatigue , Raynaud's phenomenon , esophageal involvement , and leg or hand/wrist pain.
R	All participants reported some barriers with a mean of 18 barriers per participant.
R	At least three quarters of participants cited outside temperature ( 82% ) , cold temperatures inside the workplace ( 76% ) , and household work ( 76% ) , as barriers.
R	The next most common barriers were using both hands ( 64% ) , arranging and taking part in social activities ( 64% ) , being able to provide self-care ( 61% ) and working 8 hours ( 58% ).
C	Participants reported a wide range of barriers , from cold temperatures , to physical job , fatigue related , and non-workplace demands , in maintaining the worker role.
C	The barriers reflect the disease symptoms they reported.
C	Identifying workplace barriers facilitates the creation of job accommodations or adaptations that will allow people with SSc to continue working.
B	The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) is a widely used self-report measure to assess emotional distress in clinical populations.
B	As highlighted in recent review studies , the latent structure of the HADS is still an issue.
B	The aim of this study was to analyze the factorial structure of the HADS in a large community sample in Italy , and to test the invariance of the best fitting model across age and gender groups.
M	Data analyses were carried out on a sample of 1.599 participants proportionally stratified according to the Italian census population pyramid.
M	Participants aged 18 to 85 years ( females = 51.8% ) , living in eight different regions of Italy , voluntarily participated in the study.
M	The survey questionnaire contained the HADS , Health Status questions , and sociodemographic variables.
R	Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a bifactor model , with a general psychological distress factor and two orthogonal group factors with anxiety and depression , was the best fitting one compared to six alternative factor structures reported in the literature , with overall good fit indices [Non-normed Fit Index ( NNFI ) = .97 ; Comparative Fit Index ( CFI ) = .98 ; Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation ( RMSEA ) = .04].
R	Multi-group analyses supported total invariance of the HADS measurement model for males and females , and for younger ( i.e. , 18-44 years old ) and older ( i.e. , 45-85 years old ) participants.
R	Our descriptive analyses showed that females reported significant higher anxiety and general distress mean scores than males.
R	Moreover , older participants reported significant higher HADS , anxiety and depression scores than younger participants.
C	The results of the present study confirmed that the HADS has good psychometric properties in an Italian community sample , and that the HADS scores , especially the general psychological distress one , can be reliably used for assessing age and gender differences.
C	In keeping with the most recent factorial studies , our analysis supported the superior fit of a bifactor model.
C	However , the high factor loadings on the general factor also recommend caution in the use of the two subscales as independent measures.
P	In recent years , large numbers of children have been adopted from abroad into the United States.
P	This has prompted an interest in understanding and improving the developmental outcomes for these children.
P	Although a growing number of studies have investigated the early language development of children who have been adopted internationally , few have focused specifically on the phonological processing development of this group of children , even though it is widely acknowledged that phonological processing skills are important in language and literacy acquisition.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the phonological processing skills of a group of children who had been adopted from China into the United States.
M	The participants were 45 children who had been adopted from China ( M-age at adoption = 13.09 months ).
M	The children were assessed between the ages of 6 ; 10 (  years ; months ) and 9 ; 4.
M	Their phonological processing skills , spoken language skills , and reading comprehension skills were assessed using norm-referenced measures.
R	Overall , the majority of children scored at or above the average ranges across measures of phonological awareness , phonological memory , and rapid naming.
R	The children's reading comprehension scores were moderately to highly correlated with their phonological processing scores , but age at the time of adoption was not highly correlated with phonological processing or reading comprehension.
C	The findings of the current study provide a basis for an optimistic view regarding the later language and literacy development of school-age children who were internationally adopted by the age of 2 years.
B	The authors tested three possible pathways linking prenatal maternal depressive symptoms to adolescent depressive symptoms.
B	These pathways went through childhood Irritability Symptoms , Anxiety/Depressive Symptoms or Conduct Problems.
M	Data were collected from 3 ,963 mother-child pairs participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.
M	Measures include maternal depressive symptoms ( pre- and postnatal ) ; toddler temperament ( 2 years ) ; childhood ( 7-13 years ) irritability symptoms , anxiety/depressive symptoms , conduct problems , and adolescent depressive symptoms ( 16 years ).
R	Irritability Symptoms: This pathway linked sequentially - prenatal maternal depressive symptoms , toddler temperament ( high perceived intensity and low perceived adaptability ) , childhood irritability symptoms , and adolescent depressive symptoms.
R	Anxiety/Depressive symptoms: This pathway linked sequentially -prenatal maternal depressive symptoms , toddler temperament ( negative perceived mood ) , childhood anxiety/depressive symptoms , and adolescent depressive symptoms.
R	Childhood conduct problems were not associated with adolescent depressive symptoms , above and beyond irritability symptoms and anxiety/depressive symptoms.
C	Results suggest evidence for two distinct developmental pathways to adolescent depressive symptoms that involve specific early and midchildhood features.
P	Variability in frequency of stuttering has made the results of treatment outcome studies difficult to interpret.
P	Many factors that affect variability have been investigated ; yet the typical range of variability experienced by speakers remains unknown.
P	This study examined the day-to-day variability in the percentage of syllables containing stuttered and nonstuttered disfluencies in the speech of six adult speakers in three spontaneous speaking situations and two reading tasks.
M	The frequency of moments stuttering during the tasks were compared within and between speakers and days to document the degree of variability in stuttering frequency and explore whether there were any consistent patterns.
M	The Stuttering Severity Instrument-Fourth Edition ( SSI-4 ) and Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering for Adults ( OASES-A ) were also tested for day-to-day variability.
M	Correlations between frequency , severity , and life impact were made.
R	The primary result of this study was the large range over which frequency of stuttering varied from day to day for the same individual.
R	This variability did not correlate with any measures of stuttering severity but did correlate with life impact as measured by the OASES-A.
R	No global pattern was detected in variability from day to day within or between participants.
R	However , there were significantly more nonstuttered disfluencies present during the spontaneous speaking tasks than during the reading tasks.
R	The day-to-day variability in the life impact of the disorder ( OASES-A ) was less than the day-to-day variability in observable stuttering behavior ( percentage of syllables stuttered and SSI-4 ).
C	Frequency of stuttering varies significantly from situation to situation and day to day , with observed variability exceeding the degree of change often reported in treatment outcomes studies from before to after treatment.
C	This variability must be accounted for in future clinical and scientific work.

B	Raising a child with intellectual disability ( ID ) may be stressful for parents.
B	Previous studies have suggested the mediating role of mindfulness in the association between child behavior problems and parental stress.
P	The present study examined whether this mediating role is a result of parents' self-report bias.
P	It also explored whether mindfulness has a moderating role instead when child behavior problems are reported by teachers.
M	In a questionnaire survey , 271 Chinese parents of children with ID in 6 Hong Kong special schools reported their levels of stress and mindfulness , as well as their children's behavior problems.
M	The latter was also reported by teachers.
R	When child behavior problems were reported by parents , parental mindfulness was a mediator between child behavior problems and parental stress.
R	In contrast , when child behavior problems were reported by teachers , parental mindfulness was a moderator between child behavior problems and parental stress.
C	The mediation role of mindfulness maybe an artifact of measurement.
C	The findings provide an encouraging message that parenting a child with ID and behavior problems does not necessarily mean more stress among all parents.
C	Parents with a high level of mindfulness may experience less stress than those with a low level of mindfulness.
B	Carrying a load in hand is commonly seen in daily life.
B	There were many studies investigating the optimal weight when carrying a backpack , however , only a few studies investigated optimal weight when carrying a bag in different ways.
P	To investigate the optimal weight for carrying a handbag.
M	This study involved 13 healthy females , randomized into four carrying weight patterns [no load , bag weight of 5% body weight ( BW ) , 7% BW , and 10% BW] who were walking barefoot on the platform at preferable speed.
M	The center of pressure ( COP ) was collected by the platform.
M	Spinous processes of C7 , T1 , T12 , L1 , S2 and the right tragus were attached with markers.
M	The muscle activities of upper trapezius , erector spinae , and rectus abdominis muscles were measured.
M	All data including discomfort scale were recorded.
R	The spinal curvature was not affected from carrying a handbag.
R	However , the COP trend was toward the carrying side when carrying a greater load.
R	Asymmetrical activities of the upper trapezius and erector spinae were shown ( p < 0.05 ).
R	The discomfort areas were the right upper trapezius and right finger flexor muscles.
C	Continuously carrying a handbag greater than 10% BW can cause musculoskeletal problems.
B	Over 100 ,000 women worldwide have been sterilized by insertion of quinacrine into the uterus to induce tubal scarring.
B	Concern has been expressed about possible carcinogenicity , and specifically the risk of uterine cancer.
M	From 2001 through 2006 , we conducted a population-based , case-control study of gynecologic cancers in 12 provinces in northern Vietnam , where relatively large numbers of women had received quinacrine.
M	Cases of incident cervical , ovarian , and uterine cancer were identified at provincial hospitals or at referral hospitals in Hanoi.
M	For each case , 3 age- and residence-matched controls were randomly selected from the population registries of the case's home community.
R	The prevalence of quinacrine exposure was 1.2% among cases and 1.1% among controls.
R	For cervical cancer , analysis of 606 cases ( 9 exposed ) and their 1774 matched controls ( 18 exposed ) produced an odds ratio of 1.44 ( 95% confidence interval = 0.59-3.48 ) (  adjusted for several covariates including human papillomavirus risk score ).
R	For ovarian cancer , based on 262 cases ( 3 exposed ) and 755 controls ( 8 exposed ) and adjusted for age and number of years of ovulation , the odds ratio was 1.26 ( 0.21-5.45 ).
R	For uterine cancer , none of the cases-including 23 cases of leiomyosarcoma- was exposed to quinacrine.
R	The 95% confidence interval , based on 161 cases ( none exposed ) and 470 controls ( 7 exposed ) and adjusted only for age , was 0-1.85.
C	We found no evidence of a relationship between quinacrine sterilization and gynecologic cancer.
B	Emotions may be important in patients' decisions to seek medical help for symptoms suggestive of cancer.
P	The aim of this systematic literature review was to examine quantitative literature on the influence of emotion on patients' help-seeking for symptoms suggestive of cancer.
P	The objectives were to identify the following: ( a ) which types of emotions influence help-seeking behaviour , ( b ) whether these form a barrier or trigger for seeking medical help and ( c ) how the role of emotions varies between different cancers and populations.
M	We searched four electronic databases and conducted a narrative synthesis.
M	Inclusion criteria were studies that reported primary , quantitative research that examined any emotion specific to symptom appraisal or help-seeking for symptoms suggestive of cancer.
R	Thirty-three papers were included.
R	The studies were heterogeneous in their methods and quality , and very few had emotion as the main focus of the research.
R	Studies reported a limited range of emotions , mainly related to fear and worry.
R	The impact of emotions appears mixed , sometimes acting as a barrier to consultation whilst at other times being a trigger or being unrelated to time to presentation.
R	It is plausible that different emotions play different roles at different times prior to presentation.
C	This systematic review provides some quantitative evidence for the role of emotions in help-seeking behaviour.
C	However , it also highlighted widespread methodological , definition and design issues among the existing literature.
C	The conflicting results around the role of emotions on time to presentation may be due to the lack of definition of each specific emotion.

B	The majority of the family caregivers are adult children in China.
B	The aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of reciprocal filial piety ( RFP ) between the care recipient's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia ( BPSD ) and the caregiver's burden or gain among adult-child caregivers caring for parents with dementia in China.
M	Using Kramer's caregiver adaptation model as the research framework , a cross-sectional survey collected data from 401 adult-child caregivers caring for parents with dementia from hospitals in China.
R	Results of the regression analysis revealed that after adjusting for covariates , the regression coefficient between care recipient's BPSD and caregiver burden reduced from c = 1.01 to c = 0.91 when controlling for RFP.
R	Using the bootstrap approach , the estimated indirect effect through RFP between care recipient's BPSD and caregiver burden was 0.11 ( 95% CI: 0.03 , 0.20 ).
R	The mediation proportion was 11%.
R	The absolute value of the regression coefficient between care recipient's BPSD and caregiver gain reduced from c = -0.75 to c = -0.63 when controlling for RFP.
R	The bootstrapped estimate of the indirect effect through RFP between care recipient's BPSD and caregiver gain was -0.12 ( 95% CI: -0.18 , -0.07 ).
R	The mediation proportion was 12%.
C	The findings suggest that the effect of care recipient's BPSD on caregiver's burden/gain may be related to the level of RFP among adult-child caregivers in China.
P	Repeated participation in fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) is one of the major factors affecting the long-term success of population-based colorectal cancer screening programs.
P	The aim of this study is to explore strong factors linked to repeated participation in FOBT in the prior decade ( 2002-2011 ) among adults using the Health Belief Model ( HBM ) after controlling for other covariates.
M	Data were obtained from South Korean adults , aged 50 years and over , who visited a national health screening center within a magnet hospital ( N = 237 ).
M	A pilot test was conducted to investigate the internal consistency of the HBM instruments and the clarity of survey questions.
M	Sample characteristics and rates of adherence to FOBT screening were examined using means and frequencies.
M	Important factors associated with adherence to FOBT were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
R	About 44% of the respondents were adherent to FOBT screening over the prior decade.
R	Four out of the six HBM-driven factors ( perceived susceptibility , severity , and barriers , and health motivation ) were statistically significant.
R	Those with greater levels of susceptibility and health motivation and lower levels of severity and barriers were more likely to adhere to FOBT.
C	Health professionals should focus more on the four modifiable HBM-related factors to encourage adults to adhere to FOBT.
C	Intervention programs , which lower perceived severity and barriers and increase susceptibility and health motivation , should be developed and implemented.

B	As Norway moves toward the provision of home-based crisis response , knowledge is needed about understandings of mental health crisis and effective ways of addressing crises within the home.
P	To elicit and learn from service users' experiences about the subjective meanings of crisis and what kind of help will be most effective in resolving mental health crises.
P	Theoretical: A phenomenological-hermeneutic cooperative inquiry method was used to elicit and analyse focus group responses from mental health service users who had experienced crises.
R	Findings clustered into three themes: ( 1 ) Crisis as multifaceted and varied experiences ; ( 2 ) losing the skills and structure of everyday life ; and ( 3 ) complexities involved in family support.
C	Several aspects of crises require an expansion of the biomedical model of acute intervention to include consideration of the personal and familial meaning of the crisis , attention to the home context , and activities of daily living that are disrupted by the crisis , and ways for the person and the family to share in and learn from resolution of the crisis.
B	China has implemented numerous pilots to shift its hospital payment mechanism from the traditional retrospective cost-based system to prospective diagnosis-related-group ( DRG ) -based system.
B	This study investigated the impact of the DRG payment reform with global budget in Zhongshan , China.
M	A total of 2895 patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) were selected from local two largest tertiary hospitals , among which 727 were discharged prior to the payment reform and 2168 afterwards.
M	Difference-in-difference ( DID ) regression models were used to evaluate the policy effects on patients' percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) use , hospital expenditures , in-hospital mortality , and readmission rates within 30 days after discharge.
R	Patients' PCI use and hospital expenditures increased quickly after the payment reform.
R	With patients with no local insurance scheme as reference , PCI use for local insured patients decreased significantly by 4.55 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.23 , 0.72 ) , meanwhile the total hospital expenses decreased significantly by US$986.10 ( b =-0.15 , P=0.0037 ) after reform.
R	No changes were observed with patients' hospital mortality and readmission rates in our study.
C	The innovative DRG-based payment reform in Zhongshan suggested a positive effect on AMI patient's cost containment but negative effect on encouraging resource use.
C	It had no impacts on patients' care quality.
C	Cost shifting consequence from the insured to the uninsured was observed.
C	More evidence of the impacts of the DRG-based payment in China's health scenario is needed before it is generalized nationwide.
B	Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) causes a costly and potentially recurrent bacterial infection that accounts for a considerable proportion of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) in the United States.
B	Disparities by gender and age group in CT prevalence have been reported previously.
B	The current study evaluates demographic , socioeconomic , and behavioral risk and protective factors that may account for gender/age disparities in CT infections among sexually active young adults in the United States.
M	Secondary analyses were performing using the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data.
R	A total sample of 5611 adults , 20-39 years of age , who participated in the 1999-2006 NHANES , reported lifetime sexual experience , and had valid laboratory-based CT status , was analyzed.
R	CT prevalence did not differ significantly by gender and was estimated to be 1.6%.
R	It was slightly higher for people <25 years vs. those >= 25 years of age ; age disparities were reduced after controlling for demographic , socioeconomic , and behavioral characteristics.
R	Among those <25 years , non-Hispanic blacks had a higher odds of CT infection compared with other groups.
R	Among those >= 25 years of age , not having had unprotected sex in the past month reduced the odds for CT infection , whereas non-Hispanic black race and never married status increased the odds for CT infection.
C	Among sexually active adults , no gender disparities were observed in CT prevalence.
C	Age group disparities were partly explained by personal characteristics associated with risk of STIs.
P	To describe how fatigue is experienced by stroke survivors , how they understand and deal with fatigue and how fatigue impacts their daily life.
M	A qualitative interview study was carried out as part of a larger longitudinal study investigating the prevalence , characteristics and contributing factors to post-stroke fatigue.
M	Thirty-two participants ( 15 men and 17 women ) were strategically sampled to explore the experiences of fatigue.
M	Participants were interviewed at 6 months , 1 year and 2 years post-stroke.
M	Data were analysed applying a Grounded theory approach.
R	Patients clearly described and differentiated their experience between: ( 1 ) tiredness as an ordinary life event and ( 2 ) fatigue as a post-stroke life condition.
R	Three fatigue-transforming strategies were identified , being on a mission , settling for less and stalling.
R	Stalling seemed to put the stroke survivors in a particularly vulnerable situation.
R	Over time , some participants moved between these two tiredness/fatigue manifestations and their range of strategies.
C	Post-stroke fatigue is a new life experience different from ordinary tiredness and seems to be a significant problem in the stroke survivors' struggle to regain a new normalcy.
C	Intervention studies are needed to reduce the impact of post-stroke fatigue on coping and recovery.
B	Research has not adequately examined the potential negative effects of perceiving routine discrimination on general healthcare utilization or health status , especially among reproductive-aged women.
B	We sought to evaluate the association between everyday discrimination , health service use , and perceived health among a national sample of women in the United States.
M	Data were drawn from the Women's Healthcare Experiences and Preferences survey , a randomly selected , national probability sample of 1078 U.S. women aged 18-55 years.
M	We examined associations between everyday discrimination ( via a standardized scale ) on frequency of health service utilization and perceived general health status using chi-square and multivariable logistic regression modeling.
R	Compared with women who reported healthcare visits every 3 years or less ( reference group ) , each one-point increase in discrimination score was associated with higher odds of having healthcare visits annually or more often ( odds ratio [OR]=1.36 , confidence interval [95% CI]=1.01-1.83 ).
R	Additionally , each one-point increase in discrimination score was significantly associated with lower odds of having excellent/very good perceived health ( OR=0.65 ; 95% CI=0.54-0.80 ).
C	Perceived discrimination was associated with increased exposure to the healthcare setting among this national sample of women.
C	Perceived discrimination was also inversely associated with excellent/very good perceived health status.
P	To estimate the prevalence of arterial hypertension and obesity and the population attributable fraction of hypertension that is due to obesity in Brazilian adolescents.
M	Data from participants in the Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents ( ERICA ) , which was the first national school-based , cross-section study performed in Brazil were evaluated.
M	The sample was divided into 32 geographical strata and clusters from 32 schools and classes , with regional and national representation.
M	Obesity was classified using the body mass index according to age and sex.
M	Arterial hypertension was defined when the average systolic or diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to the 95th percentile of the reference curve.
M	Prevalences and 95% confidence intervals ( 95% CI ) of arterial hypertension and obesity , both on a national basis and in the macro-regions of Brazil , were estimated by sex and age group , as were the fractions of hypertension attributable to obesity in the population.
R	We evaluated 73 ,399 students , 55.4% female , with an average age of 14.7 years ( SD = 1.6 ).
R	The prevalence of hypertension was 9.6% ( 95% CI 9.0-10.3 ) ; with the lowest being in the North , 8.4% ( 95% CI 7.7-9.2 ) and Northeast regions , 8.4% ( 95% CI 7.6-9.2 ) , and the highest being in the South , 12.5% ( 95% CI 11.0-14.2 ).
R	The prevalence of obesity was 8.4% ( 95% CI 7.9-8.9 ) , which was lower in the North region and higher in the South region.
R	The prevalences of arterial hypertension and obesity were higher in males.
R	Obese adolescents presented a higher prevalence of hypertension , 28.4% ( 95% CI 25.5-31.2 ) , than overweight adolescents , 15.4% ( 95% CI 17.0-13.8 ) , or eutrophic adolescents , 6.3% ( 95% CI 5.6-7.0 ).
R	The fraction of hypertension attributable to obesity was 17.8%.
C	ERICA was the first nationally representative Brazilian study providing prevalence estimates of hypertension in adolescents.
C	Regional and sex differences were observed.
C	The study indicates that the control of obesity would lower the prevalence of hypertension among Brazilian adolescents by 1/5.
B	The US Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) extended the age of eligibility for young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance plans in order to address the disproportionate number of uninsured young adults in the United States.
B	Effective September 23 , 2010 , the ACA has required all private health insurance plans to cover dependents until the age of 26.
B	However , it is unknown whether the ACA dependent coverage expansion had an impact on prescription drug insurance or the use of prescription drugs.
P	To evaluate short-term changes in prescription health insurance coverage , prescription drug insurance coverage , prescription drug use , and prescription drug expenditures following implementation of the ACA young adult insurance expansion using national data from 2009 and 2011.
R	Full-year health insurance coverage increased 4.9 percentage points during the study period , which was mainly due to increases in private health insurance among middle- and high-income young adults.
R	In contrast , full-year prescription drug insurance coverage increased 5.5 percentage points and was primarily concentrated among high-income young adults.
R	Although no significant short-term changes in overall prescription drug use were observed , a 30% decrease in out-of-pocket expenditures was seen among young adults.
C	While the main goal of the ACA's young adult insurance expansion was to increase health insurance coverage among young adults , it also had the unintended positive effect of increasing coverage for prescription drug insurance.
C	Additionally , young adults experienced substantial decreases in out-ofpocket spending for prescription drugs.
C	It is important for evaluations of health care policies to assess both intended and unintended outcomes to better understand the implications for the broader health system.

B	Access to physicians is a major concern for Medicaid programs.
B	However , little is known about relationships between physician participation in Medicaid and the individual-level and practice-level characteristics of physicians.
M	We used the 2011 Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database , containing all commercial and Medicaid claims ; we linked with data on physician characteristics.
M	We measured Medicaid participation intensity ( fraction of the physician's patient panel with Medicaid ) for primary care physicians ( PCPs ) and medical specialists.
M	We measured influence of physicians within a patient referral network using eigenvector centrality.
M	We used regression models to associate Medicaid intensity with physician individual-level and practice-level characteristics.
R	About 92.6% of physicians treated at least 1 Medicaid patient , but the median physician's panel contained only 5.7% Medicaid patients.
R	Medicaid intensity was associated with physician training and influence for PCPs and specialists.
R	For medical specialists , a 1 percentage point increase in Medicaid intensity was associated with a lower probability of being board certified ( -0.22 percentage points ; 95% CI , -0.30 , -0.14 ) , lower probability of attending a domestic medical school ( -0.14 percentage points ; 95% CI , -0.22 , -0.05 ) , having attended a less well-ranked domestic medical school ( 0.23 ranks ; 95% CI , 0.15 , 0.30 ) , and having slightly less influence in the referral network.
R	PCPs displayed similar results but high Medicaid intensity physicians had substantially less influence in the referral network.
C	Medicaid participation intensity shows substantial variation across physicians , indicating limits of binary participation measures.
C	Physicians with more Medicaid patients had characteristics often perceived by patients to be of lower quality.
B	Patients with panic disorder ( PD ) are known to report impaired sleep quality and symptoms of insomnia.
B	PD is an anxiety disorder characterised by deficient physiological regulation as measured by heart rate variability ( HRV ) , and reduced HRV , PD and insomnia have all been related to impaired inhibitory ability.
B	The present study aimed to investigate the interrelationships between subjectively reported sleep impairment , cognitive inhibition and vagally mediated HRV in a sample characterised by variability on measures of all these constructs.
M	Thirty-six patients with PD with or without agoraphobia were included.
M	Cognitive inhibition was assessed with the Color-Word Interference Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ) , HRV was measured using high frequency ( HF ) power ( ms( 2 ) ) , and subjectively reported sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ).
R	Cognitive inhibition was related to both Sleep latency and Sleep disturbances , whereas HRV was only related to Sleep disturbances.
R	These relationships were significant also after controlling for depression.
C	Correlational design.
C	Cognitive inhibition is related to key insomnia symptoms: sleep initiation and sleep maintenance.
C	The data supports the psychobiological inhibition model of insomnia , and extends previous findings.
C	Possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

B	The Swedish Parachute Association ( SFF ) national registry of skydiving injuries is one of the few trauma databases available for research on sport parachuting.
B	The usefulness of this compulsory reporting system may benefit from a description of its base population and an evaluation of its sensitivity and specificity.
M	Cross-sectional analysis based on data collected through a web-based questionnaire ( SKYNET ) , from all persons renewing a Swedish skydiving license 2008 ( n = 1049 ).
M	Sensitivity was measured as the proportion of injury events fulfilling the reporting criterion ( injury event requiring care of a physician ) that were actually reported , by comparing the injury events reported to the SFF during the skydiving seasons 2006 and 2007 with the injury events retrospectively reported to the web-based questionnaire for the same time period.
M	Specificity was measured as the proportion of false positives in relation to the defined reporting criterion for the same time period.
M	Self-stated bone fractures , shoulder dislocations and cruciate ligament injuries were labeled as non-minor injuries.
M	Factors affecting the likelihood of reporting were evaluated using logistic regression.
R	The response rate was 100%.
R	The overall sensitivity of the reporting system 2006/2007 was 0.37 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.24-0.51 ).
R	With self-stated non-minor injuries as the target for reporting , the sensitivity was 0.67 ( 95% CI 0.43-0.85 ).
R	No significant effect on reporting was found for gender , age , license level , years in the sport , total number of jumps or club affiliation.
R	The specificity was 0.91 ( 95% CI 0.83-0.95 ).
R	Descriptive statistics of the Swedish skydiving population show several gender differences.
C	The low sensitivity will yield false low incidence calculations , but as there is no evidence for differential underreporting , risk comparisons related to the candidate predictor variables appear reasonably valid.
C	The false positive reporting warrants assortment of incoming data and a clarification of the reporting criteria.
C	Attitudes to reporting may be of value to study , to understand the drivers and constraints for achieving a more complete notification of skydiving injuries.

B	It is well-known that exposure to combat puts individuals at risk for developing adverse psychological problems , including posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , anxiety , and health-related behaviour problems and that the presence of combat-related injury increases the risk for psychopathology.
B	Little is known , however , about the consequences of combat among conscripted soldiers fighting against terrorism in their homeland.
P	The main aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of probable PTSD , severity of PTSD symptoms , depression , anxiety , and PTSD-related functional impairment among Turkish combat-injured , nonprofessional veterans.
P	In addition , investigated were also the possible differences among the symptoms of PTSD , depression , and anxiety of the veterans by the frequency of current cigarette and alcohol use.
M	A total of 366 male veterans were assessed by using a demographic information form , which obtained information about injury status and health behaviours , the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale ( PDS ) , and the Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ).
M	Symptom frequency and multivariate analysis of variances ( MANOVA ) were used to analyse the data.
R	The prevalence of probable PTSD was 46.7% ( 171 ) among Turkish veterans while 16.4% experienced severe depression and 18% experienced severe anxiety.
R	"Upset at reminders ( 65.8% )'' was the most common PTSD symptom.
R	"Responsibilities related to home ( 48.4% )'' was the most frequently reported PTSD-related functional impairment.
R	Results indicated that veterans who smoke more than half a pack per day scored significantly higher in severity of PTSD symptoms , depression , and anxiety.
R	Contrary to expectations , there was no significant difference in symptoms of PTSD , depression , and anxiety related to the frequency of current alcohol use.
C	Turkish non-professional veterans with physical injuries have serious psychiatric problems an average of 13 years after a combat experience.
C	Psychiatric and psychosocial services to Turkish non-professional veterans are a substantial and ongoing need.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of laughter therapy on postpartum fatigue and stress responses of postpartum women.
M	The research design was a nonequivalent control group non-synchronized design.
M	The participants were 67 postpartum women who agreed to participate in this study , selected by convenience sampling: ( experiment group-33 and control group-34 ).
M	The data were collected from August 5 to September 30 , 2010.
M	The experimental group received laughter therapy from a laughter therapy expert for 60 min , twice a week for 2 weeks , a total of 4 sessions.
M	To evaluate the effects of laughter therapy , postpartum fatigue by self-report questionnaire and cortisol concentration in breast milk were measured.
M	The data were analyzed using the SPSS WIN 13.0 Program.
R	The first hypothesis that "the degree of postpartum fatigue in the experimental group participating in laughter therapy would be lower than that of the control group" was accepted.
R	These findings indicate that laughter therapy has a positive effect on decreasing postpartum fatigue.
C	The finding provides evidence for use of complementary and alternative nursing in Sanhujori facilities and obstetric units to reduce postpartum women's fatigue.
B	Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) is common in patients attending health-care services and is associated with a range of health problems.
B	The majority of IPV perpetrators are men , and a substantial minority of men are victims , yet health-care professionals have little evidence or guidance on how to respond to male patients who perpetrate or experience violence in their intimate relationships.
M	We conducted a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of interventions for male perpetrators or victims of IPV in health settings.
M	Online databases , reference lists , Google Scholar , and gray literature were searched , and inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied.
M	Narrative synthesis methods were used due to the heterogeneity of study types and outcome measures.
R	Fourteen studies describing 10 interventions met our inclusion criteria: nine randomized controlled trials , four cohort studies , and one case-control study.
R	Interventions were predominantly therapeutic in nature and many were conducted in alcohol treatment settings.
C	Overall , the evidence for effectiveness of interventions in health-care settings was weak , although IPV interventions conducted concurrently with alcohol treatment show some promise.
C	More work is urgently needed in health-care services to determine what interventions might be effective , and in what settings , to improve the response to male perpetrators or victims of IPV.
P	The use of foul language becomes increasingly popular among youth , yet scientific research on this topic is grossly missing in the literature.
P	This longitudinal study examined the developmental change of foul language use and its relations to emotional competence , social competence , and moral competence over high school years.
M	Data were from a six-year longitudinal study between grade 7 and grade 12 with an annual assessment on 3 ,328 Hong Kong adolescents ( mean age = 12.59 +/- .74 years ).
M	Multiplegroup latent growth curve modeling based on six waves of longitudinal data were conducted.
R	Results showed that the use of foul language increased , but the increase rate slowed down over time ; males showed faster increase rate yet faster deceleration than did females.
R	In addition , changes in emotional competence , social competence , and moral competence negatively predicted the change in use of foul language across males and females , respectively.
C	Adolescents are vulnerable to increasing their use of foul language.
C	However , promoting emotional competence , social competence , and moral competence could be helpful to minimize the increasing trend of use of foul language.

P	Children's marking of verbal -s was examined by their dialect ( African American English [AAE] vs. Southern White English [SWE] ) and clinical status ( specific language impairment [SLI] vs. typically developing [TD] ) and as a function of 4 linguistic variables ( verb regularity , negation , expression of a habitual activity , and expression of historical present tense ).
M	The data were language samples from 57 six-year-olds who varied by their dialect and clinical status ( AAE: SLI = 14 , TD = 12 ; SWE: SLI = 12 , TD = 19 ).
R	The AAE groups produced lower rates of marking than did the SWE groups , and the SWE SLI group produced lower rates of marking than did the SWE TD group.
R	Although low numbers of verb contexts made it difficult to evaluate the linguistic variables , there was evidence of their influence , especially for verb regularity and negation.
R	The direction and magnitude of the effects were often ( but not always ) consistent with what has been described in the adult dialect literature.
C	Verbal -s can be used to help distinguish children with and without SLI in SWE but not in AAE.
C	Clinicians can apply these findings to other varieties of AAE and SWE and other dialects by considering rates of marking and the effects of linguistic variables on marking.
B	Subjects with autistic spectrum disorders ( ASD ) show persistent deficits in social interaction.
B	In order to explore the scope of their deficits , it is of great interest to compare the different interpersonal skills and executive functions of ASD subjects to those of children with typical development.
B	Assessing these skills usually involves a large variety of informants ( parents , teachers , other family members ) and of measures , with frequent discrepancies between direct performance measures and indirect measures ( third-party report ).
B	Different explanations of this mismatch between measures have been addressed in previous studies.
P	We wish to analyze whether there are differences between children with ASD and children with typical development on several direct performance measures of interpersonal and neurocognitive skills and one third-party report on real-life performance of interpersonal skills ; we also want to look at whether discrepancies appear between the two types of measurements in the two groups of participants.
M	A total of 68 Spanish children between the ages of 7 and 12 years participated ; 34 were children with ASD , and 34 showed typical development.
M	All participants were tested for recognition of emotions , solving interpersonal conflicts , and executive function.
R	Significant differences between the two groups were not found on most of the direct performance measures , but they did appear in the report by third parties , in favor of the group with typical development.
R	There was also a significant association between neurocognitive and social variables in the latter group.
C	There were intergroup differences and discrepancies between the direct performance and indirect measures in children with ASD , and these must be explained.
C	For this reason , future studies could seek to explain the cause of these discrepancies with a greater number of measures for each of the skills.
B	Previously , we compared the hyperthymic scores of residents in Sapporo , Koshigaya , and Oita ( which are located at latitudes of 43 degrees N , 36 degrees N , and 33 degrees N in Japan , respectively ) using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis , Pisa , Paris and San Diego-auto questionnaire version ( TEMPS-A ).
B	We found that residents who lived at lower latitudes had higher hyperthymic temperament scores ; however , the mechanism of the effect of latitude on hyperthymic temperament remained unclear.
B	The current study examined the mediators of the latitude effect in additional regions with different annual temperatures and amounts of ambient sunshine.
M	The Japanese archipelago stretches over 4000 km from north to south and has four large islands: Hokkaido , Honshu , Shikoku , and Kyushu.
M	In addition to the TEMPS-A previously reported data collected at Sapporo ( latitude 43 degrees N ) , Koshigaya ( 36 degrees N ) , and Oita ( 33 degrees N ) , we collected the TEMPS-A data of 189 and 106 residents from Takaoka ( 36 degrees N ) and Obihiro ( 42 degrees N ) , respectively.
M	Taken together , these five regions have different patterns ( i.e. , highs and lows ) of annual ambient total sunshine ( hours ) and mean temperature ( degrees C ).
M	The effect of latitude , sunshine , and temperature on affective temperaments was analyzed for five Japanese regions.
R	Multiple regression analyses revealed that latitude predicted significant variance in hyperthymic temperament.
R	Ambient temperature , but not sunshine , significantly affected hyperthymic temperament.
C	The light exposure that residents actually received was not measured.
C	The number of regions studied was limited.
C	The findings might not generalize to residents across Japan or other countries.
C	The present findings suggest that latitude affects hyperthymic temperament , and ambient temperature might mediate this effect.

B	At the time of incarceration , women have a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections ( STI ).
B	In the months after community release , women remain at high risk for new infections.
B	This study assessed the rates and predictors of incident chlamydia , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis in a sample of hazardously drinking women after incarceration.
M	Self-reported behavioral data were collected from 245 incarcerated women.
M	Vaginal swabs were collected at baseline , and 3- and 6-month time points and tested for chlamydia , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis.
M	Treatment was provided for all positive tests.
R	Participants' mean age was 34.1 years of age ; 175 ( 71.4% ) were Caucasian , 47 ( 19.2% ) were African American , 17 ( 6.9% ) were Hispanic , and 6 ( 2.4% ) were of other ethnic origins.
R	The STI incidence rate was estimated to be 30.5 ( 95% confidence interval , 21.3-43.5 ) new infections per 100 person-years.
R	Number of male sex partners reported during follow-up was a significant ( z = 2.16 ; p = .03 ) predictor of STI ; each additional male sex partner increased the estimated hazard of STI by 1.26.
C	Incarcerated women who are hazardous drinkers are at high risk for STI in the months after their return to the community.
C	In addition to testing and treatment during incarceration , post-release rescreening , education , partner treatment , and follow-up are recommended.

B	Benzodiazepines ( BZD ) should be limited in older adults.
B	This study aimed to determine the association between BZD use and the presence of a probable post-traumatic stress syndrome ( PTSS ) and whether this association is dependent on gender and co-morbid physical and mental conditions.
M	Data were retained from the Etude sur la Sante des Aines ( ESA ) - Services study ( 2011-2013 ) and included 1 ,453 older adults ( >= 65 years ) who completed a face to face at-home interview , who were covered under Quebec's public drug insurance plan , and had given permission to access their Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec ( RAMQ ) medical and pharmaceutical services data.
M	The presence of a PTSS was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised ( IES-R ).
M	The use of BZD and antidepressants in the year prior to interview was ascertained from data reported in the RAMQ drug registry.
M	The presence of depression and an anxiety disorder was assessed with the ESA-Questionnaire which was based on DSM-5 criteria.
M	The interaction between PTSS and gender , depression , anxiety , and multi-morbidity was also assessed.
R	The prevalence of PTSS and BZD use reached 4.5% and 31.2%.
R	Participants with PTSS were 1.9 ( 95% CI = 1.1-3.2 ) times more likely to use BZD.
R	The presence of depression had a negative impact on the association between BZD use and PTSS ( p = 0.04 ).
C	The use of BZD in older adults with PTSS is still prevalent today.
C	Differences in benzodiazepine prescribing practices for more complex co-morbid psychiatric cases needs to be further studied.
B	Despite the increased attention for assessing the effectiveness of implementation strategies , most implementation studies provide little or no information on its associated costs.
B	The focus of the current study was to provide a detailed report of the resource use and costs associated with implementation of a short stay programme for breast cancer surgery in four Dutch hospitals.
M	The analysis was performed alongside a multi-centre implementation study.
M	The process of identification , measurement and valuation of the implementation activities was based on recommendations for the design , analysis and reporting of health technology assessments.
M	A scoring form was developed to prospectively determine the implementation activities at professional and implementation expert level.
M	A time horizon of 5 years was used to calculate the implementation costs per patient.
R	Identified activities were consisted of development and execution of the implementation strategy during the implementation project.
R	Total implementation costs over the four hospitals were [SIC]83.293.
R	Mean implementation costs , calculated for 660 patients treated over a period of 5 years , were [SIC]25 per patient.
R	Subgroup analyses showed that the implementation costs ranged from [SIC]3.942 to [SIC]32.000 on hospital level.
R	From a local hospital perspective , overall implementation costs were [SIC]21 per patient , after exclusion of the costs made by the expert centre.
C	We provided a detailed case description of how implementation costs can be determined.
C	Notable differences in implementation costs between hospitals were observed.
B	A screening program provides a teachable moment for primary prevention such as encouraging smoking cessation.
B	However , little is known about the efficacy of smoking cessation intervention delivered to the general population through a community-based screening program.
M	A quasi-experimental untreated control design with pre-test and post-test was conducted with 42 subjects receiving advice from physician and nurses ( the PNA group ) , 39 receiving an informational leaflet ( the leaflet group ) , and 308 control subjects.
R	The overall rate of reaching the action stage was 25 % , 5.7 % , and 7.8 in the PNA group , the leaflet group , and the control group , respectively.
R	In approximately 45-60 % of all participants , the stage remained unchanged.
R	Such an association between the intervention groups and stage changes was statistically significant ( p = 0.02 ).
R	The PNA group was more likely to have the improvement of stage ( forward transition toward action stage ) than the control group [ adjusted odds ratio ( aOR ) = 2.27 ( 1.07-4.84 )].
R	Deterioration ( backward transition toward precontemplation ) in the PNA intervention group was 37 % lower than that in the control group [aOR = 0.63 ( 0.20-2.01 )].
C	This study demonstrated that smoking cessation advice from physician and nurse is conducive to smoking cessation , as shown by greater movement toward and less movement away from smoking cessation through a community-based integrated screening platform.
B	The prevention of dementia is a global priority but its etiology is poorly understood.
B	Early life cognitive ability has been linked to subsequent dementia risk but studies to date have been small and none has examined sex differences.
M	In the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey cohort , we related intelligence test scores at age 11 years in 16 ,370 boys and 16 ,097 girls ( born in 1921 ) to incident dementia ages >= 65 years as ascertained using probabilistic linkage to electronic health records up to the age of 92 years ( 1 ,231 cases in men , 2 ,163 in women ; median follow-up 15 years ).
R	Compared with the highest intelligence group ( IQ >= 115 ) , dementia risk was raised in the lowest-scoring category ( <85 ) and these associations were stronger for women ( hazard ratio ; 95% confidence interval: 1.51 ; 1.29 , 1.76 ) than men ( 1.19 ; 0.98 , 1.44 ; P value for interaction by gender: 0.054 ).
R	There was evidence of a doseresponse association between childhood IQ and dementia in women ( IQ 100-114.9 compared with >= 115: 1.18 ; 1.03 , 1.34 ; IQ 85-99.9: 1.32 ; 1.15 , 1.51 ; P value for trend <0.001 ) but not in men ( 1.05 ; 0.89 , 1.24 and 1.01 ; 0.85 , 1.21 ; 0.44 ).
C	Childhood intelligence is related to subsequent dementia risk but this association is not the same in men and women.
B	Association Splitting ( AS ) is a novel cognitive technique , which has shown some promise for the reduction of obsessive thoughts in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ).
B	Its effect on unwanted intrusive thoughts ( UITs ) in the general population is yet unknown.
M	Our experimental study tested the effect of AS in 49 participants who reported UITs as a regular problem.
M	Participants were randomly allocated either to an AS versus waitlist control ( WL ) condition.
M	The White Bear Suppression Inventory ( WBSI ) was used for measuring changes over time.
R	Significant group differences were found across time.
R	Relative to WL , AS exerted a positive effect on the reduction of UITs yielding a large effect size.
R	According to self-report AS exerted a positive effect 6 days after the participants had initiated the exercises.
R	All subjects in the AS condition judged the technique as effective
C	Results suggest that AS could be a suitable intervention to help people with a potential vulnerability to a clinical problem to control their UITs.
B	There is evidence that disgust propensity ( tendency to experience disgust ) and disgust sensitivity ( tendency to perceive disgust experiences as aversive ) play a role in the development and maintenance of hypochondriasis.
P	Is there a relationship between both disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity and hypochondriacal features , even after controlling for dispositional variables?
M	Forty-six female subjects filled in the following questionnaires: Whiteley-Index ( hypochondriasis ) , Scales for the Assessment of Disgust Propensity and Disgust Sensitivity , Anxiety-Sensitivity-Index , State-Trait-Anxiety-Depression-Inventory ( trait anxiety ).
R	There were positive relationships between both disgust sensitivity and disgust propensity and disease phobia.
R	Even after controlling for age , anxiety-sensitivity and trait anxiety both disgust domains could explain 12% additional variance of disease phobia.
C	The role of disgust for hypochondriacal features appears to be larger than expected so far.
B	Expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats is the molecular basis of Friedreich's ataxia ( FRDA ).
B	Precise detection of the GAA expansion repeat in frataxin gene has always been a challenge.
B	Different molecular methods have been suggested for detection of GAA expansion , including ; short-PCR , long-PCR , Triplet repeat primed-PCR ( TP-PCR ) and southern blotting.
B	The aim of study was to evaluate two PCR-based methods , TP-PCR and long-PCR , and to explore the use of TP-PCR accompanying with long-PCR for accurate genotyping of FRDA patients.
M	Blood samples were collected from six Iranian patients suspected to FRDA , who referred to the Department of Medical Genetics at Tehran University of Medical Sciences during the year 2014.
M	For one of these patients' four asymptomatic members of the family were also recruited for the analysis.
M	DNA extraction was performed by two different methods.
M	TP-PCR and long-PCR were carried out in all samples.
M	The type of this study is assessment / investigation of methods.
R	Using a combination of the above methods , the genotypes of all samples were confirmed as five homozygous mutants ( expanded GAA repeats ) , two heterozygous and three homozygous normal ( normal repeat size ).
R	The results obtained by TP-PCR are consistent with long-PCR results.
C	The presence or absence of expanded alleles can be identified correctly by TP-PCR.
C	Performing long-PCR and Fluorescent-long-PCR enables accurate genotyping in all samples.
C	This approach is highly reliable.
C	It could be successfully used for detection of GAA expansion repeats.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine effects of the Permission , Limited Information , Specific Suggestions , Intensive Therapy ( PLISSIT ) model sexual health enhancement program on , and development in , sexual function , sexual distress , marital intimacy , and subjective happiness of women with gynecologic cancer and their husbands.
M	The comprehensive program ( 4 session , 90 minutes per session ) was developed based on the PLISSIT model.
M	Participants were 43 couples , 21 assigned to the experimental group who attended the 4-week program , and 22 to the control group.
M	Sexual function , sexual distress , marital intimacy , subjective happiness of the women , marital intimacy , subjective happiness of husbands were determined by a questionnaire that was completed by the participants before and after the program.
M	The control group received the intervention post experiment.
M	Chi-square test , t-test , Fisher's exact test were used to test the effectiveness of the program.
R	Post intervention results showed significant differences between the groups for sexual function , sexual distress , and marital intimacy in the women and for subjective happiness in the husbands.
C	Results indicate that the sexual health enhancement program is effective in improving sexual function , lowering sexual distress , increasing marital intimacy , and subjective happiness in women with gynecologic cancer and their husbands.
B	Recent research on the patterns of self-harm around public holidays is lacking.
B	This study used national data to examine the patterns of hospital-treated self-harm during public holidays , and to examine associated factors.
M	Data on self-harm presentations to all emergency departments were obtained from the National Self Harm Registry Ireland.
M	The association between self-harm presentations and public holidays was examined using univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses.
R	A total of 104 ,371 presentations of self-harm were recorded between 2007 and 2015.
R	The mean number of self-harm presentations was 32 on public holidays.
R	St. Patrick's Day had the highest number of presentations compared to all other public holidays , with a daily mean of 44 presentations.
R	Across all years , self-harm presentations during public holidays had a 24% increased risk of involving alcohol consumption compared to all other days and this effect was most pronounced during the Christmas period.
R	The association with alcohol remained significant at a multivariate level.
R	Presentations on public holidays were more likely to attend out of normal working hours.
R	An increase in male presentations involving self-cutting was observed on public holidays and there was an over-representation of males presenting for the first time.
C	It is likely that extent of alcohol involvement in self-harm presentations reported here is an underestimate , as it was dependent on the information being recorded by the attending clinician.
C	Public holidays are associated with an elevated number of self-harm presentations to hospital , with presentations to hospital involving alcohol significantly increased on these days.
C	Hospital resources should be targeted to address increases during public holidays , including during out-of-hours.
C	Involvement of alcohol may delay delivery of care to these patients in emergency settings.
B	Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) is presently one of the most popular surgical procedures for obesity.
B	One of the possible long-term problems is weight regain , usually after a period of successful weight loss.
B	Weight regain after LSG can be due to new eating habits , such as sweet eating or eating snacks , or volume eating because of impaired restriction.
B	This study was done to determine the potential benefit of placing a band of double layer mesh ( Gortex mesh ) around the upper portion of a sleeved stomach to prevent late dilatation and weight gain.
M	From June 2011 to July 2012 , 24 patients underwent a LSG followed by placement of a band of double layer mesh ( Gortex mesh ) 6 cm from the gastro-esophageal junction.
M	The results were compared with 24 patients undergoing non-banded sleeve gastrectomy ( NBSG ) during the same period.
M	Outcome measures included postoperative morbidity and mortality , and weight loss in terms of initial body mass index , percentage weight loss through the following 12-18 months ( from July 2012 to January 2014 ) , weight loss maintenance , and weight regain.
R	All 48 patients showed weight loss , with improvement or resolution of their diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and sleep apnea after banded sleeve gastrectomy ( BSG ) similar to the NBSG group.
R	However , the curve of weight loss was steeper in the group of BSG , and weight loss maintenance was remarkable in this group compared with the NBSG group.
R	There were no deaths in either group.
C	BSG provides better results in the curve of losing weight and weight loss maintenance.
C	While this study documents the feasibility and possible benefits of this modification , other prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to establish its role in surgical weight loss procedures.
B	Nursing competence is of significant importance for patient care.
B	Newly graduated nursing students rate their competence as high.
B	However , the impact of different designs of nursing curricula on nursing students' self-reported nursing competence areas is seldom reported.
P	To compare newly graduated nursing students' self-reported professional competence before and after the implementation of a new nursing curriculum.
P	The study had a descriptive comparative design.
P	Nursing students , who graduated in 2011 , having studied according to an older curriculum , were compared with those who graduated in 2014 , after a new nursing curriculum with more focus on person-centered nursing had been implemented.
M	A higher education nursing program at a Swedish university.
M	In total , 119 ( 2011 n = 69 , 2014 n = 50 ) nursing students responded.
M	Nursing students' self-reported professional competencies were assessed with the Nurse Professional Competence ( NPC ) scale.
R	There were no significant differences between the two groups of nursing students , who graduated in 2011 and 2014 , respectively , with regard to age , sex , education , or work experience.
R	Both groups rated their competencies as very high.
R	Competence in value-based nursing was perceived to be significantly higher after the change in curriculum.
R	The lowest competence , both in 2011 and 2014 , was reported in education and supervision of staff and students.
C	Our findings indicate that newly graduated nursing students- both those following the old curriculum and the first batch of students following the new one - perceive that their professional competence is high.
C	Competence in value-based nursing , measured with the NPC scale , was reported higher after the implementation of a new curriculum , reflecting curriculum changes with more focus on person-centered nursing.

B	Too little is currently known about the prevalence of and risk factors for depression and carer strain among informal carets of community-dwelling elderly mentally ill.
B	This study seeks to assess the prevalence of depression , using the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 ( GDS-15 ) , the degree of carer burden/strain , and their risk factors among the primary informal carets of patients referred to our community-based old age psychiatry service.
M	A cross-sectional study design was used , with the subjects comprising 100 primary informal caters of patients who live at home and were referred to our service.
M	The main carer measures were the GDS-15 and an adapted version of Gilleard's Strain Scale.
M	Patients were assessed the Clifton Assessment Procedure for the Elderly-Survey version , the GDS-15 and the Mini-mental State Examination.
R	Depression was found in 21% of the carers ( a score of 5 or more on the GDS-15 ).
R	The more problem behaviors identified and the greater the functional impairment of the patient , the higher the strain score deciles and the more likely the carer was to be depressed.
R	Spouses were associated with lower carer strain scores.
R	Patient diagnoses did not affect carer depression or carer strain.
C	We found high levels of depression in the primary carets of community-dwelling patients attending an old age psychiatric service.
C	The patients' behavior and their cognitive and functional ability conferred greater risk of carer depression or strain than their diagnosis.
C	These risk factors may help identify carets at risk of strain and depression.
P	Complexity-based approaches to treatment have been gaining popularity in domains such as phonology and aphasia but have not yet been tested in child morphological acquisition.
P	In this study , we examined whether beginning treatment with easier-to-inflect ( easy first ) or harder-to-inflect ( hard first ) verbs led to greater progress in the production of regular past-tense -ed by children with developmental language disorder.
M	Eighteen children with developmental language disorder ( ages 4-10 ) participated in a randomized controlled trial ( easy first , N = 10 , hard first , N = 8 ).
M	Verbs were selected on the basis of frequency , phonological complexity , and telicity ( i.e. , the completedness of the event ).
M	Progress was measured by the duration of therapy , number of verb lists trained to criterion , and pre/post gains in accuracy for trained and untrained verbs on structured probes.
R	The hard-first group made greater gains in accuracy on both trained and untrained verbs but did not have fewer therapy visits or train to criterion on more verb lists than the easy-first group.
R	Treatment fidelity , average recasts per session , and verbs learned did not differ across conditions.
C	When targeting grammatical morphemes , it may be most efficient for clinicians to select harder rather than easier exemplars of the target.
B	Multiple meta-analyses of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) studies have reported impaired white matter integrity in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ).
B	However , owing to inclusion of medicated patients in these studies , it is difficult to conclude whether these reported alterations are associated with MDD or confounded by medication effects.
B	A meta-analysis of DTI studies on medication-free ( medication-naive and medication washout ) patients with MDD would therefore be necessary to disentangle MDD-specific effects.
M	We analyzed white matter alterations between medication-free patients with MDD and healthy controls using anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping ( AES-SDM ).
M	We used DTI query software for fibre tracking.
R	Both pooled and subgroup meta-analyses in medication washout patients showed robust fractional anisotropy ( FA ) reductions in white matter of the right cerebellum hemispheric lobule , body of the corpus callosum ( CC ) and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus III ( SLF III ) , whereas FA reductions in the genu of the CC and right anterior thalamic projections were seen in only medication-naive patients.
R	Fibre tracking showed that the main tracts with observed FA reductions included the right cerebellar tracts , body of the CC , bilateral SLF III and arcuate fascicle.
C	The analytic techniques , patient characteristics and clinical variables of the included studies were heterogeneous ; we could not exclude the effects of nondrug therapies owing to a lack of data.
C	By excluding the confounding influences of current medication status , findings from the present study may provide a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology of MDD.
B	Incidence rates of haematological malignancies increase with age.
B	In these older cancer patients , important information may be missed without a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ).
B	A validated screening instrument is needed to identify those patients for whom a CGA would be beneficial.
B	The G8 has recently been validated as a screening tool for older cancer patients in need of a CGA.
P	To test the performance of the G8 screening tool in older patients with aggressive haematological malignancies to identify those who would benefit from a CGA.
M	Cross-sectional study of patients >= 70 years with a recently diagnosed haematological malignancy.
M	G8 , CGA ( including six questionnaires ) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics ( CIRS-G ) were completed in each patient.
M	The CGA was considered abnormal when at least one questionnaire showed an impaired score.
R	Fifty patients with median age of 76 years were included ; 88% ( N = 44 ) had an abnormal CGA.
R	ROC curve analyses revealed a G8 score <= 14 obtained a sensitivity of 89% ( 95% CI 75-96 ) and a specificity of 100% ( 95% CI 54-100 ) , suggesting an optimal cut-off point.
R	AUC SE was 0.949 +/- 0.030.
R	Inclusion of comorbidity in the CGA did not change the performance of the G8 ( 0.943 +/- 0.034 ; P = 0.895 ).
C	The G8 can be used as a valid screening tool in older patients with aggressive haematological malignancies to identify those patients who would benefit from a CGA.
C	Comorbidity should be assessed routinely and independently of the G8.

B	Child Health research is reported to be at worryingly low level by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
B	Recent survey showed that 54.5% of paediatric consultants in the United Kingdom do not do any research at all.
B	We conducted a mixed methods study to understand barriers and facilitators for research involvement among paediatric trainees who are going to fill these consultant posts in the future.
M	A questionnaire based on a validated index for research and development was completed by 136 paediatric trainees within a region in the North of England ( Yorkshire and Humber ).
M	Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with stratified purposive sampling.
M	Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test for independence were used for quantitative analysis.
M	Thematic content analysis was done for interviews based on analysis method framework.
R	136 out of 396 trainees responded to the survey.
R	There was a significant relationship between confidence in using research in practice and ability to understand research terminology.
R	This was not related to research experience or training.
R	Males were significantly more likely to have presented a research paper , know how research influences practice and have more confidence in using research in practice than females.
R	There was no significant relationship between gender and research training or highest qualification.
R	Time constraints and lack of academic culture were the most frequently mentioned barriers in the survey.
R	Over-arching themes identified from the interviews were related to lack of academic culture , opportunities provided in current training scheme and constraints related to time availability along with workforce management.
C	Paediatric research requires a supportive academic culture with more flexibility in training scheme and immediate attention to a pressing staffing crisis.
B	Although process of care is a valuable dimension of quality , process-of-care-based quality indicators ( POC-QIs ) are ideally associated with meaningful patient outcomes.
B	The relationship between POC-QIs for hospitalized older patients and functional decline , a relevant outcome for older patients , is unknown.
P	To assess the relationship between POC-QIs for hospitalized elders and functional decline.
M	Observational cohort study.
M	Hospitalized vulnerable elder patients age 65 or older admitted to a general medicine inpatient service from June 1 , 2004 to June 1 , 2007.
M	POC-QIs received by hospitalized patients ( measured by Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders QIs ) and functional decline ( increased activities of daily living impairments postdischarge ).
R	For 898 vulnerable elder patients , mean adherence to 6 universally applied quality indicators was 57.8%.
R	After adjustment for factors likely associated with functional decline ( comorbidity , vulnerability , baseline functional limitation , number of POC-QIs triggered , length of stay , code status , and interaction between frailty and QI adherence ) , there was no association higher quality of care ( using the composite score ) and increased risk of functional decline.
R	Patients who received a mobility plan were 1.48 ( 95% Cl: 1.07-2.05 ; P = 0.017 ) times more likely to suffer functional decline after discharge.
R	Patients who received an assessment Of nutritional status had a lower odds of suffering functional decline after discharge ( OR: 0.37 , [95% Cl: 0.21-0.64 ; P < 0.001] ).
C	Hospitalized vulnerable elders who receive higher quality of care , as measured by Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders QIs , are not less likely to suffer decline after discharge.
B	We aimed to investigate factors enabling older people with cognitive impairment to age successfully.
M	We used the 12-item Short Form Health Survey to measure health-related quality of life ( HR-QoL ) in 2 ,007 people aged >= 60 in the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey.
M	We tested the hypothesis that affective symptoms and social support mediated the relationship between cognitive functioning and poorer HR-QoL.
R	The mean age of the participants was 66.2 ( 66.0-66.4 ).
R	The majority of people with suspected dementia reported high mental health-related quality of life , suggesting they may not be distressed by , or aware of , cognitive and mental impairment , and the majority are aging "successfully."
R	The relationship between cognitive impairment and mental HR-QoL was mediated by affective symptoms , but not by social support.
R	After considering mediators and confounders , HR-QoL was no longer associated with cognitive impairment.
C	The lower quality of life previously reported by people with cognitive impairment is due to the greater physical and mental health problems in this population , rather than to cognitive impairment per se.
C	Active management of mental and physical health may improve the HR-QoL of those with cognitive impairment who are not ageing successfully.
B	The study attempted to explore the quality of life ( QoL ) of Chinese caregivers with mentally ill relatives.
B	It also aimed to examine the differential roles of caregiving burdens , caregiver characteristics , and satisfaction with psychiatric services in caregivers' QoL.
M	276 caregivers with relatives attending community psychiatric facilities in Hong Kong were invited to fill out a questionnaire.
M	One sample t-tests were conducted to compare the results of this study with that of other Chinese populations in Hong Kong , Taiwan , and mainland China.
M	A hierarchical regression analysis was performed to examine the relative influence of different factors on caregivers' QoL.
R	Our sample of caregivers had significantly lower QoL scores than other Chinese populations.
R	Results also suggest that Chinese caregivers who had chronic illness , younger in age , a lower education level , experienced more difficulties in handling negative symptoms , and were more dissatisfied with mental health services had poorer quality of life.
R	Indeed , caregiver characteristics displayed a much stronger association with caregivers' QoL than did caregiving burdens and satisfaction with psychiatric services.
C	This study supports the strong association of caregiver characteristics and the QoL of caregivers and establishes the nature of the relationship between satisfaction with mental health services and caregiver QoL.
C	Implications for future research and practice are discussed.
P	To identify trajectories of smoking behaviors of a cohort of youth followed through young adulthood from 2000 to 2013.
M	The Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort study , a population-based cohort study.
M	Nationwide , originating in the Midwestern United States.
M	Cohort of youth surveyed for 14 years beginning at ages 12 to 16 ( N = 4241 at baseline ; 59% recruitment rate ).
M	Main variable of interest was the number of days smoked in the past 30 days.
M	Also included time-varying and time-invariant covariates.
M	We utilized growth mixture modeling to group individuals into trajectories over time.
R	We identified 5 distinct trajectories: nonsmokers ( 59.5% ) , early-onset regular smokers ( 14.2% ) , occasional smokers ( 11.5% ) , late-onset regular smokers ( 9.4% ) , and quitters ( 5.3% ).
R	Adjusted models showed that early- and late-onset regular smokers ( compared to nonsmokers ) had lower odds of attending or graduating from a 4-year college ( P < .05 ).
R	Participants in all smoking classes compared to nonsmokers had greater odds of having more close friends who smoked ( P < .05 ).
C	Our results show that individuals in their teens through young adulthood can be classified into 5 smoking trajectories.
C	More people in this age range remained abstainers than found in most previous studies ; however , a sizable group was identified as regular smokers by the time they reached young adulthood.
C	Interventions targeted at teens , including those that address social and environmental influences , are clearly still needed to prevent escalation of smoking as they move toward young adulthood.
B	Sexual coercion is associated with sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies with consequential unsafe abortions and increased maternal morbidity and mortality.
B	Current literature focuses mainly on its risk factors but less on its resultant deleterious health effects.
B	We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of sexual coercion and its association with unwanted pregnancies among young pregnant women.
M	In a cross-sectional study , four hundred and sixteen ( 416 ) consenting pregnant females aged 15-24 years attending antenatal clinics in Lubaga division Kampala district in Uganda were enrolled using systematic sampling.
M	Quantitative and qualitative data on sexual coercion were collected by female interviewers.
M	Adjusted Prevalence Proportion Ratios ( Adj. PPRs ) of unwanted pregnancy and associated 95 % confidence intervals were estimated by generalized linear models with log link function and Poisson family distribution using robust variance estimator.
M	Quantitative data were analyzed using Stata version 10.0 , while qualitative data were analyzed using manifest content analysis.
R	Prevalence of sexual coercion was 24 % and was higher among those who had non consensual sexual debut ( 29.0 % ) compared with those who had consensual sexual debut ( 22.6 % ).
R	The prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was 18.3 % and was higher among participants who had been sexually coerced relative to their counterparts ( p < 0.001 ).
R	History of sexual coercion in the past 12 months and non consensual sexual debut were associated with unwanted pregnancy [adj.PPR = 2.23 , 95 % CI: ( 1.49-3.32 )] and 1.72 , 95 % CI: ( 1.16-2.54 )] respectively.
R	Qualitative results indicated that different forms/contexts of sexual coercion , such as deception , transactional sex and physical force influenced unwanted pregnancies.
C	This study highlights that a quarter of our participants in our quantitative study had experienced sexual coercion in the past twelve months and nearly a third of these , had history of non consensual sexual debut.
C	Unwanted pregnancy was higher among the sexually coerced and those who had non consensual sexual debut.
C	Sexual coercion among pregnant women aged 15-24 years in Kampala , Uganda is high and is significantly associated with unwanted pregnancy.
C	Comprehensive sex education targeting young people ( < 25 years ) , along with availability and access to youth friendly centers may be useful in addressing sexual coercion and its negative outcomes.
B	In England over the last two decades , there has been a growing interest in the role of English schools in developing , facilitating and supporting young people's community participation.
B	A number of policy initiatives have sought to build the capacity and opportunities for youth participation.
B	Research suggests , however , that pupils and schools are often prohibited by significant barriers from becoming involved with community activities , particularly those that might occur beyond the school environment itself.
B	In March 2010 , the UK Labour government launched a Youth Community Action initiative for England , piloted across five local authorities , which aimed to involve young people of 14-16 years of age in community action.
B	Following the UK general election in May 2010 , the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government terminated these pilots but was quick to announce the launch and piloting of a National Citizen Service for 16-19-year-olds in England.
P	Drawing on research conducted with participants in one Youth Community Action pilot project , the aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and understandings of young people regarding their involvement in community action activities and how this compared with the perceptions and understandings of the teachers responsible for co-ordinating such activities.
M	In the final synthesis , the sample comprised 614 pupil questionnaires , representing a response rate of 24% of the pupils in the nine participating schools.
M	Eleven semi-structured interviews and one focus group interview were conducted with pupils in six of the schools , with a further eight semi-structured interviews conducted with teachers in these six schools.
M	A questionnaire was administered to pupils participating in the Youth Community Action pilot , enabling an exploration of self-reported behavioural attitudes and perceptions.
M	The data collected was analysed thematically , with an identification of common themes in responses.
M	In addition , factor analysis and a series of chi-squared tests of association were carried out.
M	The use of semi-structured interviews , the data from which were analysed thematically , enabled a qualitative exploration of pupils' and teachers' self-reported perceptions of community action activities.
R	The findings of our questionnaires report that those pupils who know more about their local neighbourhood and community are likely to report greater levels of concern for what happens within it.
R	This suggests that pupils' learning about their neighbourhoods and community is likely to be beneficial toward developing affective attachments to them.
R	For the pupils in our data set , simply possessing pro-social behaviours and attitudes was not a sufficient or necessary condition for their community awareness and involvement.
R	It suggests that , at least for a notable number of pupils , active engagement in the community requires cultivation and learning beyond pro-social behaviours.
R	The semi-structured interviews report that pupils identify the school as the key source of information about community engagement opportunities , but also indicate that there is a marked difference in the activities that teachers identify their pupils as having undertaken , and the ability of pupils to vocalise these themselves.
R	A further notable finding was a focus on the practical ( time , distance , age constraints ) and social ( peer pressure ) barriers to community action activities to the exclusion of specifically educational ( lack of understanding and skills ) barriers.
C	Results from this study suggest that schools represent an important source for pupils' community involvement , but that in our sample pupils often lack the vocabulary with which to explain the extent and nature of such engagement.
C	Pupils and teachers identify a range of barriers to and benefits of community involvement , but these do not include a lack of understanding or skills.
C	The research raises important questions in the context of recent policy trends in England.
B	National estimates on per capita alcohol consumption are provided regularly by various sources and may have validity problems , so corrections are needed for monitoring and assessment purposes.
B	Our objectives were to compare different alcohol availability estimates for Spain , to build the best estimate ( actual consumption ) , characterize its time trend during 2001-2011 , and quantify the extent to which other estimates ( coverage ) approximated actual consumption.
M	Estimates were: alcohol availability from the Spanish Tax Agency ( Tax Agency availability ) , World Health Organization ( WHO availability ) and other international agencies , self-reported purchases from the Spanish Food Consumption Panel , and self-reported consumption from population surveys.
M	Analyses included calculating: between-agency discrepancy in availability , multisource availability ( correcting Tax Agency availability by underestimation of wine and cider ) , actual consumption ( adjusting multisource availability by unrecorded alcohol consumption/purchases and alcohol losses ) , and coverage of selected estimates.
M	Sensitivity analyses were undertaken.
M	Time trends were characterized by joinpoint regression.
R	Between-agency discrepancy in alcohol availability remained high in 2011 , mainly because of wine and spirits , although some decrease was observed during the study period.
R	The actual consumption was 9.5 l of pure alcohol/person-year in 2011 , decreasing 2.3 % annually , mainly due to wine and spirits.
R	2011 coverage of WHO availability , Tax Agency availability , self-reported purchases , and self-reported consumption was 99.5 , 99.5 , 66.3 , and 28.0 % , respectively , generally with downward trends ( last three estimates , especially self-reported consumption ).
R	The multisource availability overestimated actual consumption by 12.3 % , mainly due to tourism imbalance.
C	Spanish estimates of per capita alcohol consumption show considerable weaknesses.
C	Using uncorrected estimates , especially self-reported consumption , for monitoring or other purposes is misleading.
C	To obtain conservative estimates of alcohol-attributable disease burden or heavy drinking prevalence , self-reported consumption should be shifted upwards by more than 85 % ( 91 % in 2011 ) of Tax Agency or WHO availability figures.
C	The weaknesses identified can probably also be found worldwide , thus much empirical work remains to be done to improve estimates of per capita alcohol consumption.
B	Although the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index has been endorsed as a gauge of the quality of the nursing practice environment by several organizations in the United States promoting healthcare quality , there is no literature describing its use in different practice settings and countries.
P	The purpose of this study was to inform research by describing the modifications and use of the scale in a variety of practice settings and countries.
M	The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the PubMed databases were searched for the years 2002-2010 to identify 37 research reports published since 2002 describing use , modification , and scoring variations in different practice settings and countries.
R	The scale was modified for 10 practice settings in five countries and translated into three languages.
R	Composite scores ranged from 2.48 to 3.17 ( on a 1-4 scale ).
R	The Staffing and Resource Adequacy subscale most often scored lowest.
R	A new Nursing Information Technology subscale has been developed.
R	New scoring methods to identify the favorability of practice environments are described.
R	Over time , the nature of the research conducted using the measure has changed.
R	Overall , most publications report significant associations between scale scores and multiple nurse , patient , and organizational outcomes.
C	Scale use is growing across different clinical settings and countries.
C	Recommendations for future research use include reducing scale length , using consistent scoring methods , considering the impact of various modifications on the basis of cultural and clinical setting nuances , and using the measure in longitudinal and intervention research designs.
B	Medicaid is the main public health insurance program for individuals with low income in the United States.
B	Some state Medicaid programs cover preventive eye care services and vision correction , while others cover emergency eye care only.
B	Similar to other optional benefits , states may add and drop adult vision benefits over time.
P	This article examines whether providing adult vision benefits is associated with an increase in the percentage of low-income individuals with appropriately corrected distance vision as measured during an eye exam.
M	We estimate the effect of Medicaid vision coverage on the likelihood of having appropriately corrected distance vision using examination data from the 2001-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
M	We compare vision outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries ( n = 712 ) and other low income adults not enrolled in Medicaid ( n = 4786 ) before and after changes to state vision coverage policies.
R	Between 29 and 33 states provided Medicaid adult vision benefits during 2001-2008 , depending on the year.
R	Our findings imply that Medicaid adult vision coverage is associated with a significant increase in the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries with appropriately corrected distance vision of up to 10 percentage points.
C	Providing vision coverage to adults on Medicaid significantly increases the likelihood of appropriate correction of distance vision.
C	Further research on the impact of vision coverage on related functional outcomes and the effects of Medicaid coverage of other services may be appropriate.

B	Tourette syndrome ( TS ) is characterized by dysfunctional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and sub-cortical structures , and altered meso-cortical and/or meso-striatal dopamine release.
B	Since time processing is also regulated by fronto-striatal circuits and modulated by dopaminergic transmission , we hypothesized that time processing is abnormal in TS.
M	We compared time processing abilities between nine children with TS-only ( i.e. without major psychiatric comorbidities ) and 10 age-matched healthy children , employing a time reproduction task in which subjects actively reproduce different temporal intervals , and a time comparison task in which subjects judge whether a test interval is longer or shorter than a reference interval.
M	IQ sustained and divided attention , and working memory were assessed in both groups using the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised , and the Digit Span sub-test of the WISC-R.
R	Children with TS-only reproduced in an overestimated fashion over-second , but not sub-second , time intervals.
R	The precision of over-second intervals reproduction correlated with tic severity , in that the lower the tic severity , the closer the reproduction of over-second time intervals to their real duration.
R	Time reproduction performance did not significantly correlate with IQ attention and working memory measures in both groups.
R	No differences between groups were documented in the time comparison task.
C	The improvement of time processing in children with TS-only seems specific for the over-second range of intervals , consistent with an enhancement in the 'cognitively controlled' timing system , which mainly processes longer duration intervals , and depends upon dysfunctional connectivity between the basal ganglia and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex.
C	The absence of between-group differences on time comparison , moreover , suggests that TS patients manifest a selective improvement of 'motor' timing abilities , rather than of perceptual time abilities.
C	Our data also support an enhancement of cognitive control processes in TS children , probably facilitated by effortful tic suppression.

P	A series of experiments examined human operators' strategies for interacting with highly ( 93% ) reliable automated decision aids in a binary signal detection task.
B	Operators often interact with automated decision aids in a suboptimal way , achieving performance levels lower than predicted by a statistically ideal model of information integration.
B	To better understand operators' inefficient use of decision aids , we compared participants' automation-aided performance levels with the predictions of seven statistical models of collaborative decision making.
M	Participants performed a binary signal detection task that asked them to classify random dot images as either blue or orange dominant.
M	They made their judgments either unaided or with assistance from a 93% reliable automated decision aid that provided either graded ( Experiments 1 and 3 ) or binary ( Experiment 2 ) cues.
M	We compared automation-aided performance with the predictions of seven statistical models of collaborative decision making , including a statistically optimal model and Robinson and Sorkin's contingent criterion model.
C	Automation-aided sensitivity hewed closest to the predictions of the two least efficient collaborative models , well short of statistically ideal levels.
C	Performance was similar whether the aid provided graded or binary judgments.
C	Model comparisons identified potential strategies by which participants integrated their judgments with the aid's.
C	Results lend insight into participants' automation-aided decision strategies and provide benchmarks for predicting automation-aided performance levels.
B	Preterm birth is associated with increased parental stress , worry , and anxiety , and affects parental-child interactional behaviour.
P	To evaluate the influence of length of antepartum hospital stay on maternal stress after the birth of a preterm infant.
M	A prospective two-centre pilot case-control study was performed at two tertiary level Neonatal-Intensive-Care-Units ( NICU ).
M	Mothers of preterm infants < 36( +0 ) weeks of gestation admitted to the NICUs were included.
M	The stress of mothers with length of antepartum hospital stay < 12 h ( n = 20 ) were case-matched and compared to that of mothers with length of antepartum hospital stay >= 12 h ( n = 20 ).
M	Maternal stress was assessed within three days after birth with the Parental-Stress-Scale: NICU ( PSS: NICU ) questionnaire measuring three scales: "relationship and parental role'' , "sights and sounds'' , and "baby looks and behaves''.
M	Maternal socio-demographic data were collected by questionnaire administered at the same time.
R	Both groups of mothers had similar socio-demographic data.
R	Stress scale of "sights and sounds'' was significantly increased in mothers with antepartum stay >= 12 h ( 2.48 +/- 0.69 ) compared to mothers with antepartum stay < 12 h ( 1.95 +/- 0.73 ) ( p = 0.024 ).
R	There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the "looks and behaves'' ( 2.73 +/- 0.80 vs. 2.72 +/- 0.91 ; p = 0.962 ) and "relationship and parental role'' scales ( 3.31 +/- 1.08 vs. 3.58 +/- 1.18 ; p = 0.484 ).
C	Our study demonstrated higher levels of maternal stress after preterm birth in mothers , who had been admitted to hospital for longer periods of time before delivery.
C	Interventional programmes starting in the antepartum period should be established in order to reduce the burden of stress and to improve parental-child interaction.

B	The severity of disability related to road traffic crashes has been little studied , despite the significant health and socio-economic impacts that determine victims' quality of life.
P	To estimate the consequences of road traffic crashes on the severity of disability , in terms of individuals' capacity to execute activities and perform tasks in their current environment , using aids.
M	Cross-sectional study conducted on community-dwelling participants in the "2008 National Survey of Disability" , with data on 91 ,846 households having 20 ,425 disabled persons , 443 of whom had disability due to road traffic crashes.
M	We measured severity using two indicators , i.e. , the Capacity ( CSI ) and Performance ( PSI ) Severity Indices.
R	The highest proportion of disability was mild ( CSI = 70.5% ; PSI = 80.8% ) , while 7.6% ( CSI ) and 4.9% ( PSI ) was severe/complete respectively.
R	The moderate/severe disability rate was 0.6 per thousand on the CSI , decreasing to 0.4 per thousand on the PSI.
R	No differences were observed by age or sex.
R	Moderate/severely disabled persons had a fourfold higher probability of being retired or unfit for work.
R	Mental and nervous system impairments were more closely related to moderate/severe/complete problems of capacity and performance ( p < 0.001 ) , disability for carrying out general tasks and demands , and interpersonal interactions and relationships ( p < 0.001 ).
R	Being permanently bedridden ( p < 0.001 ) , receiving aids ( p < 0.001 ) , family support ( p < 0.05 ) and moving home ( p < 0.05 ) increased with an increase in the level of severity.
C	Road traffic crashes mainly cause mild disability.
C	Moderate/severe disability is associated with lower work capacity , greater functional dependence , and increased need of aids , moving home and family support.

B	The provision of informed consent is a prerequisite for inclusion of a patient in a clinical research project.
B	In some countries , the legislation on clinical research authorizes a third person to provide informed consent if the patient is unable to do so directly ( i.e. surrogate consent ).
B	This is the case during acute stroke , when the symptoms may prevent the patient from providing informed consent and thus require a third party to be approached.
B	Identification of factors associated with the medical team's decision to resort to surrogate consent may ( i ) help the care team during the inclusion process and ( ii ) enable the patient's family circle to be better informed ( and thus feel less guilty ) about providing surrogate consent.
M	Patients included in the BIOSTROKE cohort ( initially dedicated to the analysis of factors influencing stroke severity ) were divided into two groups: those having provided informed consent directly and those for whom a third party ( such as a family member ) had provided surrogate consent.
M	We compared the groups in terms of the initial clinical characteristics ( age , gender , type of stroke , severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) , pre-stroke cognitive status according to the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly , and the stroke's aetiology ) and the functional and cognitive impairments ( according to the NIHSS , the modified Rankin score ( mRS ) and the Mini Mental State Examination ) on post-stroke days 8 and 90.
R	Three hundred and ninety five patients were included ( mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 15 years ; 53% males ).
R	Surrogate consent had been obtained in 228 cases , and 167 patients had provided consent themselves.
R	The patients included with surrogate consent were likely to be older and more aphasic , with a pre-existing cognitive disorder and more severe stroke ( relative to the patients having provided consent ).
R	In terms of recovery , the patients included with surrogate consent had a worse functional prognosis ( day 90 mRS >= 3: 57.6% , compared with 16.8% in patients having provided consent themselves ; p < 0.0001 ) and a worse cognitive prognosis ( day 90 MMS < 24: 15.4% and 4.8% , respectively ; p < 0.002 ).
R	The mortality rate was significantly higher in the surrogate consent group.
C	We found that in addition to age , aphasia and stroke severity , pre-stroke cognitive status is a factor that should prompt the care team to consider requesting surrogate consent for participation in a clinical study.
C	Given that the unfavourable outcome in patients with surrogate consent is often due to their initial clinical state ( rather than inclusion in a trial per se ) , the issue of the family's feelings of guilt ( and how to avoid these feelings ) should be further addressed.
B	This paper uses a theory from educational research - "the culture of power" to explore power differentials between academic researchers and community partners in community engaged research partnership programs.
P	This paper describes how a capacity-building program illuminated the tensions between academics and community partners related to power differentials and offers strategies for how to balance the power dynamic.
M	This paper relies on semi-structured interviews from 30 community partners who participated in the "Building your capacity" program.
R	The framework of "culture of power" applied to research relationships helps us understand the following: ( 1 ) The power differentials between academic institutions and community agencies are deeply entrenched.
R	That is there is a "culture of power."
R	( 2 ) This culture of power is often reinforced through the cultural rules and dominant language of the academy.
R	( 3 ) Academic institutions , by and large , have created and perpetuated the rules that have led to these uneven power relationships.
R	( 4 ) Being told explicitly about the rules of academic culture make acquiring power easier for community partners.
R	( 5 ) Community partners are often more aware of the culture of power in research and more willing to acknowledge these differentials than academic researchers.
C	Academic partners who want to work with community partners need to acknowledge these power imbalances and be intentional about shifting these power dynamics.
C	Capacity-building programs can help to shift these power imbalances because they help community partners acquire the confidence , knowledge and skills to advocate for more equitable research relationships
B	Cannabis use has been linked to anxiety and mood disorders ( AMD ) in clinical cases , but little research on this relationship has been reported at the epidemiological level.
P	We examined the relationship between self-reported frequency of cannabis use and risk for AMD in the general Ontario adult population.
M	Data were based on the CAMH Monitor survey of Ontario adults from 2001 to 2006 ( n = 14 ,531 ).
M	AMD was assessed with the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ12 ).
M	Frequency of cannabis use within the past year was grouped into five categories: No use ( abstainer ) , less than once a month but at least once a year , less than once a week but at least once a month , less than daily but at least once a week , almost every day to more than once a day.
M	Logistic regression analysis of AMD and cannabis use was implemented while controlling for demographics and alcohol problems.
R	AMD was most common among heavy cannabis users ( used almost every day or more ) ( 18.1% ) and lowest for abstainers ( 8.7% ).
R	Compared to abstainers , the risk of AMD was significantly greater for infrequent cannabis users ( OR = 1.43 ) and heavy cannabis users ( OR = 2.04 ) but not for those in between.
C	These data provide epidemiological evidence for a link between both light and heavy cannabis use and AMD.
C	Recognizing the comorbidity of heavy cannabis use and AMD should facilitate improved treatment efforts.
C	Our results also suggest the possibility that , for some individuals , AMD may occur at relatively low levels of cannabis use.

B	No study has applied the "fat-but-fit" paradigm with respect to muscular strength as an index of fitness , despite muscular strength being independently associated with functional ability and mortality.
P	To examine the relationship between lower extremity muscular strength , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and all-cause mortality among normal weight , overweight and obese individuals.
M	Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used ( N = 2740 adults ; >= 50 years ).
M	CRP values were obtained from a blood sample.
M	Lower body isokinetic knee extensor strength ( IKES ) was assessed using a Kin Kom MP isokinetic dynamometer.
M	Participant data was linked to death certificate data from the National Death Index to ascertain all-cause mortality status.
M	Participants were classified , based on body mass index ( BMI ) and strength as: normal weight and unfit ( <75th IKES percentile ) ; overweight and unfit ; obese and unfit: normal weight and fit ( >= 75th IKES percentile ) ; overweight and fit ; and obese and fit.
R	Independent of physical activity and other confounders , compared to those who were normal weight and unfit , unfit overweight ( beta = .14 , p = 0.009 ) , unfit obese ( beta = .33 , p < 0.001 ) , and obese and fit ( beta = .17 , p = 0.008 ) participants , had higher CRP levels.
R	However , there was no difference in CRP levels between normal weight and unfit participants and overweight and fit participants ( beta = 0.04 , p = 035 ).
R	Compared to normal weight unfit adults , overweight fit ( HR = 028 ; 95% CI: 0.11-0.70 ; p = 0.008 ) adults had a lower hazard rate for all-cause mortality.
C	These finding suggest that increased lower body strength , independent of physical activity , may reduce premature all-cause mortality and attenuate systemic inflammation among overweight adults.

P	Our aim was to determine the non-inferiority of normal saline flushing compared to heparin flushing in maintaining the patency of totally implanted venous access devices ( TIVADs ).
M	Four hundred and thirty patients were recruited from 14 Italian centres.
M	Patients were randomized to heparin group or to normal saline group.
M	The primary outcome of the study was TIVAD occlusion.
R	After randomisation , 203 patients were assigned to normal saline group and 212 to heparin group.
R	Median follow up time was 204 days in normal saline group and 294 in the heparin group.
R	We observed 24 withdrawal occlusions ( 5.78% ): 10 in the heparin group and 14 in the normal saline group.
R	One total occlusion was observed in the normal saline group.
R	Taking as reference the arm treated with heparin , the absolute risk difference was 2.67 with the 90% Cl including the non inferiority margin of 4%.
R	No significant difference between hazards of occlusion was found.
C	This study failed to demonstrate that normal saline flushing is not inferior to heparin flushing , even if a significant difference between the two treatments was not found.
C	The use of heparin is controversial and other prospective trials are necessary in this field.

B	Loneliness involves subjective , rather than objective , social isolation and has a range of negative effects on mental and physical functioning.
B	The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of loneliness in psychotic disorders and its association with symptoms and cognitive performance.
M	Data were drawn from the second Australian National Survey of Psychosis and comprised responses from 1642 participants with an International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnosis of psychotic disorder who had completed a semi-structured interview of symptoms and social functioning ( including loneliness ) , along with standardized assessments of current ( digit symbol coding ; DSC ) and premorbid ( National Adult Reading Test ) cognitive ability.
M	We examined the prevalence of loneliness across the diagnostic categories of psychosis , and its association with psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms and digit symbol coding scores.
R	The prevalence of loneliness was high , ranging from 74.75% in participants with delusional disorders to 93.8% in depressive psychosis , and was significantly higher than in the general population.
R	Loneliness was also significantly associated with anhedonia and subjective thought disorder.
R	Participants feeling socially isolated/lonely for company had significantly lower DSC scores than those who only felt lonely occasionally.
R	Unexpectedly , participants who reported not feeling lonely had the lowest DSC scores.
C	Loneliness is common across all psychotic disorders , particularly in depressive psychosis.
C	It is specifically associated with ongoing loss of pleasure and disordered thoughts as well as impairment in current cognitive functioning.
C	However , poor cognitive functioning is not inevitably associated with loneliness.
C	Implications for personalized treatment of psychosis are discussed.

P	American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN ) youth experience disparities associated with sexual and reproductive health , including early age of sexual initiation.
P	Identifying factors that are most proximally related to early sexual intercourse and that are modifiable through health promotion interventions may help to reduce these disparities.
P	Using a multisystem approach , we assessed individual ( biological , psychological , and behavioral ) , familial , and extrafamilial ( peer behavioral ) factors associated with lifetime sexual experience among AI/AN early adolescents living in three geographically dispersed U.S. regions.
M	We analyzed cross-sectional data from 537 AI/AN youth aged 12-14 years , recruited from 27 study sites in Alaska , Arizona , and the Pacific Northwest.
M	We used multilevel logistic regression models to estimate associations between independent variables and lifetime sexual intercourse ( oral and/or vaginal sex ) individually , within discrete systems , and across systems.
R	The analytical sample was 55.1% female , with a mean age of 13.2 years ( standard deviation = 1.06 years ) ; 6.5% were sexually experienced.
R	In the final model , we found that lower next-year intentions to have oral or vaginal sex ( psychological factors ) , avoidance of risky situations , and nonuse of alcohol ( behavioral factors ) were associated with lower odds of lifetime sexual intercourse ( all p <= .01 ).
R	No other variables were significantly associated with lifetime sexual intercourse.
C	Interventions that reduce sexual intentions , exposure to risky situations , and alcohol use may help to delay sexual initiation among AI/AN early adolescents.

B	Most people who collect and hoard , and then have difficulty discarding items , do not live in squalor , even though accumulation of hoarded items can make cleaning very difficult.
B	Commonly , people living in squalor accumulate garbage , but relatively few fulfill proposed criteria for "hoarding disorder."
B	We examined the overlap between hoarding and squalor among people referred because of unacceptable living conditions.
M	Ongoing collection of data by a Squalor Project team , including ratings on the Environmental Cleanliness and Clutter Scale ( ECCS ) , allowed ( 1 ) description of characteristics of cases and ( 2 ) examination of ratings of uncleanliness , and of the effect of accumulation of items or material on access within dwellings.
M	Principal component analysis was used to examine latent variables underlying the ECCS.
R	The mean age of the referred occupants ( 108 male , 95 female ) was 61.9 years.
R	The mean ECCS score in 186 rated cases was 18.5.
R	Factor analysis of ECCS data showed a two-factor solution as the most plausible.
R	Factor 1 , comprising seven squalor items , accounted for 33.7% of the variance.
R	Factor 2 comprised reduced accessibility and accumulation of items of little value ( variance 17.6% ).
R	Accumulation of garbage loaded equally on the two factors.
R	High levels of squalor and/or accumulation were recorded in 105 ( 56% ) of the 186 dwellings.
R	One-third scored high on accumulation/hoarding , while 38% scored high on squalor ; 15% scored high on both squalor and accumulation.
R	A quarter of those scoring high on squalor scored low on hoarding/accumulation.
C	The ECCS is useful when describing whether referred cases show high levels of squalor , hoarding , or both.
B	Response to antidepressants is higher in active comparator relative to placebo-controlled clinical trials.
B	Increased patient expectancy in comparator trials has been hypothesized to explain this finding , but previous analyses have not accounted for the increased dropout observed in placebo-controlled trials.
M	A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published antidepressant clinical trials reporting data on intent-to-treat ( ITT ) as well as completer patient populations.
M	The influence of participant drop-out on observed antidepressant response was investigated by comparing the ITT and completer data sets in separate multilevel meta-analyses of antidepressant response in placebo-controlled and comparator trials.
R	18 placebo-controlled and 18 active comparator studies were available for analysis.
R	Using the intent-to-treat data , the odds of responding to medication in comparator trials were 1.9 times the odds in placebo-controlled trials ( 95% Cl = 1.3-2.7 , p = 0.001 ).
R	The same pattern was obtained among study completers , in whom the odds of responding to antidepressant medication were 1.9 times higher in comparator as opposed to placebo-controlled study designs ( 95% CI = 1.2-3.0 , p = 0.009 ).
C	Publication bias , the use of trial-level summary data , and unreported clinical or demographic differences between the ITT and completer patient populations may have influenced the study results.
C	Increased drop-out in placebo-controlled vs. active comparator studies of antidepressant medications does not appear to explain the difference in response rates between these study types.
C	Rather , increased patient expectancy resulting from the certainty of receiving active medication in comparator trials may lead to improved response rates.

P	We advanced a multifactorial , dynamic account of the complex , nonlinear interactions of motor , linguistic , and emotional factors contributing to the development of stuttering.
P	Our purpose here is to update our account as the multifactorial dynamic pathways theory.
M	We review evidence related to how stuttering develops , including genetic/epigenetic factors ; motor , linguistic , and emotional features ; and advances in neuroimaging studies.
M	We update evidence for our earlier claim: Although stuttering ultimately reflects impairment in speech sensorimotor processes , its course over the life span is strongly conditioned by linguistic and emotional factors.
R	Our current account places primary emphasis on the dynamic developmental context in which stuttering emerges and follows its course during the preschool years.
R	Rapid changes in many neurobehavioral systems are ongoing , and critical interactions among these systems likely play a major role in determining persistence of or recovery from stuttering.
C	Stuttering , or childhood onset fluency disorder ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th edition ; American Psychiatric Association [APA] , 2013 ) , is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins when neural networks supporting speech , language , and emotional functions are rapidly developing.
C	The multifactorial dynamic pathways theory motivates experimental and clinical work to determine the specific factors that contribute to each child's pathway to the diagnosis of stuttering and those most likely to promote recovery.
B	The development of safe and effective mental health services is a priority.
B	This requires valid measures of personal recovery , yet these tools are not embedded in routine clinical practice.
B	Brief "patient reported measures'' are most likely to be acceptable to service-users and clinicians.
B	The 4-item "Hope , Agency and Opportunity'' ( HAO ) was co-produced to assess recovery outcomes and experience of mental health services.
P	To evaluate the psychometric properties of the HAO.
M	A clinical sample from secondary healthcare services and a non-clinical sample were assessed at baseline and two weeks , on measures of personal recovery.
R	Factor analysis indicated goodness of fit for the HAO with both clinical and non-clinical samples.
R	The measure demonstrated acceptable internal consistency , moderate to strong construct validity and substantial test-retest reliability over two weeks.
C	The HAO demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties.
C	Co-production of the measure confers clinical credibility.
C	The brevity of the tool means it can be incorporated into routine clinical practice to drive improvements in service quality.
B	Many emergency departments use a rating system to establish priority based on urgency: "triage".
B	The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of triage in predicting hospitalization and mortality compared to that of the ICD-9-CM based Injury Severity Score ( ISS ).
M	Sources: The Emergency Information System 2000 , the Hospital Information System 2000-2001 and the Mortality Register 2000-2001 , of the Lazio Region.
M	Case selection: Emergency department visits for traumas that occurred on the road or at home.
R	Hospitalization and 30-day mortality.
R	For each case , trauma diagnoses from the ICD-9-CM were given a corresponding ISS value.
R	We performed logistic models , including age , sex and , alternatively , triage or ISS.
R	We compared discrimination measures and calibration of the models.
R	Out of 264.709 emergency department visits , 22.249( 8.4% ) were followed by a hospitalization and 655( 0.2% ) died within 30 days.
R	ISS scores were calculated for 72 ,179( 27% ) cases.
R	Of the most urgent triage ( 840 patients ) , 78.3% ( 658 ) were hospitalized and 9% ( 76 ) died , while among patients with ISS >= 16 value ( 1276 ) 36.4% ( 464 ) of were hospitalized and 1.8% ( 23 ) died.
R	Measures of discrimination and calibration showed similar results.
R	The triage model had a better fitness in predicting hospitalization probability for home accidents ( Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic: chi( 2 )( triage ) = 5.5 VS chi( 2 )( ISS ) = 34.3 ) and had a better performance for road accidents ( ROC( triage ) = 0.71 vs ROC( ISS ) = 0.66 ).
R	There were no differences between the models in predicting the probability of death.
C	The agreement between the two scales confirms the validity of triage as a clinical management tool in the emergency department , and as a proxy of trauma severity.

P	Researchers examined college students' financial health and other health indicators to determine whether the integration of financial health into undergraduate health courses is justified and justify financial health as the newest dimension of health within the field of health promotion.
M	The study utilized a cross-sectional design.
M	The study was conducted at a large public university located in the western region of the United States.
M	Participants completed the survey from any computer with Internet access.
M	A sample of 3000 undergraduate students was selected.
M	A total of 686 surveys were completed ( 22.9% response rate ).
M	Data were collected from college students ages 18 to 30 during the first 2 weeks of June 2013.
M	Participants completed an online survey regarding their financial health and other dimensions of health.
M	SPSS version 19.0 was used to examine the relationships between financial health and individual health variables using ( 2 ) , independent t-test , analysis of variance , Pearson R , point-biserial correlation , and nonparametric analyses.
R	Every dimension of health was impacted significantly by lower levels of financial health.
R	Participants' emotional health was impacted far more than any other dimension , with significant impacts on concentration ( p= .005 ) , usefulness ( p= .006 ) , decision making ( p= .014 ) , and happiness ( p < .001 ) by the mere presence of a budget.
C	Findings indicate an apparent relationship between financial health and other health indicators and support the need for financial education by parents and middle/high schools and the incorporation of financial health into undergraduate health courses.
B	Low-income and middle-income countries have a lot of problems in providing the financial , human , and capital resources for advanced medical imaging technologies ( AMITs ).
B	Proper distribution of such expensive equipment might increase access to these services and enhance the quality and efficiency of health care.
B	The present study aimed to identify the factors affecting the diffusion of AMITs including CT and MRI in Iran.
M	This is a qualitative research conducted in 2017.
M	A number of purposively chosen policy makers and managers from Ministry of Health , medical universities , hospitals , health insurance , and vendor companies were approached for face-to-face and semistructured interviews.
M	Data analysis was done using thematic analysis method.
R	Three categories of influential factors were identified , including contextual , stakeholder related , and situational factors.
R	With regards to the stakeholders , the ministry and physicians played the most important role in the diffusion process of the AMITs.
R	Health insurance organizations and vendor companies played a minor role in distribution of the equipment.
R	Application of political pressure by the authorities on the Ministry of Health to issue licenses for the acquisition of AMITs was taken as the most important factor and the greatest challenge in the diffusion of devices.
C	The results sought to assist health system authorities to manage diffusion of AMITs effectively and assign an equitable access to the expensive resources.
C	The diffusion management together with utilization management could largely improve efficiency and cost containment.
C	Medical technology diffusion management de facto needs policy instruments in both supply and demand sides.
B	Patients with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) have significantly reduced quality of life ( QOL ).
B	Although intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms , as well as comorbid psychological disorders , may reduce the QOL of IBS patients , the primary determinant of QOL in these patients remains unclear.
B	This study aimed to identify the main factors affecting QOL in patients with IBS with diarrhea ( IBS-D ).
M	Consecutive patients meeting the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for IBS-D were enrolled in this study.
M	Patients with organic diseases were excluded.
M	The intestinal symptoms , psychological states and QOL of these patients were evaluated using IBS-specific symptom questionnaires , the Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAMD ) , the Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAMA ) , and the Chinese version of the IBS-QOL instrument.
M	Overall scores for intestinal symptoms were calculated by frequency and degree.
R	This study enrolled 227 IBS-D patients , of mean age 44.68 +/- 10.81 years.
R	Their mean overall IBS-QOL score was 71.68 +/- 18.54 , with the lowest score being for food avoidance ( 53.71 +/- 26.92 ).
R	Overall IBS-QOL score correlated negatively with overall scores of intestinal symptoms and HAMD and HAMA scores ( p < 0.001 each ).
R	Overall intestinal symptoms scores correlated negatively with HAMD and HAMA scores ( p < 0.001 each ).
R	Scores of HAMD , HAMA and structural factors ( i.e. , anxiety/somatization , cognitive disorder , psychomotor retardation , psychic anxiety , and somatic anxiety ) were significantly higher in female than in male patients ( p < 0.01 ).
R	Food avoidance and social reaction scores of female patients were significantly lower than those of male patients ( p < 0.05 each ).
R	The degree of defecation urgency , frequency of passing mucus and psychomotor retardation were independent factors predicting reduced QOL in IBS-D patients.
C	Intestinal symptoms and psychological factors jointly reduce the QOL of IBS-D patients , with gender differences in the impact of both factors on QOL.
B	The choice between different attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) medications depends on different drug attributes.
B	Economic evaluations of drugs often disregard the utility of other attributes compare with the drugs' efficacy.
P	The aim of this study was to assess patient's preferences and elicit willingness-to-pay ( WTP ) for different drug attributes in the treatment of ADHD.
M	285 patients ( 117 parents for children below 15 years , 52 adolescents 15-17 years and 116 adults aged 18 years and above ) from Sweden , Denmark and Norway completed a questionnaire concerning their ADHD drug treatment , and answered questions on their preferences using a discrete choice experiment ( DCE ).
M	Included attributes were effectiveness , side-effects , dosing and price.
R	Effectiveness was the most important attribute , followed by side-effects and the number of dosings per day ( all P < 0.001 ).
R	The estimated monthly WTP for a drug generating full effectiveness , no side-effects and once-daily dosing was ( sic )790 for adolescents and ( sic )360 for adults.
R	The estimated WTP for ADHD drugs with characteristics similar to existing drugs on the market was higher or in line with market prices ( ( sic )37-180 for adolescents and ( sic )16-80 for adults ).
R	Regarding experience with current treatment , 19% of all patients in the study reported good functioning during the morning , day and evening.
C	The gap between the monetary valuation of existing products and an optimally valued product suggest that there is room for improvements in the clinical management of ADHD.
C	The results suggest that DCE is a method that can be used to value not only hypothetical scenarios but also can be used to value and distinguish between real-life scenarios.
P	To analyze the distribution rate of legal suits according to drug ( manufacturer ) , prescribing physician , and attorney filing the lawsuit.
M	A descriptive study was carried out to assess the lawsuits in the Sao Paulo State ( Southeastern Brazil ) courts registry in 2006 , and amounts spent in complying with these lawsuits , and total costs with medication thus resulting.
R	In 2006 , the Sao Paulo State Administration spent 65 million Brazilian reais in compliance with court decisions to provide medication to approximately 3 ,600 individuals.
R	The total cost of the medication was 1.2 billion Brazilian reais.
R	In the period studied , 2 ,927 lawsuits were examined.
R	These lawsuits were filed by 565 legal professionals , among which 549 were attorneys engaged by private individuals ( 97.17% of the total legal professionals ).
R	The drugs scope of the lawsuits had been prescribed by 878 different physicians.
R	By assessing the number of lawsuits filed per attorney , it was found that 35% of them were brought before the courts by 1% of them.
C	The data related to the lawsuits and to the medication classified according to manufacturer , show that a small number of attorneys is responsible for the largest number of lawsuits filed to obtain these drugs.
C	The finding that more than 70% of the lawsuits filed for certain drugs are the responsibility of one single attorney , may suggest a close connection between this professional and the manufacturer.
B	A range of indicators point to an international increase in the prevalence of performance and image-enhancing drugs ( PIEDs ) use , predominantly among young men.
B	Attention to PIEDs-related benefits , adverse health effects , information and health service access are needed.
M	A cross-sectional survey of 605 men who inject PIEDs was conducted at nine primary needle and syringe programme locations across five local health districts in Sydney.
R	Among anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) users ( n= 564 ) , anger , rage or irritability ( 27% , 95%CI: 23.4-30.6 ) and sexual or genital problems ( 26.4% , 95%CI: 22.9-30.0 ) were the most commonly reported adverse health effects.
R	Taking regular , longer breaks between AAS cycles were associated with reduced reports of some adverse effects.
R	Approaching two-thirds of participants had told a doctor about using PIEDs ( 63.1% , 95%CI: 59.1-67.1 ).
R	However , as length of time since first injecting PIEDs increased , participants' perceptions of doctors as reliable information sources decreased ( rho=-0.10 , p=0.04 ).
R	Reliance on lay information sources was very common , particularly among people who spoke languages other than English.
C	This study supports providing information on cycle lengths and break periods as part of standard PIEDs-related harm reduction guidelines.
C	Safe injecting and dosage education through peer networks or steroid clinics may be useful strategies.
P	The purpose of this study is to examine patterns in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) outpatient mental health services including cost and length of services , return to care rates , and dropout by the presence of commonly co-morbid mental health conditions , modality and provider type.
M	This study is a longitudinal , retrospective study using administrative data from Cigna , a leading health care insurance provider in the U.S. Participants ( n = 1614 , ages 1-61 ) included individuals diagnosed with an ASD from 2001 to 2006 , who had claims for outpatient mental health services.
R	Across all age groups , the cost and length variables were lowest for family therapy , followed by individual therapy.
R	Mixed therapy ( combination of family and individual therapy ) was significantly longer and more costly.
R	Rates of dropout and return to care were lowest for mixed therapy.
R	Dropout was significantly higher for children than for adults or adolescents.
R	Among provider types , social workers had the lowest cost among adolescents and the highest return to care rates among adults and counselors had the longest service length and the lowest dropout rates among children.

B	Breast cancer is a significant women's health problem in the United States.
B	However , critical information on specific populations is still lacking.
B	In particular , it is not well known how free clinic patients perceive breast health.
B	The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge and perceptions of breast health among uninsured women utilizing a free clinic that serves as a safety net for the underserved.
M	A self-administrated survey that included knowledge and perceptions of breast health was conducted for female free clinic patients aged 40 or older in fall 2012.
M	There were 146 participants.
M	The participants were classified into three groups for comparison ; U.S. citizen English speakers , non-U.S. citizen English speakers , and Spanish speakers.
R	Spanish speakers had the highest average score on the knowledge of breast health , whereas the non-U.S. citizen English speakers had the lowest average score.
R	Free clinic patients may consider breast health screening if recommended by health care providers.
R	The non-U.S. citizen English speakers and Spanish speakers were more likely to have negative perceptions of breast health compared with the U.S. citizen English speakers.
C	Promoting knowledge about breast health is important for free clinics.
C	Recommendation by a health care provider is a key to increasing attendance at health education programs and breast health screening.
C	Non-U.S. citizens and non-English speakers would need culturally competent interventions.
C	Free clinics have limited human and financial resources.
C	Such characteristics of free clinics should be considered for practice implementations.

P	Although researchers have concluded that child maltreatment has a negative effect on children's learning and academic achievement , not all children are negatively affected by maltreatment , and some children seem to succeed academically despite being maltreated.
P	Drawing on risk and resilience theory , we examined a broad range of potential risk , promotive , and protective factors within children and their environments along with characteristics of the maltreatment to account for variability in test scores.
M	A national longitudinal probability sample of 702 maltreated school-aged children , ages 6-10 , and their caregivers was used to predict reading and math scores among maltreated children over three years.
R	We found that chronic maltreatment , poorer daily living skills , and lower intelligence explained a substantial proportion of the variance in maltreated children's math scores ( 39% ) , whereas type of maltreatment , poorer daily living skills and lower intelligence explained a substantial proportion of the variance in reading scores ( 54% ) over time.
R	Contrary to our prediction , having a behavior problem seemed to protect chronically maltreated children from poorer performance in math over time.
C	To increase academic achievement among maltreated children , it is imperative that we prevent chronic maltreatment and help children increase their competency on daily living skills.

B	Return-to-work ( RTW ) programmes for injured workers have been prevalent in Western countries with established work injury management policies for decades.
B	In recent years , more Asian countries have started to develop RTW programmes in the absence of work injury management policies.
B	However , few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of RTW programmes in Asia.
P	Return-to-work coordination has been found to be an important facilitator in RTW programmes.
P	This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of a Return-to-work coordinator ( RTWC ) model of care in facilitating early RTW for injured workers in Singapore.
M	A randomized controlled trial was used.
M	160 injured workers in a general hospital were randomly allocated to either control ( receive usual hospital standard care ) or intervention ( assigned a RTWC ) group.
M	The RTWC closely supported RTW arrangements and proactively liaised with employers and healthcare professionals on RTW solutions for the injured workers.
R	At three months post injury , workers in the intervention group RTW 10 days earlier than the control group , with a higher proportion of workers in the intervention group returning to modified jobs.
R	There were no significant differences in the quality of life measures between the two groups.
C	The addition of a RTWC into the hospital model of care is effective in facilitating early RTW for injured workers.
C	This could be a potential model of care for injured workers in Asian countries where work injury management policies are not yet established.
B	Despite the wide range of studies concerning physician satisfaction in different European countries , there is a lack of literature reviews synthesizing and analyzing current evidence evaluating satisfaction of physicians working in European hospitals.
B	The goal of our research was to provide a general overview of the studies in this area and their results.
M	We searched MEDLINE , Embase , PsycINFO , CINAHL and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 to January 2017 including both MESH/Emtree terms and free text words related to the subject with no language restrictions.
M	The eligibility criteria included: ( i ) target population: physicians working in European hospitals , ( ii ) quantitative research aimed at assessing physician satisfaction and ( iii ) validated tools.
M	We performed a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis.
R	A total of 8585 abstracts and 368 full text articles were independently screened by 2 reviewers against inclusion/exclusion criteria.
R	Finally 61 studies were eligible for qualitative analysis.
R	Included studies enrolled a total of 50 001 physicians from 17 countries.
R	Sample sizes varied between 54 and 7090 participants ( median: 336 ).
R	According to our review similar to 59% of physicians working in European hospitals are overall satisfied , 3.54 was the mean satisfaction among studies reporting data on a scale from 1 to 5 , 4.81 for studies with a scale from 1 to 7 , 6.12 among studies reporting data on a scale from 1 to 10 , and 59.65 among studies with a scale from 0 to 100.
C	The level of physician satisfaction in Europe is moderate.
C	There is a large variety of tools and scales used to assess it.
B	Visceral fat has been shown to be an important predictor of metabolic alterations that lead to increased cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors , morbidity , and mortality.
P	The aim of this study was to investigate the association between central fat distribution and the risk of recurrent coronary events among a cohort of female myocardial infarction ( MI ) survivors.
M	Participants included 356 women ( mean +/- SD age , 55 +/- 8.71 years ) discharged alive after an incident MI from hospitals in Erie and Niagara ( New York ) counties between 1996 and 2004.
M	A recurrent cardiovascular event was any nonfatal or fatal International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision-coded diagnosis between 390 and 450.
M	The mean +/- SD follow-up time was 4.01 +/- 2.6 years.
M	Interviews and self-administered follow-up surveys were used to collect pertinent information , and a search of the National Death Index Plus database was completed.
R	Eighty-five women experienced a recurrent cardiovascular event.
R	Using Cox proportional hazards analyses , the crude model for body mass index suggested that after incident MI , women had a 39% risk of a recurrent CVD event ( hazard ratio [HR] , 1.39 ; confidence interval [CI] , 0.76-2.54 ; P = .293 ) , whereas crude models for waist circumference and sagittal abdominal distention showed the risk to be more than twice as high ( HR , 2.12 ; CI , 1.08-4.16 ; P = .010 ; and HR , 2.16 ; CI , 1.09-4.28 ; P = .037 , respectively ).
R	Both measures of central fat distribution appeared to be better predictors of recurrent cardiovascular events when compared with body mass index , whereas sagittal abdominal distention was the better predictor compared with waist circumference , even after multivariate adjustment.
R	After adjusting for secondary prevention interventions-statin , aspirin , beta-blocker use , and physical activity-the risk of recurrent event was observed to decrease by about 1%.
C	These results suggest that central fat distribution is positively associated with a recurrence of cardiovascular events after incident MI in women.
C	The absence of decreased risk with secondary prevention interventions suggests that more investigation into the association of central abdominal fat and secondary prevention management is warranted.
P	This article presents a pilot study exploring the applicability of a linguistically adapted , solution-focused brief therapy ( SFBT ) program , implemented by social workers in Chilean primary care.
M	We completed a single-case design with eight replications.
M	To analyze the results of the program on participants' alcohol use and other related variables , we conducted visual and percentage of nonoverlapping data analyses.
R	Social workers successfully implemented 10 of the 13 SFBT techniques.
R	Although results need to be interpreted with caution , positive trends were observed.
R	Participants increased their "percentage of days abstinent ," diminished "consequences of alcohol use ," decreased their "depression index ," and increased their "self-reported well-being."
C	Results are consistent with previous studies on SFBT and alcohol use.
C	Exception and coping questions may serve to increase abstinent days.
C	SFBT focus on issues other than alcohol that are important to clients could help to reduce harm on individuals who use alcohol.
P	This study investigated the impact of lexical characteristics on the intelligibility of speakers with Parkinson's disease ( PD ).
P	Intelligibility was compared for listening in a quiet versus a noisy environment.
M	A total of 192 young listeners participated in the study , with 96 listeners listening in quiet and 96 listening in noise in which the spoken sentences were mixed with 10-talker babble.
M	The listeners transcribed spoken sentences with target words controlled for word frequency and neighborhood density.
M	The sentences were produced by 12 speakers with PD and 12 healthy control ( HC ) speakers.
M	Transcription accuracy was compared across lexical categories between PD and HC and between the two listening conditions.0
R	Transcription accuracy was higher for high-frequency words than low-frequency words for both speaker groups in quiet and in noise.
R	The neighborhood density effect was evident only in the noise condition with better intelligibility for words from sparse neighborhoods than from dense neighborhoods.
R	Regardless of listening condition , the PD group was less intelligible with a significant decrease in intelligibility in noise relative to quiet.
C	The lexical properties of the words affected listeners' understanding of Parkinsonian speech.
C	Frequent words in sparse neighborhood enhanced intelligibility , especially under adverse listening conditions.
C	Babble noise had a detrimental impact on the intelligibility of Parkinsonian speech.
C	The extent of the lexical effect on intelligibility increased in noise.
P	This randomized controlled trial was carried out to investigate the effect of mindfulness eating and yoga exercise on blood sugar levels among pregnant Thai women with GDM.
B	Interventions promoting achievement of good glycemic control result in desired pregnancy outcomes.
B	Little is known about the health benefits of mindfulness eating and yoga exercise on blood sugar levels among pregnant with GDM.
M	A randomized controlled trial was carried out.
M	Main outcome measures were capillary fasting plasma glucose , 2-h postprandial blood glucose , and hemoglobin A1c.
R	The intervention group showed significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose , 2-h postprandial blood glucose , and glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.05 ).
C	Mindfulness eating and yoga exercise had health benefits on glycemic control in pregnant women with GDM.
C	It should be recommended in clinical and community health services.

B	The representation of women in physics majors is persistently low despite ongoing calls for reforms to improve gender equality.
B	This article builds upon prior research by applying the sociocognitive construct of self-determination in analysing women's experiences leading to their choice of physics study , along with factors affecting their behavioural persistence and physics identity.
P	The purpose of the study was to examine variables affecting women's physics identities and persistence in pursuing their physics degrees.
P	Factors were explored that impacted the self-determination of women in physics , that is , how their personal resources and socialisation facilitated regulatory behaviours to be successful in the major.
M	Six women physics majors were recruited from a research university in the Northeast U.S. , where all had participated in undergraduate physics research.
M	This qualitative cross-case study focused on undergraduate women to analyse factors that influenced their experiences in the major.
M	Data collection focused on motivation and support , challenges they encountered , and how they overcame them.
M	By examining these factors , common themes were identified regarding their recruitment and retention in physics , specifically in terms of social integration and external validation.
M	Interview transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological approach to generate a set of integrated themes providing a theoretical explanation for physics major selection and persistence that incorporated aspects of competence , autonomy and social relatedness.
R	The support of faculty , research opportunities and peer socialisation were factors that contributed to the development of self-determination.
R	Hindrances that impacted women's undergraduate experiences included negative gender stereotypes , persistent self-doubt , minority status and unwelcoming classroom cultures.
R	Self-determination was characterised by social integration , confidence , and individual and collective agency.
C	A new explanatory framework for the persistence of women in undergraduate physics is proposed , suggesting self-determination is facilitated by external validation , which in turn moderates the impact of personal and social tensions.
P	The authors examined the impact of barium on the perceived taste intensity of 7 different liquid tastant stimuli and the modulatory effect that these differences in perceived taste intensity have on swallowing behaviors.
M	Participants were 80 healthy women , stratified by age group ( <40 ; >60 ) and genetic taste status ( supertasters ; nontasters ).
M	Perceived taste intensity and chemesthetic properties ( fizziness ; burning-stinging ) were rated for 7 tastant solutions ( each prepared with and without barium ) using the general Labeled Magnitude Scale.
M	Tongue-palate pressures and submental surface electromyography ( sEMG ) were simultaneously measured during swallowing of these same randomized liquids.
M	Path analysis differentiated the effects of stimulus , genetic taste status , age , barium condition , taste intensity , and an effortful saliva swallow strength covariate on swallowing.
R	Barium stimuli were rated as having reduced taste intensity compared with nonbarium stimuli.
R	Barium also dampened fizziness but did not influence burning-stinging sensation.
R	The amplitudes of tongue-palate pressure or submental sEMG did not differ when swallowing barium versus nonbarium stimuli.
C	Despite impacting taste intensity , the addition of barium to liquid stimuli does not appear to alter behavioral parameters of swallowing.
C	Barium solutions can be considered to elicit behaviors that are similar to those used with nonbarium liquids outside the assessment situation.
B	In medical education research , various questionnaires are often used to study possible relationships between strategies and approaches to teaching and learning and the outcome of these.
B	However , judging the applicability of such questionnaires or the interpretation of the results is not trivial.
M	As a way to develop teacher thinking , teaching strategy profiles were calculated for teachers in a research intensive department at Karolinska Institutet.
M	This study compares the sum score , that was inherent in the questionnaire used , with an Item Response Theory ( IRT ) approach.
M	Three teaching dimensions were investigated and the intended sum scores were investigated by IRT analysis.
R	Agreements as well as important differences were found.
R	The use of the sum score seemed to agree reasonably with an IRT approach for two of the dimensions , while the third dimension could not be identified neither by a the sum score , nor by an IRT approach , as the items included showed conflicting messages.
C	This study emphasizes the possibilities to gain better insight and more relevant interpretation of a questionnaire by use of IRT.
C	A sum score approach should not be taken for granted.
C	Its use has to be thoroughly evaluated.
B	At least 60% of young people in the UK who are accessing youth justice services present with speech , language and communication difficulties which are largely unrecognized.
B	The contributing reasons for this are discussed , suggesting that early language difficulty is a risk factor for other problems such as literacy difficulties and educational failure that may increasingly put the young person at risk of offending.
B	Opportunities for identification and remediation of language difficulties before young people reach youth justice services are also outlined.
P	To examine language skills in a sample of children in a secure children's home aged 11-17 years.
M	A sample of 118 males were routinely assessed on four Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Fundamentals ( CELF ) subtests and the British Picture Vocabulary Scale ( BPVS ).
R	Around 30% of the participants presented with language difficulties scoring 1.5 SD ( standard deviation ) below the mean on the assessments.
R	Despite them entering the home because their vulnerability was recognized , only two participants had a previous record of language difficulties.
R	A total of 20% of the participants had a diagnosis of mental illness , 50% had a history of drug abuse and 31% had looked-after status prior to entry to the home.
R	Conclusions & implications: Children experiencing educational or emotional difficulties need to be routinely assessed for speech , language and communication difficulties.
R	More population-based approaches to supporting the development of oral language skills in children and young people are also supported.
B	The tissue biobanking of specific biological residual materials , which constitutes a useful resource for medical/scientific research , has raised some ethical issues , such as the need to define which kind of consent is applicable for biological residual materials biobanks.
C	Biobank research cannot be conducted without considering arguments for obtaining the donors' consent: in this paper we discuss to what extent consent in biobank research on oncological residual materials has to be required , and what type of consent would be appropriate in this context , considering the ethical principles of donation , solidarity , protection of the donors' rights and the requirements of scientific progress.
C	Regarding the relationship between informed consent and tissue collection , storage and research , we have focused on two possible choices related to the treatment of data and samples in the biobank: irreversible and reversible anonymization of the samples , distinguishing between biobank research on residual materials for which obtaining consent is necessary and justified , and biobank research for which it is not.
C	The procedures involve different approaches and possible solutions that we will seek to define.
C	The consent for clinical research reported in the Helsinki Declaration regards research involving human beings and for this reason it is subordinate to specific and detailed information on the research projects.
C	An important ethical aspect in regard to the role of Biobanks is encouraging sample donation.
C	For donors , seeing human samples being kept rather than discarded , and seeing them become useful for research highlights the importance of the human body and improves the attitude towards donation.
C	This process might also facilitate the giving of informed consent more willingly , and with greater trust.
B	This study followed On findings from a recent genome-wide association study of PTSD that implicated the retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha ( RORA ) gene ( Logue et al. , 2012 ) by examining its relationship to broader array of disorders.
M	Using data from the same cohort ( N=540 ) , we analyzed patterns of association between 606 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) spanning the RORA gene and comorbidity factors termed tear , distress ( i.e. , internalizing factors ) and externalizing.
R	Results showed that rs17303244 was associated with the fear component of internalizing ( i.e. , defined by symptoms of panic , agoraphobia , specific phobia , and obsessive-compulsive disorder ) at a level of significance that withstood correction for gene-wide multiple testing.
C	The primary limitations were the modest size of the cohort and the absence of a replication sample.
C	Results add to a growing literature implicating the RORA gene in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders and offer new insight into possible molecular mechanisms of the effects of traumatic stress on the brain and the role of genetic factors in those processes.

B	Changes in resident outcomes may be driven by many factors , including changes in nursing home care processes.
B	Understanding what processes , if any , lead to successful improvements in resident outcomes could create a stronger case for the continued use of these outcome measures in nursing home report cards.
P	To test the extent to which improvements in outcomes of care are explained by changes in nursing home processes , a setting where , to our knowledge , this link has not been previously studied.Research Design/
M	We describe facility-level changes in resident processes and outcomes before and after outcomes were publicly reported.
M	We then assess the extent to which the changes in outcomes are associated with changes in nursing home processes of care , using the public release of information on nursing home outcomes as a source of variation in nursing home outcomes to identify the process-outcome relationship.
M	All 16 ,623 US nursing homes included in public reporting from 2000 to 2009 in Online Survey , Certification and Reporting and the nursing home Minimum Data Set.
R	Of the 5 outcome measures examined , only improvements in the percentage of nursing home residents in moderate or severe pain were associated with changes in nursing home processes of care.
R	Furthermore , these changes in the measured process of care explained only a small part of the overall improvement in pain prevalence.
C	A large portion of the improvements in nursing home outcomes were not associated with changes in measured processes of care suggesting that processes of care typically measured in nursing homes do little to improve nursing home performance on outcome measures.
C	Developing quality measures that are related improved patient outcomes would likely benefit quality improvement.
C	Understanding the mechanism behind improvements in nursing home outcomes is key to successfully achieving broad quality improvements across nursing homes.
B	Previous research indicates that both pain severity and interference caused by pain should be addressed in the recovery period following total knee arthroplasty.
P	This research describes the range of pain severity of patients in the first 48 hours postoperation , ways in which pain interferes with activities , and the observed differences in pain experience by patients' age , level of education , race , and gender , using the Brief Pain Inventory.
P	ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used to assess the data.
C	Of the participants , 12% reported severe pain and 35% reported severe interference with general activities.
C	Pain interfered most with walking , activities , and physical therapy.
C	There were no differences by race , gender , or education.
C	Older participants reported less pain and less interference.
C	Participants reporting nonsurgical pain reported more interference with mood , walking , relationships with other people , and sleep.
C	RECOMMENDATIONS: Pain evaluation should include an assessment of pain unrelated to the surgical procedure.
C	Additional research exploring the impact of nonpostoperative surgical pain during the postoperative period is needed.
B	The coverage of prevention and treatment strategies for ischemic heart disease and stroke is very low in Ethiopia.
B	In view of Ethiopia's meager healthcare budget , it is important to identify the most cost-effective interventions for further scale-up.
B	This paper's objective is to assess cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) and stroke in an Ethiopian setting.
M	Fifteen single interventions and sixteen intervention packages were assessed from a healthcare provider perspective.
M	The World Health Organization's Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective model for cardiovascular disease was updated with available country-specific inputs , including demography , mortality and price of traded and non-traded goods.
M	Costs and health benefits were discounted at 3 % per year.
M	Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are reported in US$per disability adjusted life year ( DALY ) averted.
M	Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess robustness of our results.
R	Combination drug treatment for individuals having > 35 % absolute risk of a CVD event in the next 10 years is the most cost-effective intervention.
R	This intervention costs US$67 per DALY averted and about US$7 million annually.
R	Treatment of acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ( costing US$1000-US$7530 per DALY averted ) and secondary prevention of IHD and stroke ( costing US$1060-US$10 ,340 per DALY averted ) become more efficient when delivered in integrated packages.
R	At an annual willingness-to-pay ( WTP ) level of about US$3 million , a package consisting of aspirin , streptokinase , ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker for AMI has the highest probability of being most cost-effective , whereas as WTP increases to > US$7 million , combination drug treatment to individuals having > 35 % absolute risk stands out as the most cost-effective strategy.
R	Cost-effectiveness ratios were relatively more sensitive to halving the effectiveness estimates as compared with doubling the price of drugs and laboratory tests.
C	In Ethiopia , the escalating burden of CVD and its risk factors warrants timely action.
C	We have demonstrated that selected CVD intervention packages could be scaled up at a modest budget increase.
C	The level of willingness-to-pay has important implications for interventions' probability of being cost-effective.
C	The study provides valuable evidence for setting priorities in an essential healthcare package for CVD in Ethiopia.
B	Baclofen , a GABAB receptor agonist , is under investigation as a pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder.
B	Treatment with a pharmacotherapeutic can be initiated during alcohol abstinence or active drinking , which may influence treatment outcomes.
B	This study examined whether baclofen treatment initiated and maintained during alcohol abstinence would reduce alcohol seeking and self-administration upon return to alcohol access , and whether effects differed from treatment initiated and maintained during ongoing alcohol access.
B	Naltrexone was tested under similar conditions for comparison.
M	Five baboons self-administered alcohol under a three-component chained schedule of reinforcement that modeled periods of anticipation ( Component 1 ) , seeking ( Component 2 ) , and consumption ( Component 3 ).
M	Alcohol was only available in Component 3.
M	In Experiment 1 , baclofen ( 0.1-1.8 mg/kg ) or naltrexone ( 1.0-5.6 mg/kg ) was administered daily beginning on the first day of a 5-day abstinence period and treatment was continued for 5 days of alcohol access.
M	In Experiment 2 , selected doses of both drugs were administered during ongoing alcohol access.
R	When treatment was initiated during alcohol abstinence , baclofen and naltrexone did not significantly reduce total alcohol intake ( g/kg ) or alcohol seeking.
R	In comparison , when treatment was initiated during ongoing alcohol access , both baclofen ( 1.8 mg/kg ) and naltrexone ( 3.2 and 5.6 mg/kg ) significantly reduced total alcohol intake ( g/kg ).
R	Naltrexone ( 5.6 mg/kg ) , but not baclofen , significantly reduced alcohol seeking.
C	Initiation of baclofen treatment ( or other alcohol use disorder treatments ) during abstinence or active drinking may be an important factor in influencing efficacy and appropriate dose selection.
B	Thrombolytic drugs to treat an acute ischaemic stroke reduce the risk of death or major disability.
B	The treatment is , however , also associated with an increased risk of potentially fatal intracranial bleeding.
B	This confronts the patient with the dilemma of whether or not to take a risk of a serious side effect in order to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome.
P	To explore acute stroke patients' perception of risk and willingness to accept risks associated with thrombolytic drug treatment.
M	Eleven patients who had been informed about thrombolytic drug treatment and had been through the process of deciding whether or not to participate in a thrombolytic drug trial went through repeated qualitative , semistructured interviews.
R	Many patients showed a limited perception of the risks connected with thrombolytic drug treatment.
R	Some perceived the risk as not relevant to them and were reluctant to accept that treatment could cause harm.
R	Others seemed to be aware that treatment would mean exposure to risk.
R	The patients' willingness to take a risk also varied substantially.
R	Several statements revealed ambiguity and confusion about being involved in a decision about treatment.
R	The patients' reasoning about risk was put into the context of their health-related experiences and life histories.
R	Several patients wanted the doctor to be responsible for the decisions.
C	Acute stroke patients' difficulties in perceiving and processing information about risk may reduce their ability to be involved in clinical decisions where risks are involved.
B	A national survey of family physicians working in the National Health Service ( NHS ) of England in 2001 revealed that 1/10 under 50 years of age were intending to leave direct patient care within 5 years , and that the principal predictor of their intention to leave was job satisfaction.
B	Our research addressed two questions.
B	First , does a family physician's stated intention to leave their job predict whether or not they actually do leave?
B	Second , to what extent does job satisfaction predict actually leaving?
M	Secondary data analysis was performed on 1174 family physicians aged 50 years and under , who responded to the aforementioned survey.
M	Using data from the annual census of physicians in the NHS , we determined which physicians actually left family practice during the next 5 years.
R	Of the 1174 family physicians studied , 194 ( 16.5% ) had left direct patient care within 5 years.
R	Multivariate regression showed that job satisfaction predicted a physician's intention to leave direct patient care and that intention to leave predicted actually leaving.
R	Logically , job satisfaction should then have predicted actual leaving.
R	Our findings , however , suggest that this is only partly true.
C	Although higher levels of job 'dissatisfaction' were associated with an increased likelihood of leaving , higher levels of job 'satisfaction' did not prevent leaving.
B	Types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus complicate pregnancies and threaten the health of women of reproductive age and their children.
B	Among older adults , diabetes morbidity disproportionately burdens racial/ethnic minorities , but diabetes emergence among younger adults has not been as well characterized.
B	The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of diagnosed diabetes , undiagnosed diabetes , suboptimal preconception glycemic control , and prediabetes among women of reproductive age across racial/ethnic backgrounds.
M	We analyzed data collected in 2007-2008 from 6774 nonpregnant women , ages 24-32 , in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health ( Add Health ).
M	Prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were identified by fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) and diagnosed diabetes by self-report or antihyperglycemic medication use.
M	We used multinomial regression models to predict prediabetes or diabetes versus normoglycemia.
M	Within women with diabetes , we used logistic regression to predict those being undiagnosed and having suboptimal preconception glycemic control based on A1C.
R	The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 6.8% , of which 45.3% was undiagnosed.
R	Diabetes prevalence varied by race/ethnicity ( p<0.001 ): 15.0% of non-Hispanic black women ( 75.6% undiagnosed ) , 7.5% of Hispanic women ( 48.1% undiagnosed ) , 4.8% of non-Hispanic white women ( 22.8% undiagnosed ) , and 4.5% of Asian women ( 11.4% undiagnosed ).
R	The prevalence of prediabetes was highest in non-Hispanic black ( 38.5% ) , followed by Hispanic ( 27.8% ) , Asian ( 25.1% ) , Native American ( 20.3% ) , and non-Hispanic white ( 16.6% ) women.
C	Racial/ethnic disparities exist among women of reproductive age with prediabetes and diabetes.
C	Meeting their healthcare needs requires addressing health inequities and coordination of diabetes management with reproductive health.
B	Emotional reactions toward people with disorders are an important component of stigma process.
B	In this study , emotional reactions of the German public toward people with dementia were analyzed.
M	Analyses are based on a national mail survey conducted in 2012.
M	Sample consists of persons aged 18 to 79 years living in private households in Germany.
M	In all 1 ,795 persons filled out the questionnaire , reflecting a response rate of 78%.
M	Respondents were asked about their emotional reactions and beliefs about dementia.
R	A vast majority of the respondents expressed pro-social reactions , i.e. they felt pity , sympathy , and the need to help a person with dementia.
R	Dementia patients rarely evoked anger ( 10% or less ).
R	Between 25% and 50% of the population showed reactions indicating fear.
R	Respondents who had contacts with a person having dementia or had cared for a dementia patient tended to show less negative reactions ( fear , anger ) and more pro-social reactions.
R	Respondents who showed pronounced fearful reactions were less likely to believe that dementia patients had a high quality of life , were less willing to care for a family member with dementia at home , and were more skeptical about early detection of dementia.
R	Comparison with the results of another study suggests that fearful reactions toward persons with dementia are much more pronounced than in the case of depression , and less pronounced than in the case of schizophrenia.
C	Fearful reactions toward people with dementia are quite common in the German general public.
C	To reduce fear , educational programs and contact-based approaches should be considered.
P	This study synthesised the findings of three separate consensus processes exploring the perspectives of key stakeholder groups about important aphasia treatment outcomes.
P	This process was conducted to generate recommendations for outcome domains to be included in a core outcome set for aphasia treatment trials.
M	International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health codes were examined to identify where the groups of: ( 1 ) people with aphasia , ( 2 ) family members , ( 3 ) aphasia researchers , and ( 4 ) aphasia clinicians/managers , demonstrated congruence in their perspectives regarding important treatment outcomes.
M	Codes were contextualized using qualitative data.
R	Congruence across three or more stakeholder groups was evident for ICF chapters: Mental functions ; Communication ; and Services , systems , and policies.
R	Quality of life was explicitly identified by clinicians/managers and researchers , while people with aphasia and their families identified outcomes known to be determinants of quality of life.
C	Core aphasia outcomes include: language , emotional wellbeing , communication , patient-reported satisfaction with treatment and impact of treatment , and quality of life.
C	International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health coding can be used to compare stakeholder perspectives and identify domains for core outcome sets.
C	Pairing coding with qualitative data may ensure important nuances of meaning are retained.
B	The differential diagnosis of non-accidental injury during childhood includes medical conditions that predispose to skeletal fragility.
B	Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) has been proposed as one such condition despite little objective evidence in the medical literature.
P	To investigate if EDS causes increased bone fragility during infancy and childhood.
M	Residents of an 8-county region in southern Minnesota using the Rochester Epidemiology Project ( REP ) medical records-linkage system.
M	This retrospective , population-based , case-control study identified subjects with EDS from 1976 to 2015 who had complete records for at least their first year of life.
M	Validity of diagnosis was ascertained using the 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes.
M	Records were reviewed for fracture diagnoses that were characterized by age , location , type and mechanism.
R	Of 219 potential cases , 21 had complete records for the first year of life and sufficient evidence in the medical record to support an EDS diagnosis.
R	Of these 21 , there were 14 hy-permobile , 2 classical , 4 vascular , and 1 arthrochalasia EDS subtypes.
R	11 of 21 EDS cases ( 52.4% ) and 15 of 63 controls ( 23.8% ) had one or more fractures during childhood.
R	No fractures were identified in the first year of life.
R	Comparing cases to controls , EDS was associated with having any fractures during childhood with an odds ratio of 3.4 ( 95% CI: 1.20-9.66 ).
C	We found no evidence that infants with common forms of EDS are predisposed to more frequent fractures.
C	Ambulatory subjects with these EDS subtypes may have a higher incidence of fractures during childhood.
P	The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires child welfare agencies to have provisions in place to refer young children to early intervention services , yet the socioemotional health needs of children are often challenging to recognize and treat effectively.
P	This study reviews the substantive and psychometric properties of screening instruments designed for children ages 10 and younger.
M	Major social science databases , websites of national organizations , and the Mental Measurements Yearbook were used to identify instruments for review.
R	Twenty-four instruments met review criteria , and eight show above-average measurement properties and testing , tap children's strengths and concerns , and have evidence of validity with families similar to child welfare-involved families.
C	It is important to effectively screen for children showing concerns in early childhood , so that treatment and prevention can be prioritized.
C	This study indicated several tools with adequate testing and with emerging evidence and applicability to child welfare.
B	Unsafe injection practices play a major role in elevated rates of morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs ( IDU ).
B	There is growing interest in the direct involvement of IDU in interventions that seek to address unsafe injecting.
B	This study describes a drug user-led safer injecting education campaign , and explores facilitators' experiences delivering educational workshops.
M	We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 8 members of the Injection Support ( IS ) Team who developed and facilitated a series of safer injecting education workshops.
M	Interviews explored facilitator's perceptions of the workshops , experiences being a facilitator , and perspectives on the educational campaign.
M	Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was conducted.
R	IS Team facilitators described how the workshop's structure and content enabled effective communication of information about safer injecting practices , while targeting the unsafe practices of workshop participants.
R	Facilitators' identity as IDU enhanced their ability to relate to workshop participants and communicate educational messages in language accessible to workshop participants.
R	Facilitators reported gaining knowledge and skills from their involvement in the campaign , as well as positive feelings about themselves from the realization that they were helping people to protect their health.
R	Overall , facilitators felt that this campaign provided IDU with valuable information , although facilitators also critiqued the campaign and suggested improvements for future efforts.
C	This study demonstrates the feasibility of involving IDU in educational initiatives targeting unsafe injecting.
C	Findings illustrate how IDU involvement in prevention activities improves relevance and cultural appropriateness of interventions while providing individual , social , and professional benefits to those IDU delivering education.
B	The purpose of this study was to determine the level of heat stress to construction workers using Thermal Work Limit ( TWL ) and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature ( WBGT ) indices and by measuring Urine Specific Gravity ( USG ) among construction workers in Iran and comparing the appropriateness of these indices for measuring heat stress in Iran climate.
M	This comparative and experimental study was conducted during September 2012 in Baghe Ketabe Tehran , one of the large size construction sites in Tehran City , Iran.
M	Sixty participants were randomly selected in two groups ( exposed to sun and non-exposed ) among the construction workers in a construction campus with similar work type , climate and diet.
M	TWL and WBGT and USG were measured in two consequent days and at the beginning , mid and end of the work shift , for both groups.
R	The mean WBGT index was 22.6 +/- 0.9 degrees C for control group and 27.5 +/- 1.2 degrees C for exposure group , the mean TWL index measure was 215.8 +/- 5.2 W/m( 2 ) for control group and 144 +/- 9.8 W/m( 2 ) for exposure group and the mean USG was 1.0213 +/- 0.0054 in control group and 1.026 +/- 0.005 in exposure group.
R	There was a significant difference in TWL , WBGT and USG between exposed and non-exposed group ( P<0.01 ).
C	workers were at an allowed level of heat stress.
C	TWL , WBGT and USG measures were significantly correlated ; however as TWL level enabled classification based on required intervention , it had some merit over WBGT index.
B	Little research exists on social media ( e.g. , Facebook , Twitter , etc. ) use among individuals with serious mental illnesses ( SMI ).
B	One particular question of interest is the extent to which online social media use is associated with these individuals' community participation , civic engagement and psychosocial outcomes.
M	Two-hundred and thirty-two individuals with SMI receiving services at 18 mental health organizations throughout the continental U.S. completed questionnaires on their community participation , civic engagement , quality of life , loneliness , and psychiatric symptoms.
M	They were also asked which social media sites they used ; the duration , frequency and importance of , and reasons for , social media use ; and the number of contacts they had on social media.
R	Approximately a third of the sample reported having at least one social media account.
R	Greater frequency , intensity and longevity of social media were associated with higher levels of community participation , and greater intensity of social media use was positively associated with civic engagement.
R	For instance , those who used social media at least 30 min a day had 16.4 more days of participation and voting rates that were higher by 17.4%.
R	Social media use was not found to be significantly associated with loneliness , psychiatric symptoms or quality of life.
C	Greater social media use appears to be associated with greater community engagement without negative repercussions on loneliness , symptoms , or quality of life.
C	Interventions that support social media use among individuals with SMI could have important community integration benefits.

B	Reliable measurements of infants obtained from routine clinical practice are scarce.
P	To investigate the reliability of anthropometric measurements collected in routine clinical practice at primary care hospitals in Chongqing , PR China.
M	The convenience sample comprised measurements from 739 infants aged <36 months.
M	Using typical methods , child healthcare clinicians ( CHCCs ) measured four variables ( recumbent and crown-rump lengths and head and chest circumferences ) ; child healthcare nurses ( CHCNs ) performed re-measurement using standardized anthropometric techniques.
M	Intra- and inter-observer measurement reliability were assessed mainly using technical error of measurement ( TEM ) , mean absolute difference ( MAD ) and coefficient of reliability ( R ).
R	Intra-observer MADs of the four measurements were significantly smaller among CHCNs than among CHCCs ( p<0.05 ).
R	The inter-observer TEMs of recumbent length and head circumference measurements were 0.58-0.68 and 0.38-0.48 cm , MADs were 0.60-0.71 and 0.40-0.51 cm and Rs were 0.968-0.995 and 0.937-0.971.
R	Crown-rump length TEMs and MADs were 0.77-0.83 and 0.81-0.87 cm and Rs were 0.896-0.961.
R	Chest circumference TEMs and MADs were >1.00 cm and Rs were <0.90.
C	Recumbent length and head circumference measurements were fair.
C	Crown-rump length and chest circumference measurements were less reliable.
B	Adults with intellectual disability are more likely to experience a range of physical and mental health problems in comparison to the general population.
B	However with access to appropriate health care and promotion , many of these health problems can be prevented.
P	To explore the perspectives of stakeholders of a health promotion program established for adults with intellectual disability.
M	Semi- structured interviews were conducted with 12 stakeholders of a health promotion program.
M	Stakeholders included adults with intellectual disability ( n = 6 ) , their support persons ( n = 4 ) and program presenters ( n = 2 ).
M	Adults with intellectual disability included three males and three females with a mean age of 45.5 years ( range 37-51 years ).
M	Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim.
M	Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.
R	Four main themes emerged from the data.
R	The first theme highlights the positive feedback all stakeholders , especially adults with intellectual disability , had for the program and the second focuses on suggestions for changes to improve it.
R	The third and final themes explore how having input from adults with intellectual disability and their support persons , who have a unique understanding of their needs , could be better incorporated into the development of the program.
C	This health promotion program has been well received by people with intellectual disability when incorporated into their weekly social club meetings With encouragement and training , people with intellectual disability and their support workers could be more involved in the development of the program to ensure it is relevant to their needs.

P	Antimicrobial wound dressings are becoming more popular and are routinely used in the treatment of chronic and problematic wounds.
P	Despite the ever-growing number and types of these antimicrobial products , many practitioners often do not report significant clinical differences between various common antimicrobial wound dressings despite wide variations in cost.
P	Although these dressings use different active ingredients or different presentations of a particular active ingredient , all attempt to protect the wound from bacterial colonization and promote wound repair.
P	With so many topical antimicrobial dressings to choose from in the clinical setting ( many having already fallen into disfavor due to their cytotoxic characteristics ) it was of prime interest to determine if there was a substantial difference between some of the more commonly used antimicrobial dressings , with silver versus an antimicrobial wound dressing using Oakin ( oak extract [Amerx Health Care Corporation , Clearwater , Florida] ) as the active ingredient.
M	This article compares the antimicrobial efficacy of 4 commonly used wound dressings in vitro , utilizing a corrected zone of inhibition test followed by a cost analysis.
R	In vitro testing demonstrated that there were no substantial differences in the corrected zone of inhibition measurements between the silver wound dressings and the less expensive Oakin-impregnated gauze dressing.
C	Despite obvious limitations of this study , these results suggest that the biggest differences between many antimicrobial dressings on the market may be more in cost than in antimicrobial efficacy.
C	The differences in cost are due to variances in cost per application and frequency of applications per week.

P	The purpose of this study was to construct and test a structural equation model for pressure ulcer prevention action by clinical nurses.
P	The Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior were used as the basis for the study.
M	A structured questionnaire was completed by 251 clinical nurses to analyze the relationships between concepts of perceived benefits , perceived barriers , attitude , subjective norm , perceived control , intention to perform action and behavior.
M	SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0 programs were used to analyze the efficiency of the hypothesized model and calculate the direct and indirect effects of factors affecting pressure ulcer prevention action among clinical nurses.
R	The model fitness statistics of the hypothetical model fitted to the recommended levels.
R	Attitude , subjective norm and perceived control on pressure ulcer prevention action explained 64.2% for intention to perform prevention action.
C	The major findings of this study indicate that it is essential to recognize improvement in positive attitude for pressure ulcer prevention action and a need for systematic education programs to increase perceived control for prevention action.
B	This study examined the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness , heart rate recovery , and physical activity on working memory in breast cancer survivors and age-matched controls.
M	Using a case-control design , 32 women who had received a breast cancer diagnosis and completed primary treatment within the past 36-months ( 11 radiation only ; 21 chemotherapy ) and 30 age-matched women with no previous cancer diagnosis completed a n-back continuous performance task commonly used as an assessment of working memory.
M	In addition , cardiorespiratory fitness and heart rate recovery were measured during a submaximal graded exercise test and physical activity was measured using 7-days of accelerometer monitoring.
R	Breast cancer survivors who had received chemotherapy had poorer heart rate recovery ( p=.010 ) and engaged in less physical activity than women who had received radiation only ( p=.004 ) or non-cancer controls ( p=.029 ).
R	Cancer treatment ( radiation ; chemotherapy ) predicted differences in reaction times on the 1-back working memory task ( p=.029 ).
R	However , more rapid heart rate recovery predicted shorter reaction times on the 1-back task in the age-matched control group ( p=.002 ).
R	All participants with greater cardiorespiratory fitness displayed greater accuracy independent of disease status on the 1-back task ( p=.017 ).
R	No significant group differences in reaction times were observed for 2-back target trials between breast cancer survivors and controls.
R	However , greater total physical activity predicted shorter reaction times in breast cancer survivors ( radiation , chemotherapy ) on the 2-back task ( p=.014 ).
R	In addition , all participants who exhibited more rapid heart rate recovery demonstrated better greater accuracy regardless of disease status ( p=.013 ).
C	These findings support differences in physical activty participation , heart rate recovery , and 1- and 2-back working memory reaction times between breast cancer survivors and age-matched controls.
C	Greater cardiorespiratory fitness , heart rate recovery , and physical activity were positively associated with better working memory performance across conditions.
B	Electronic theses and dissertations ( ETDs ) are a valuable resource for nurse scholars worldwide.
B	ETDs and digital libraries offer the potential to radically change the nature and scope of the way in which doctoral research results are presented , disseminated and used.
B	An exploratory study was undertaken to better understand ETD usage and to address areas where there is a need and an opportunity for educational enhancement.
P	The primary objective was to gain an initial understanding of the knowledge and use of ETDs and digital libraries by faculty , graduate students and alumni of graduate programs at schools of nursing.
M	A descriptive online survey design was used.
M	Purposeful sampling of specific schools of nursing was used to identify institutional participants in Australia , New Zealand , the UK and the US.
M	A total of 209 participants completed the online questionnaire.
R	Only 44% of participants reported knowing how to access ETDs in their institutions' digital libraries and only 18% reported knowing how to do so through a national or international digital library.
R	Only 27% had cited an ETD in a publication.
R	The underuse of ETDs was found to be attributable to specific issues rather than general reluctance to use online resources.
C	This is the first international study that has explored awareness and use of ETDs , and ETD digital libraries , with a focus on nursing and has set the stage for future research and development in this field.
C	Results show that most nursing scholars do not use ETDs to their fullest potential.
B	Exercise behavior in depressive patients was analyzed using the HealthAction Process Approach.
P	To detect subtypes of depressive patients with different deficits and strengths regarding intention formation ( motivation ) and intention implementation ( volition ).
M	Sixty-two depressive patients received-self-report questionnaires with exercise related variables.
M	Patient types were identified using cluster analysis.
R	There were four clusters: The first cluster showed no intention to exercise ( non-intender ) ; the second cluster showed medium intention ( medium-intender ).
R	The third cluster had high intention but suffered from volitional deficits ( high-intender ).
R	The fourth cluster reported high intention and succeeded in intention implementation ( actor ).
C	Depressive patients can be classified into four subtypes regarding exercise.
C	The cluster profiles suggest subtype-specific interventions to increase exercise.
B	Since the situation-specific theory of heart failure ( HF ) self-care was published in 2008 , we have learned much about how and why patients with HF take care of themselves.
B	This knowledge was used to revise and update the theory.
P	The purpose of this article was to describe the revised , updated situation-specific theory of HF self-care.
R	Three major revisions were made to the existing theory: ( 1 ) a new theoretical concept reflecting the process of symptom perception was added ; ( 2 ) each self-care process now involves both autonomous and consultative elements ; and ( 3 ) a closer link between the self-care processes and the naturalistic decision-making process is described.
R	In the revised theory , HF self-care is defined as a naturalistic decision-making process with person , problem , and environmental factors that influence the everyday decisions made by patients and the self-care actions taken.
R	The first self-care process , maintenance , captures those behaviors typically referred to as treatment adherence.
R	The second self-care process , symptom perception , involves body listening , monitoring signs , as well as recognition , interpretation , and labeling of symptoms.
R	The third self-care process , management , is the response to symptoms when they occur.
R	A total of 5 assumptions and 8 testable propositions are specified in this revised theory.
C	Prior research illustrates that all 3 self-care processes ( ie , maintenance , symptom perception , and management ) are integral to self-care.
C	Further research is greatly needed to identify how best to help patients become experts in HF self-care.
C	the results of the present study suggest a positive relation between vodka sale and myocardial infarction mortality rate at aggregate level and support the hypothesis that binge drinking of strong spirits is a risk factor of myocardial infarction at the individual level.
C	Thus , from a public policy point of view , the outcome of this study suggests that cardiovascular-related mortality prevention programs should put more focus on addressing alcohol consumption structure.
B	Previous literature has shown a divergence by age in the relationship between socioeconomic status ( SES ) and substance use: adolescents with low SES are more likely to engage in substance use , as are adults with high SES.
B	However , there is growing evidence that adolescents with high SES are also at high risk for substance abuse.
B	The objective of this study is to examine this relationship longitudinally , that is , whether wealthier adolescents are more likely than those with lower SES to engage in substance use in early adulthood.
M	The study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health ( AddHealth ) , a longitudinal , nationally-representative survey of secondary school students in the United States.
M	Logistic regression models were analyzed examining the relationship between adolescent SES ( measured by parental education and income ) and substance use in adulthood , controlling for substance use in adolescence and other covariates.
R	Higher parental education is associated with higher rates of binge drinking , marijuana and cocaine use in early adulthood.
R	Higher parental income is associated with higher rates of binge drinking and marijuana use.
R	No statistically significant results are found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug use.
R	Results are not sensitive to the inclusion of college attendance by young adulthood as a sensitivity analysis.
R	However , when stratifying by race , results are consistent for white non-Hispanics , but no statistically significant results are found for non-whites.
R	This may be a reflection of the smaller sample size of non-whites , but may also reflect that these trends are driven primarily by white non-Hispanics.
C	Previous research shows numerous problems associated with substance use in young adults , including problems in school , decreased employment , increases in convictions of driving under the influence ( DUI ) and accidental deaths.
C	Much of the previous literature is focused on lower SES populations.
C	Therefore , it is possible that teachers , parents and school administrators in wealthier schools may not perceive as great to address substance abuse treatment in their schools.
C	This study can inform teachers , parents , school administrators and program officials of the need for addressing drug abuse prevention activities to this population of students.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the Nanta-program on psychiatric symptoms , interpersonal relationships , and quality of life ( QoL ) in forensic inpatients with schizophrenia ( SPR ).
M	A quasi-experimental study employing a nonequivalent control group and pre-posttest design was conducted.
M	Participants were 38 forensic inpatients with SPR from South Korea ( experimental group = 18 , control group = 20 ).
M	The intervention was conducted in 12 sessions over 12 weeks , taking 90 min per session.
M	Data were analyzed using chi( 2 )-test and t-test with SPSS 22.0 program.
R	The experimental group showed significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms ( t = -2.73 , p =.010 ) and slight improvement in interpersonal relationships ( t = 2.23 , p =.0.34 ) after 12 weeks of group music therapy.
R	There was no significant difference in QoL change between the two groups.
C	These findings indicate that the Nanta-program is an effective intervention program for improving psychiatric symptoms and interpersonal relationships of prisoners with schizophrenia.

B	Pregnant women and newborns are at increased risk of complications from seasonal flu.
B	Vaccination is effective and safe but there is low adherence in pregnant women.
P	to identify the reasons that lead pregnant women not to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.
M	Scoping Review in which we used as search terms.
M	DeCS "Pregnant Women" , "Vaccines against Influenza".
M	MeSH "Pregnant Women" , "Influenza Vaccines" , united by AND.
M	Databases: Medline , VHL , Scielo , CUIDEN.
M	The PRISMA model and the Joanna Briggs Institute tool were used to sort the search and synthesize the results.
M	Motives were identified in each study and ordered according to frequency of appearance.
R	16 studies were found that identify 15 reasons for not being vaccinated.
R	The most frequent were: Concern about side effects and / or vaccine safety and lack of information / recommendation from health professionals.
C	The decision of not to be vaccinated seems to be multifactorial.
C	In some cases , health professionals can play a fundamental role in adherence.
C	These results could be useful for future research.
P	The 78 million baby boomers have driven up housing demand and prices for three decades since beginning to buy homes in 1970 and continuing up the housing ladder.
P	What will happen when boomers begin to sell off their high-priced homes to relatively smaller and less-advantaged generations?
P	This article presents a long-run projection of annual home buying and selling by age groups in the 50 states and considers implications for communities of the anticipated downturn in demand.
M	We propose a method for estimating average annual age-specific buying and selling rates , weighting these by population projections to identify states whose growing proportions of seniors may cause an excess of home selling sooner than others.
M	We also analyze the likely supplier responses to diminished demand , and recommend strategies for local planners.
C	Sellers of existing homes provide 85% of the annual supply of homes sold , and home sales are driven by the aging of the population since seniors are net home sellers.
C	The ratio of seniors to working-age residents will increase by 67% over the next two decades ; thus we anticipate the end of a generational housing bubble.
C	We also find that younger generations face an affordability barrier created by the recent housing price boom.
C	With proper foresight , planners could mitigate what otherwise could be significant consequences of these projections.
C	Takeaway for practice: The retirement of the baby boomers could signal the end of the postwar era for planning , and reverse several longstanding trends , leading decline to exceed gentrification , demand for low-density housing to diminish , and new emphasis on compact development.
C	Such developments call planners to undertake new activities , including actively marketing to retain elderly residents and cultivating new immigrant residents to replace them.
B	Mental illness has been widely cited as a driver of costs in the criminal justice system.
P	The objective of this paper is to estimate the additional mental health service costs incurred within the criminal justice system that are incurred because of people with mental illnesses who go through the system.
P	Our focus is on costs in Alberta.
M	We set up a model of the flow of all persons through the criminal justice system , including police , court , and corrections components , and for mental health diversion , review , and forensic services.
M	We estimate the transitional probabilities and costs that accrue as persons who have been charged move through the system.
M	Costs are estimated for the Alberta criminal justice system as a whole , and for the mental illness component.
R	Public expenditures for each person diverted or charged in Alberta in the criminal justice system , including mental health costs , were $16 ,138.
R	The 95% range of this estimate was from $14 ,530 to $19 ,580.
R	Of these costs , 87% were for criminal justice services and 13% were for mental illness-related services.
R	Hospitalization for people with mental illness who were reviewed represented the greatest additional cost associated with mental illnesses.
C	Treatment costs stemming from mental illnesses directly add about 13% onto those in the criminal justice system.

B	The current investigation is the first large-scale population-based study from France that documents the association between excess body weight and common psychiatric disorders , and examines the influence of gender on the association between excess body weight and these disorders.
B	A recent plan has been implemented in France to treat the rising rate of those who are overweight or obese , and we seek to demonstrate whether integrated treatment of excess weight and psychiatric conditions appears as indicated.
M	Data were drawn from a cross-sectional general population survey of 17 ,237 adults.
M	Past-year psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form.
M	Body mass index was used to determine excess weight status.
R	Overall , 3.7% of the sample were underweight , 57% were normal weight , 28% were overweight ( 35% of men , 22% of women ) , and 11% were obese ( 11% of men , 11% of women ).
R	Being overweight was more common in men than women , although obesity did not differ by gender.
R	Sociodemographic variables significantly associated with weight status included , age , marital status , education , employment status , income level , and population density.
R	Adjusting for these variables , being overweight was associated with major depression and other disorders among women and inversely associated with drug abuse and dependence among men.
R	Obesity was associated with major depression , panic disorder , agoraphobia , social phobia , specific phobia , and obsessive-compulsive disorder among women.
R	Only generalized anxiety was associated with obesity among men.
C	Past year , mental disorders were more likely associated with being overweight or obese among women as compared with men.
C	The prevalence of these co-occurring psychiatric disorders in the context of the rising rate of obesity in France indicates a clear need for psychiatric assessment and treatment in caring for those with excess weight , especially women.
C	Preliminary reports suggest this need is unmet within the otherwise progressive move in France to assist those struggling with excess weight.
P	To analyze the effects that an emotional intelligence ( EI ) educational program based on the EI ability model had on adolescent mental health immediately and 6 months after completion of the training.
M	A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design with a treatment and a control group was used ; 479 Spanish adolescents ( 47.4% male , mean age of 13 years ) were involved in the study.
M	Adolescents were recruited through several schools in three Spanish cities.
M	The 2-year training program involved 24 sessions lasting 1 hour each , conducted 'weekly during 6 months of 2009 and 2010.
M	Data on psychological adjustment , mental health , and negative affect were collected at baseline , at the end of the training program , and 6 months later.
M	Data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance.
R	Students who participated in the EI educational program reported fewer clinical symptoms compared with students in the control group , and these differences persisted 6 months after the conclusion of the program.
C	These results suggest that EI programs created to develop skills in perceiving , facilitating , understanding , and managing emotions can be effective at promoting mental health in adolescents.

B	In the new era of value-based payment models and pay for performance , hospitals are in search of the silver bullet strategy or bundle of strategies capable of improving their performance on quality measures.
P	To determine whether there is an association between adoption of hospital-based care coordination strategies and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services overall hospital quality ( star ) ratings and readmission rates.
M	We used survey data from the American Hospital Association ( AHA ) and categorized respondents by the number of care coordination strategies that they reported having widely implemented.
M	We used multiple logistic regression models to examine the association between the number of strategies and hospital overall rating performance and disease-specific 30-day excess readmission ratios , while controlling for hospital and county characteristics and state-fixed effects.
M	A total of 710 general acute care noncritical access hospitals that received star ratings and responded to the 2015 AHA Care Systems and Payment Survey.
M	Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services overall hospital ratings , 30-day excess readmission ratios.
R	As compared with hospitals with 0-2 strategies , hospitals with 3 to 4 strategies ( P=0.007 ) , 5-7 strategies ( P=0.002 ) , or 8-12 strategies ( P=0.002 ) had approximately 2.5x the odds of receiving a top rating ( 4 or 5 stars ).
R	Care coordination strategies were positively associated with lower 30-day readmission ratios for patients with chronic medical conditions , but not for surgical patients.
R	Medication reconciliation , visit summaries , outreach after discharge , discharge care plans , and disease management programs were each individually associated with top ratings.
C	Care coordination strategies are associated with high overall hospital ratings.
B	The 2012 National Survey of Peer-Run Organizations is one of the first to survey a nationally representative sample of mental health peer-run organizations , non-profit venues for support and advocacy which are defined by people with psychiatric histories being in positions of authority and control.
P	This paper describes data collection methods and demonstrates how participatory strategies to involve people with psychiatric histories intersected with Internet research to achieve study aims.
M	People with psychiatric histories were involved in designing and implementing a web-based survey to collect data on peer-run organizations' operations and views on national policy.
M	Participatory approaches were used throughout design , data collection analysis , and dissemination.
C	The extensive involvement of people with psychiatric histories in project design and implementation were important strategies that contributed to this study's success.
B	Psychological stress associated with caregiving is thought to underlie the high incidence of hypertension , ischemic heart disease , and mortality , as well as reduced immune function , among caregivers of dementia patients.
B	Here , we examined the effects of periodic leisure activities performed by caregivers of dementia patients with care recipients at home on perceived care burden and levels of stress hormones.
M	Participants were 42 caregivers aged >= 65 years of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia.
M	They were randomly assigned to intervention and non-intervention groups.
M	The intervention group underwent a leisure activity program ( 30 min/3 times/week for 24 weeks ) with the care recipient , and the control group underwent normal care activities.
R	The Zarit Burden Interview ( ZBI ) score , a subjective indicator of care burden , significantly decreased after intervention in the intervention group ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas no difference was observed in the control group.
R	No significant changes were observed in adrenaline , noradrenaline , dopamine , and cortisol levels in both groups.
C	The lack of changes in stress hormone levels despite a decrease in subjective care burden in the intervention group might be explained by the effects of the chosen leisure activity on the neuroendocrine system.
C	Our findings suggest that periodic leisure activities can reduce perceived care burden among caregivers of dementia patients.
C	However , in order to evaluate accurately the effects of leisure activities of the present study , long-term follow-up of both caregivers and care recipients is necessary.
C	The Nagoya University Department of Medicine Ethics Committee Clinical Trials Registry Number is 1290.
P	To describe and assess currently used area-based measures of deprivation in Brazil for health research , to the purpose of informing the development of a future small area deprivation index.
M	We searched five electronic databases and seven websites of Brazilian research institutions and governmental agencies.
M	Inclusion criteria were: studies proposing measures of deprivation for small areas ( i.e. , finer geography than country-level ) in Brazil , published in English , Portuguese or Spanish.
M	After data-extraction , results were tabulated according to the area level the deprivation measure was created for and to the dimensions of deprivation or poverty included in the measures.
M	A narrative synthesis approach was used to summarize the measures available , highlighting their utility for public health research.
R	A total of 7 ,199 records were retrieved , 126 full-text articles were assessed after inclusion criteria and a final list of 30 articles was selected.
R	No small-area deprivation measures that have been applied to the whole of Brazil were found.
R	Existing measures were mainly used to study infectious and parasitic diseases.
R	Few studies used the measures to assess inequalities in mortality and no studies used the deprivation measure to evaluate the impact of social programs.
C	No up-to-date small area-based deprivation measure in Brazil covers the whole country.
C	There is a need to develop such an index for Brazil to measure and monitor inequalities in health and mortality , particularly to assess progress in Brazil against the Sustainable Development Goal targets for different health outcomes , showing progress by socioeconomic groups.

B	Despite widespread cultural vilification , lactation-pregnancy overlap remains common.
B	Its actual adverse effects remain uncertain.
P	This study compared rates of success in reaching full-term delivery and newborn birth weights between two groups of multiparous pregnant women: those who breastfed during pregnancy and those who did not.
M	This was a comparative study conducted over 9 months , which examined two groups of women in the maternity units of two hospitals in Birjand , Iran.
M	The first group comprised 80 women who breast-fed for 30 days or more during pregnancy ; the second group comprised 240 women who did not.
M	The two groups had similar distributions in terms of maternal age , parity , medical/midwifery problems , and nutritional changes during pregnancy.
M	Two trained nurses used a self-developed questionnaire to collect data.
R	Results found no significant difference in full-term or non-full-term births rates and mean newborn birth weight between the two groups.
R	We further found no significant difference between full-term or non-full-term births and mean newborn birth weight for those who continued and discontinued breastfeeding during pregnancy in the overlap group.
C	Results suggest that breastfeeding during normal pregnancy does not increase chance of untoward maternal and newborn outcomes.
C	Nurses and midwives should give expectant mothers appropriate evidence-based guidance and focus attention on promoting proper nutritional intake based on lactation status during pregnancy.
P	The goal of this study was to determine the impact of age , gender , and race on the prevalence and severity of hearing loss in elder adults , aged 72-96 years , after accounting for income , education , smoking , and clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease.
M	Air-conduction thresholds for standard and extended high-frequency pure-tones were obtained from a cohort of 548 ( out of 717 ) elderly adults ( ages 72-96 years ) who were recruited during the Year 11 clinical visit ( 1999-2000 ) of the Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) at the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania site.
M	Participant smoking , income , education , and cardiovascular disease histories were obtained from the CHS database and were included as factors.
R	Hearing loss was more common and more severe for the participants in their 80s than for those in their 70s-the men more than the women and the White participants more than the Black participants.
R	The inclusion of education , income , smoking , and cardiovascular disease ( clinical and subclinical ) histories as factors did not substantively impact the overall results.
C	Although the data reported in this article were cross-sectional and a cohort phenomenon might have been operational , they suggested that hearing loss is more substantive in the 8th than the 7th decade of life and that race and gender influence this decline in audition.
C	Given the high prevalence in the aging population and the differences across groups , there is a clear need to understand the nature and causes of hearing loss across various groups in order to improve prevention and develop appropriate interventions.
B	The self-identification of nursing students with the profession has been linked with a successful transition , from being a student to being a professional nurse.
B	Although there is no empirical evidence , there are suggestions that students with high professional identity are more likely to persist and complete their studies in their chosen profession.
P	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a professional identity scale and to determine the relationship between professional identity and student retention in a large group of first year nursing students.
M	A survey design was used to examine the professional identity of first year nursing students , as measured by the Macleod Clark Professional Identity Scale ( MCPIS-9 ).
M	Baseline data obtained from the initial surveys were then compared with student drop-out rates 12 months later.
R	Exploratory factor analysis of the MCPIS-9 yielded a one-component solution , accounting for 433% of the variance.
R	All 9 items loaded highly on one component , ranging from 0.50 to 0.79.
R	Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the MCPIS-9 was 0.83 and corrected item-total correlation values all scored well above the 0.3 cutoff.
R	Students who: were females , had previous nursing-related vocational training , reported nursing as their first choice , or engaged in nursing-related paid work , had statistically significant higher professional identity scores.
R	Using logistic regression analysis , students with high professional identity scores at baseline were more likely to be still enrolled in the nursing program at 12 months , controlling for gender , language spoken at home and engagement in nursing-related employment.
R	These results support the psychometric properties of the MCPIS-9.
C	Professional identity has a direct relationship with student retention in the nursing program.
C	It is important to adequately measure professional identity in nursing students for the purpose of monitoring and identifying students who are at risk of leaving nursing programs.

P	Physical activity ( PA ) has been consistently associated with improved self-esteem in breast cancer survivors.
P	However , this relationship is poorly understood.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine whether changes in PA and self-efficacy influenced changes in self-esteem in breast cancer survivors across 6 months.
P	Increases in PA were hypothesized to result in increases in self-efficacy , which were hypothesized to influence increases in physical self-worth ( PSW ) and global self-esteem.
M	Breast cancer survivors ( n = 370 ; M-age = 56.04 ) wore accelerometers to measure PA and completed measures of self-efficacy ( e.g. , exercise and barriers self-efficacy ) , PSW , and global self-esteem at baseline and 6 months.
R	The hypothesized model provided a good fit to the data ( chi( 2 ) = 67.56 , df = 26 , p < 0.001 ; comparative fit index ( CFI ) = 0.98 ; standardized root mean residual = 0.05 ).
R	Women with higher activity at baseline reported significantly higher levels of barrier ( beta = 0.29 ) and exercise ( beta = 0.23 ) self-efficacy.
R	In turn , more efficacious women reported significantly higher PSW ( beta = 0.26 , 0.16 ).
R	Finally , higher PSW was significantly associated with greater global self-esteem ( beta = 0.47 ).
R	Relationships were similar among changes in model constructs over 6 months.
R	After controlling for covariates , the hypothesized model provided an excellent fit to the data ( chi( 2 ) = 59.93 , df = 33 , p = 0.003 ; comparative fit index = 0.99 ; standardized root mean residual = 0.03 ).
C	Our findings provide support for the role played by PA and self-efficacy in positive self-esteem , a key component of well-being.
C	Highlighting successful PA mastery experiences is likely to enhance self-efficacy and improve self-esteem in this population.

B	Due to increases in HIV notifications in Queensland , a health promotion outreach project was developed with sex on premises venues ( SOPV ) in Brisbane.
M	A health promotion officer ( HPO ) promoted safer sex behaviours among SOPV patrons over 14 months , including providing information , counselling and skills to enhance safer sexual behaviours and providing referrals.
M	Surveys were introduced to facilitate discussions regarding HIV/sexually transmissible infections , testing and safer sex practices.
R	The project demonstrated feasibility within this highly sexualised environment , and was enhanced by careful monitoring and revising the procedure to improve patron/staff responses to the project.
R	The introduction of a survey instrument was a significant contributor to the project's effectiveness , providing opportunities for patrons to discuss a variety of key sexual health issues.
C	This initiative reflected effective partnering between the Health Department , a community HIV/lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender organisation and private industry.
C	Despite initial difficulties , the presence of a health worker within an SOPV was acceptable to patrons and allowed for brief interventions to be conducted.
C	This project was deemed effective for a limited time period and within certain constraints.
B	Although the Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense ( VA/DoD ) clinical guidelines for management of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) recommend against routine benzodiazepine use , little is known about the trends and clinical and prescription profiles of benzodiazepine use since these guidelines were released in 2004.
M	This retrospective study included 64 ,872 patients with a PTSD diagnosis received from care at facilities in VA Northwest Veterans Integrated Service Network ( VISN 20 ) during 2003-2010.
M	Annual prevalence of any use was defined as any prescription for benzodiazepines , and long-term use was defined as >90 days' supply , in a year.
M	Gender-specific logistic regressions were fit to estimate any and long-term benzodiazepine use , test for linear trends over 8-years and explore factors associated with trends.
R	The trend of age-adjusted benzodiazepine use over 8-years rose significantly from 25.0 to 26.8% among men and 31.2 to 38.8% among women.
R	Long-term use in men and women increased from 15.4 to 16.4% and 18.0 to 22.7% , respectively.
R	Comorbid psychiatric and alcohol use disorders ( AUD ) were associated with a greater increase in long-term use of benzodiazepines.
R	In 2010 , 61% of benzodiazepine users received >90 days' supply.
R	Among those prescribed benzodiazepines long-term , 11% had AUD and 47% were also prescribed opioids long-term.
C	Despite VA/DoD clinical guidelines recommending against routine use of benzodiazepines for PTSD , the adjusted prevalence of long-term use increased among men and women with PTSD in VISN 20.
C	Widespread concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids suggests risk management systems and research on the efficacy and safety of these medications are needed.

B	Implementation of collaborative Medication Review ( MR ) into routine care faces several barriers.
P	The study aim was to gain information on patient selection for a MR by general practitioners ( GPs ).
P	GP selection was compared to objective selection criteria on identifying patients , who would benefit from a MR the most.
P	A secondary objective of this study was to get insight into GPs perception on interprofessional collaboration with pharmacists.
M	GPs were interviewed for a qualitative study on expected outcomes of MR in former study patients.
M	They were asked to select patients , for whom they expected a major benefit from the MR. Results were compared to objective selection criteria , obtained from the WestGem study.
M	Further interviews were done on aspects of patient selection and perception of interprofessional collaboration , results were presented descriptively.
R	The study covered 6 GPs with 78 former study patients.
R	GPs would have chosen 45 out of the 78 patients ( 57.7% ) for a MR. According to changes in the Medication Appropriateness Index , 24 of these patients had a greater benefit from the MR. Patient selection by the number of prescribed drugs had reached a higher specificity at a cut-off of 9 drugs , compared to selection by the GP ( 67% vs. 61.5% ).
R	GPs mentioned medication safety , certain diseases , polymedication , multimorbidity as selection criteria.
R	Increasing quality of therapy and better insight into the patient's drug regimen was appreciated by the GPs as perceived personal advantage of the MR. GPs preferred to have a MR initiated by themselves , but appraised concise interprofessional collaboration with pharmacists.
C	Patient selection for MR should take objective parameters into account and combine them with subjective impressions.
C	GPs preferred the initiation of a MR by themselves but expressed a positive attitude towards collaboration with a pharmacist afterwards.
C	Recommendations should be relevant and concise.
P	Previous research has demonstrated that children weight the acoustic cues to many phonemic decisions differently than do adults and gradually shift those strategies as they gain language experience.
P	However , that research has focused on spectral and duration cues rather than on amplitude cues.
P	In the current study , the authors examined amplitude rise time ( ART ; an amplitude cue ) and formant rise time ( FRT ; a spectral cue ) in the /ba/-/wa/ manner contrast for adults and children , and related those speech decisions to outcomes of nonspeech discrimination tasks.
M	Twenty adults and 30 children ( ages 4-5 years ) labeled natural and synthetic speech stimuli manipulated to vary ARTs and FRTs , and discriminated nonspeech analogs that varied only by ART in an AX paradigm.
R	Three primary results were obtained.
R	First , listeners in both age groups based speech labeling judgments on FRT , not on ART.
R	Second , the fundamental frequency of the natural speech samples did not influence labeling judgments.
R	Third , discrimination performance for the nonspeech stimuli did not predict how listeners would perform with the speech stimuli.
C	Even though both adults and children are sensitive to ART , it was not weighted in phonemic judgments by these typical listeners.
B	Development of children with congenital visual impairment ( VI ) has been associated with vulnerable socio-communicative outcomes often bearing striking similarities to those of sighted children with autism.1 To date , very little is known about language and social communication in children with VI of normal intelligence.
M	We examined the presentation of language and social communication of 15 children with VI and normal-range verbal intelligence , age 6-12 years , using a standardised language assessment and parental reports of everyday social and communicative behaviours.
M	Their profiles were compared to those of typically developing sighted children of similar age and verbal ability.
R	Compared to their sighted peers , and relative to their own good and potentially superior structural language skills , children with VI showed significantly poorer use of language for social purposes.
R	Pragmatic language weaknesses were a part of a broader socio-communicative profile of difficulties , present in a substantial proportion of these children and consistent with the pattern found in sighted children with autism.
C	There are ongoing socio-communicative and pragmatic language difficulties in children with congenital VI at school age , despite their good intellectual abilities and advanced linguistic skills.
C	Further research is required to unpack the underlying causes and factors maintaining this vulnerability in such children.
B	Ecstasy use is prevalent among young people and often co-occurs with other drug use , but little is known about the past 12-month and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity and specific additional drug abuse among young adult ecstasy users in the general population.
B	To provide this information , we compared current ecstasy users to former users , other illicit drug users , and non-illicit drug users.
M	Data were gathered in a face-to-face survey of the United States conducted in the 2001-2002 ( NESARC ).
M	Participants were household and group quarters residents aged 18-29 years ( n=8666 ).
M	We measured current ecstasy use defined as any use in the past year ; former ecstasy use as use prior to the past year only ; other lifetime drug use included any drug other than ecstasy ; lifetime non-illicit drug use as no illicit drug use.
M	Associations were determined for nine other classes of illicit drugs , eight personality disorders , and seven mood and anxiety disorders.
R	Of current ecstasy users , 44% used >3 other classes of illicit drugs in the past year , compared to 1.6% of non-ecstasy drug users.
R	Current ecstasy use was associated with current anxiety ( OR=3.7 ) , specifically panic disorder ( OR=7.7 ) and specific phobia ( OR=4.1 ) , also alcohol abuse ( OR=21.6 ) and dependence ( OR=4.1 ) and any personality disorder ( OR=5.1 ) compared to non-illicit drug users.
C	Results indicate important differences in comorbidities of current and former ecstasy users compared to other drug users and lifetime non-illicit drug users that may affect phenotype definitions and etiologic studies.
C	Ecstasy use may represent a distinct population of drug users for which unique treatments may be necessary.

B	Acknowledgement/rejection of adoption related differences and communication about adoption are two of the most important features of adoptive family dynamics.
B	The present study focuses on the role played by these two variables on the adoptees' emotion regulation.
M	The adoptive parents of 70 school-aged children participated in the study.
R	Data showed that participant parents perceived their adopted children's emotion regulation as adequate.
R	In relation to family dynamics , acknowledgment of the adoption specificities significantly predicted the emotional lability/negativity of the adoptees , simultaneously mediated by the emotional quality of and the parental satisfaction with the communication about adoption.
R	Furthermore , there was an indirect effect of early adversity on the adopted child's emotional lability.
C	These findings provide new insight into adopted children's emotional development , highlighting the importance of the family environment and pre-adoption experiences.
P	Symptoms of depression are common in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , but information about underlying developmental factors is limited.
P	Depression is often linked to aspects of emotional functioning such as coping strategies , but in children with ASD difficulties with social interactions are also a likely contributor to depressive symptoms.
M	We examined several aspects of emotional coping ( approach , avoidant , maladaptive ) and social functioning ( victimization , negative friendship interactions ) and their relation to depression symptoms in children with ASD ( N=63 ) and typically developing ( TD ) peers ( N=57 ).
M	Children completed a battery of self-report questionnaires.
R	Less approach and avoidant , but more maladaptive coping strategies , and poor social functioning were uniquely associated with more symptoms of depression in children with ASD.
R	Only less approach and more maladaptive coping were uniquely associated with depression severity in TO boys.
C	Unlike TD boys , boys with ASD who report using avoidant strategies to deal with stressful situations report fewer symptoms of depression , suggesting that this may be an adaptive emotion regulation strategy.
C	However , understanding the role of over-arousal in this process , inferences about long-term effects of this strategy , its causality and direction of effects will require additional research.

B	Age of onset is an important epidemiological indicator in characterizing disorders' subtypes according to demographic , clinical and psychosocial determinants.
B	While investigated in various psychiatric conditions , age of onset and related characteristics in agoraphobia have yet to be examined.
B	In light of the new diagnostic status in the DSM-5 edition of agoraphobia as independent from panic disorder , research on agoraphobia as a stand alone disorder is needed.
M	Admixture analysis was used to determine the best fitting model for the observed ages at onset of 507 agoraphobia patients participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety ( age range 18-65 ).
M	Associations between agoraphobia age of onset and different demographic , clinical and psychosocial determinants were examined using mulLivariare logistic regression analysis.
R	Admixture analyses identified two distributions of age of onset , with 27 as the cutoff age ( <= 27 , early onset , >27 late onset ).
R	Early onset agoraphobia was only independently associated with family history of anxiety disorders ( p < 0.01 )
C	Age of onset was assessed retrospectively , and analyses were based on cross-sectional data
C	The best distinguishing age of onset cutoff of agoraphobia was found to be 27.
C	Early onset agoraphobia might constitute of a familial subtype.
C	As opposed to other psychiatric disorders , early onset in agoraphobia does not indicate for increased clinical severity and/or disability.

B	Knowledge of allele and genotype frequencies is an essential prerequisite to the use of any human polymorphism in forensic work.
P	To study the genetic polymorphism and evaluate the application value of nine STR loci.
M	Genotyping of nine STR loci , including D11S2368 , D12S391 , D13S325 , D18S1364 , D22-GATA198B05 , D6S1043 , D2S1772 , D7S3048 and D8S1132 , of 1050 unrelated individuals was performed with the STR_Typer_10_v1 kit and Genetic Analyzer 3100 and analyzed with PowerState V12.xls and Arlequin ver 3.11 analyzing software.
R	Allele frequency distribution was statistically analyzed and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium determined.
R	Several common parameters used in forensic sciences were found: the heterozygosity ( H ) ranged from 0.827 to 0.892 ; the matching probability ( MP ) ranged from 0.029 to 0.074 ; the power of discrimination ( PD ) ranged from 0.926 to 0.971 ; the power of exclusion ( PE ) ranged from 0.649 to 0.779 ; the polymorphic information content ( PIC ) ranged from 0.77 to 0.86 ; and the typical paternity index ( TPI ) ranged from 2.88 to 4.62.
C	The results indicate that nine STR loci are high polymorphic among the Han population in Southern China.
C	This set of polymorphic STR loci is a useful tool in forensic paternity testing and anthropological study.
B	Cognitive Bias Modification ( CBM ) has been shown to change interpretation biases commonly associated with anxiety and depression and may help ameliorate symptoms of these disorders.
B	However , its evidence base for adolescents is scarce.
B	Previous results have been hard to interpret because of methodological issues.
B	In particular , many studies have used negative bias training as the control condition.
B	This would tend to inflate any apparent benefits of CBM compared to a neutral control.
B	Most studies also only examined the effects of a single training session and lacked follow-up assessment or ecologically valid outcome measures.
M	Seventy-four adolescents , aged 16-18 years , were randomised to two sessions of CBM training or neutral control.
M	Interpretation bias and mood were assessed three times: at baseline , immediately post-training and 1 week post-training.
M	A controlled experimental stressor was also used , and responses to everyday stressors were recorded for 1 week after training to assess responses to psychological challenges.
M	Feedback for the training programme was collected.
R	The CBM group reported a greater reduction in negative affect than control participants.
R	However , other hypothesised advantages of CBM were not demonstrated.
R	Regardless of training group , participants reported increased positive interpretations , decreased negative interpretations , reduced depressive symptoms and no change in trait anxiety.
R	The two groups did not differ in their stress reactivity.
R	After controlling for group differences in training performance , all the mood effects disappeared.
C	When tested under stringent experimental conditions the effects of CBM in healthy adolescents appear to be minimal.
C	Future studies should concentrate on participants with elevated cognitive biases and/ or mood symptoms who may be more sensitive to CBM.
B	Although attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli has been identified as a potentially important factor in initiating a drinking episode , little is known about whether it persists once drinking has begun.
B	Chief among the measures of attentional bias is the visual probe task , which requires the ability to respond quickly and fixate on objects.
B	Alcohol is well recognized for impairing both of these abilities , which could undermine the reliable detection of attentional bias in intoxicated individuals.
B	The purpose of the present study was to determine if attentional bias toward alcohol-related images can still be observed under alcohol even at blood alcohol concentrations ( BACs ) sufficient to disrupt reaction time ( RT ) and basic ocular functions.
M	The present study employed a within-subject design to test the effects of three doses of alcohol ( 0.0 g/kg , 0.32 g/kg , and 0.64 g/kg ) on attentional bias toward alcohol-related images in a group of 20 social drinkers using a visual probe task.
M	Alcohol's effects on simple RT and ocular functions were also assessed.
R	Attentional bias was observed by participants' fixations toward alcohol-related stimuli following alcohol administration.
R	Alcohol also impaired oculomotor functions as evident by decreased accuracy and speed of saccades.
C	The findings indicate that attentional bias can be detected even at BACs above 80 mg/100 ml that disrupt oculomotor functions that are considered fundamental to visual search tasks.

B	Little is known about the relationship between disability and mode of delivery.
B	Prior research has indicated elevated risk of cesarean delivery among women with certain disabilities , but has not examined patterns across multiple types of disability or by parity.
P	This study sought to determine whether physical , sensory , or intellectual and developmental disabilities are independently associated with primary cesarean delivery.
M	We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries in California from 2000 to 2010 using linked birth certificate and hospital discharge data.
M	We identified physical , sensory , and intellectual and developmental disabilities using International Classification of Diseases , 9th revision , clinical modification codes.
M	We used logistic regression to examine the association of these disabilities and primary cesarean delivery , controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities , and stratified by parity.
R	In our sample , 0.45% of deliveries ( 20 ,894/4 ,610 ,955 ) were to women with disabilities.
R	A greater proportion of women with disabilities were nulliparous , had public insurance , and had comorbidities ( e.g. , gestational diabetes ) compared with women without disabilities ( p < .001 for all ).
R	The proportion of primary cesarean in women with disabilities was twice that in women without disabilities ( 32.7% vs. 16.3% ; p < .001 ; adjusted odds ratio , 2.05 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.94-2.17 ).
R	The proportion of deliveries by cesarean was highest among women with physical disabilities due to injuries compared with women without disabilities ( 57.8% vs. 16.3% ; p < .001 ; adjusted odds ratio , 6.83 ; 95% confidence interval , 5.46-8.53 ).
C	Women across disability subgroups have higher odds of cesarean delivery , and there is heterogeneity by disability type.
C	More attention is needed to this population to ensure better understanding of care practices that may impact maternal and perinatal outcomes.

B	Overtreatment ( or unnecessary treatment ) is when medical or dental services are provided with a higher volume or cost than is appropriate.
B	This study aimed to investigate how a group of dentists in Switzerland , a wealthy country known to have high standards of healthcare including dentistry , evaluated the meaning of unnecessary treatments from an ethical perspective and , assessed the expected frequency of different possible behaviors among their peers.
M	A vignette describing a situation that is susceptible for overtreatment of a patient was presented to a group of dentists.
M	The vignette was followed by five options.
M	A questionnaire including the vignette was posted to 2482 dentists in the German-speaking areas of Switzerland.
M	The respondents were asked to rate each option according to their estimation about its prevalence and their judgment about the degree to which the behavior is ethically sound.
R	732 completed questionnaires were returned.
R	According to the responses , the most ethical and the most unethical options are considered to be the most and the least prevalent behaviors among dentists practicing in Switzerland , respectively.
C	Suggesting unnecessary treatments to patients seems to be an ethically unacceptable conduct in the eyes of a sample of dentists in Switzerland.
C	Although the respondents believed their colleagues were very likely to behave in an ethical way in response to a situation that is susceptible to overtreatment , they still seemed to be concerned about the prevalence of unethical behaviors in this regard.
B	It has been suggested that hypercortisolism contributes to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) , based on the fact that excess glucocorticoid exposure has potent adverse effects on the central nervous system.
B	In contrast , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) has been linked to a broad range of beneficial physiological effects including neuronal excitability and neuroprotection and even memory enhancing properties.
B	Of note , proinflammatory cytokines are present in neuritic plaques ( a hallmark of AD ) and may regulate cortisol/DHEA release.
B	In this exploratory study , we hypothesized that there is a flattened diurnal curve of cortisol and DHEA in mild to moderate AD , linked to increased cytokine levels.
M	Diurnal profiles of cortisol , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , and DHEA were studied in 15 patients with mild to moderate AD ( 7 men and 8 women , 75.6 +/- 5.5 years ) and 15 healthy elderly controls ( 7 men and 8 women , 73.3 +/- 5.8 years , respectively ).
M	Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and soluble TNF receptors were analyzed.
R	Women with AD had significantly increased morning levels of ACTH , DHEA , and IL-6 compared to healthy elderly women.
R	Cortisol levels were significantly increased in men with AD at 0300 h versus healthy elderly men , in spite of slightly decreased ACTH levels.
C	Our data suggest important sex differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis regulation and steroid hormone clearance in patients with AD.
C	Increased secretion of IL-6 may have a contributory role in this difference.
B	Varenicline is an effective smoking cessation medication.
B	Some concern has been raised that its use may precipitate adverse cardiovascular events although no patho-physiological mechanism potentially underlying such an effect has been reported.
B	The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that varenicline impacts on sympatho-vagal balance during smoking withdrawal.
M	In this randomised , placebo-controlled trial , muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) , baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) , heart rate , and blood pressure were assessed in 17 smokers four weeks before a quit attempt ( baseline ) and again on the third day of that quit attempt ( acute smoking withdrawal ).
R	Regarding the primary endpoint of our study , we did not find a significant effect of varenicline compared to placebo on changes in MSNA burst incidence between baseline and acute smoking withdrawal ( -3.0 +/- 3.3 vs.-3.9 +/- 5.0 bursts/100 heart beats ; p = 0.308 ).
R	However , heart rate and systolic blood pressure significantly decreased in the placebo group only , while no significant changes in these parameters were observed in the varenicline group.
R	Exposure to smoking cues during acute withdrawal lead to a significant increase of heart rate in the placebo group , while heart rate decreased in the varenicline group , and the difference in these changes was significant between groups ( + 2.7 +/- 1.0 vs.-1.8 +/- 0.5 1/min ; p = 0.002 ).
R	In all 17 participants combined , a significant increase in heart rate during smoking cue exposure was detected in subjects who relapsed in the course of six weeks after the quit date compared to those who stayed abstinent ( + 2.5 +/- 1.2 vs.-1.1 +/- 0.7 ; p = 0.018 ).
R	Six-week abstinence rates were higher in the varenicline group compared to placebo ( 88 vs. 22 % p = 0.015 ).
C	We did not find evidence of adverse effects of varenicline on sympatho-vagal balance.
C	Varenicline probably blunts the heart rate response to smoking cues , which may be linked to improved cessation outcome.
B	Family violence is a significant and complex public health problem that demands collaboration between researchers , practitioners , and policymakers for systemic , sustainable solutions.
B	An integrated knowledge translation network was developed to support joint research production and application in the area.
B	The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the international Preventing Violence Across the Lifespan ( PreVAiL ) Research Network built effective partnerships among its members , with a focus on the knowledge user partner perspective.
M	This mixed-methods study employed a combination of questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to understand partnerships two years after PreVAiL's inception.
M	The questionnaire examined communication , collaborative research , dissemination of research , research findings , negotiation , partnership enhancement , information needs , rapport , and commitment.
M	The interviews elicited feedback about partners' experiences with being part of the network.
R	Five main findings were highlighted: i ) knowledge user partner involvement varied across activities , ranging from 11% to 79% participation rates ; ii ) partners and researchers generally converged on their assessment of communication indicators ; iii ) partners valued the network at both an individual level and to fulfill their organizations' mandates ; iv ) being part of PreVAiL allowed partners to readily contact researchers , and partners felt comfortable acting as an intermediary between PreVAiL and the rest of their own organization ; v ) application of research was just emerging ; partners needed more actionable insights to determine ways to move forward given the research at that point in time.
C	Our results demonstrate the importance of developing and nurturing strong partnerships for integrated knowledge translation.
C	Our findings are applicable to other network- oriented partnerships where a diversity of stakeholders work to address complex , multi-faceted public health problems.
P	The purpose of this appraisal is to offer guidance to clinicians on applying motor imagery in neurorehabilitation and provide guidance to support this process.
M	We used evidence from a variety of fields as well as clinical experience with motor imagery to develop guidance for employing motor imagery during neurorehabilitation.
R	Motor imagery is a relatively new intervention for neurorehabilitation supported by evidence from areas such as cognitive neuroscience and sports psychology.
R	Motor imagery has become a very popular intervention modality for clinicians but there is insufficient information available on how to administer it in clinical practice and make deliberate decisions during its application.
C	We provide evidence-based guidance for employing motor imagery in neurorehabilitation and use the principles of motor learning as the framework for clinical application.
B	Fair prioritization of healthcare resources has been on the agenda for decades , but resource allocation dilemmas in clinical practice remain challenging.
B	Can clinical ethics committees ( CECs ) be of help?
B	The aim of the study was to explore whether and how CECs handle priority setting dilemmas and contribute to raising awareness of fairness concerns.
M	Descriptions of activities involving priority setting in annual reports from Norwegian CECs ( 2003-2015 ) were studied and categorized through qualitative content analysis.
R	Three hundred thirty-nine reports from 38 CECs were studied.
R	We found 78 activities where resource use or priority setting were explicitly highlighted as main topics.
R	Of these , 29 were seminars or other educational activities , 21 were deliberations on individual patient cases , whereas 28 were discussions of principled or general cases.
R	Individual patient cases concerned various distributional dilemmas where values were at stake.
R	Six main topics and seven roles for the CEC were identified.
R	CECs handle issues concerning the introduction of new costly drugs , extraordinarily costly established treatment , the application of priority setting criteria , resource use for vulnerable groups , resource constraints compromising practice , and futility of care.
R	The CEC can act as an analyst , advisor , moderator , disseminator , facilitator , watch dog , and guardian of values and laws.
C	In order to fulfil their responsibilities in handling priority setting cases , CECs need knowledge of both the ethics and the institutionalized systems of priority setting.
C	There is potential for developing this aspect of the CECs' work further.
C	The Norwegian CECs are involved in priority setting decisions where they can play multiple constructive roles.
C	In particular , they advise and raise awareness of ethical aspects in resource allocations ; bridge clinical practice with higher-level decisions ; and promote fair resource allocation and stakeholder rights and interests.
B	Heart failure is associated with exacerbated symptoms such as dyspnea and edema and results in frequent hospitalization and a poor quality of life.
B	With the adoption of a comprehensive nursing care and follow-up program , patients with heart failure may exhibit improvements in their self-care capabilities and their hospitalizations may be reduced.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a nursing care and follow-up program for patients with heart failure on self-care , quality of life , and rehospitalization.
M	This research was conducted as a single-center , single-blind , randomized controlled study at the heart failure outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Turkey.
M	A total of 90 patients with heart failure were randomly assigned into either the specialized nursing care group ( n = 45 ) or the control group ( n =45 ).
M	The nursing care and follow-up program applied in the intervention group was based on the Theory of Heart Failure Self-care.
M	Data were collected at the beginning of the trial , and at three and six months after the study commenced.
M	Self-care of the patients was assessed by the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index.
M	Quality of life was assessed with the "Left Ventricular Dysfunction Scale".
M	Rehospitalization was evaluated based on information provided by the patients or by hospital records.
R	A statistically significant difference was found between the intervention and control group with respect to the self-care and quality of life scores at both three and six months.
R	While the intervention group experienced fewer rehospitalizations at three months , no significant differences were found at six months.
C	The results obtained in this study show that the nursing care and follow-up program implemented for patients with heart failure improved self-care and quality of life.
C	Although there were no significant differences between the groups at six months , fewer rehospitalizations in the intervention group was considered to be an important result.

B	The purpose of the current study was to describe tuberculosis ( TB ) knowledge , beliefs , and experience with TB services among injecting drug users.
M	Participants for this anonymous , cross-sectional study were recruited from a community based syringe exchange programme in Tallinn , Estonia.
M	A structured questionnaire was completed and included information on socio-demographics , health history , drug use , and knowledge about TB and HIV.
R	The study included 407 people ( 79% male , mean age 27.9 years , mean injection drug use 9.4 years ).
R	32.9% of participants reported HIV infection and 1.7% lifetime history of TB.
R	26.4% participants ( n=106 ) reported symptoms suggestive of TB.
R	93% of participants recognized correctly that TB is air-borne infection and 91% that HIV is a risk factor for TB.
R	Only 40% of the participants knew that TB diagnostics and treatment in Estonia are free of charge for everybody and 58% reported they knew where to get health care services in case they suspected that they had TB.
R	TB transmission and treatment adherence knowledge was better among those in contact with either health care or harm reduction services , e.g the community based syringe exchange programme.
C	Similar to HIV services , TB prevention and education should be integrated into harm reduction and drug treatment programmes to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of TB among injecting drug users.
B	Post-visit "booster" sessions have been recommended to augment the impact of brief interventions delivered in the emergency department ( ED ).
B	This paper , which focuses on implementation issues , presents descriptive information and interventionists' qualitative perspectives on providing brief interventions over the phone , challenges , "lessons learned" , and recommendations for others attempting to implement adjunctive booster calls.
M	Attempts were made to complete two 20-minute telephone "booster" calls within a week following a patient's ED discharge with 425 patients who screened positive for and had recent problematic substance use other than alcohol or nicotine.
R	Over half ( 56.2% ) of participants completed the initial call ; 66.9% of those who received the initial call also completed the second call.
R	Median number of attempts to successfully contact participants for the first and second calls were 4 and 3 , respectively.
R	Each completed call lasted an average of about 22 minutes.
R	Common challenges/ barriers identified by booster callers included unstable housing , limited phone access , unavailability due to additional treatment , lack of compensation for booster calls , and booster calls coming from an area code different than the participants' locale and from someone other than ED staff.
C	Specific recommendations are presented with respect to implementing a successful centralized adjunctive booster call system.
C	Future use of booster calls might be informed by research on contingency management ( e.g. , incentivizing call completions ) , smoking cessation quitlines , and phone-based continuing care for substance abuse patients.
C	Future research needs to evaluate the incremental benefit of adjunctive booster calls on outcomes over and above that of brief motivational interventions delivered in the ED setting.

B	Adiantum capillus-veneris Linn ( Maidenhair fern ) is an herb belonging to the family Pteridaceae.
B	It is named as "Pare-siavashan" in medical and pharmaceutical textbooks of Iranian Traditional Medicine.
B	The fronds of Maidenhair fern were mainly administrated by ancient physicians as single medicine or in combination with other plants in multi-herbal formulations for curing different diseases.
B	Because of different chemical compositions , the herb fronds were also assessed for its numerous pharmacological effects.
B	Therefore , the current study was done to review the traditional usage and modern pharmacological and toxicological effects of Maidenhair fern.
M	Scientific databases and publications including Web of Science , PubMed , Scopus , Science direct , Cochrane Library , SID ( for Persian papers ) and medical and pharmaceutical textbooks of traditional medicine as well were searched for "Adiantum capillus-veneris" , "Maidenhair fern" and "Pare-siavashan" without limitation up to 2016.
R	Maidenhair fern exhibited to possess anti-diabetic , anticonvulsant , analgesic , hypocholesterolemic , goitrogenic , anti-thyroidal , antibacterial , antifungal , wound healing , antiobesity , anti hair loss , anti-asthmatic , anti-inflammatory , antidiarrheal and antispasmodic , antioxidant as well as diuretic , anti-urolithiatic and detoxifying effects in modern medicine.
R	Ancient physicians declared some of the confirmed pharmacological effects.
C	Maidenhair fern frond can be a good candidate for clinical purpose.
C	Therefore , future researches on the other mentioned effects in traditional medicine are recommended.
B	Depression and frailty both predict disability and morbidity in later life.
B	However , it is unclear to what extent these common geriatric syndromes represent overlapping constructs.
P	To examine the joint relationship between the constructs of depression and frailty.
M	Data come from 2004-2005 wave of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study , and the analysis is limited to participants 40 years and older , with complete data on frailty and depression indicators ( N = 683 ).
M	Depression was measured using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule , and frailty was indexed by modified Fried criteria.
M	A series of confirmatory latent class analyses were used to assess the degree to which depression and frailty syndromes identify the same populations.
M	A latent kappa coefficient ( kappa( l ) ) was also estimated between the constructs.
R	Confirmatory latent class analyses indicated that depression and frailty represent distinct syndromes rather than a single construct.
R	The joint modeling of the two constructs supported a three-class solution for depression and two-class solution for frailty , with 2.9% categorized as severely depressed , 19.4% as mildly depressed , and 77.7% as not depressed , and 21.1% categorized as frail and 78.9% as not frail.
R	The chance-corrected agreement statistic indicated moderate correspondence between the depression and frailty constructs ( kappa( l ): 66 , 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.74 ).
C	Results suggest that depression and frailty are interrelated concepts , yet their operational criteria identify substantively overlapping subpopulations.
C	These findings have implications for understanding factors that contribute to the etiology and prognosis of depression and frailty in later life.
B	Depression is common among patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and has a major impact on their quality of life , morbidity and mortality.
P	The aim of this study was to map the 12-month psychosocial outcomes of patients with CHD who were screened positive for depression in an acute cardiac ward.
M	A prospective cohort study was conducted of the psychosocial trajectory ( depression , anxiety , wellbeing , social support , mental health service access ) of 212 patients with CHD who were screened for depression after being admitted to acute cardiac wards of a major metropolitan hospital.
M	Outcomes were assessed before hospital discharge and at one , three , six and 12 months post-discharge.
R	Linear mixed models identified that those patients screened at moderate to high' risk of depression at baseline had higher levels of depression ( F( 1 ,173 )=53.93 , p<0.0001 ) and anxiety ( F( 1 ,180 )=67.01 , p<0.001 ) , and lower levels of wellbeing ( F( 1 ,186 )=42.47 , p<0.001 ) and social support ( F( 1 ,177 )=25.40 , p<0.0001 ) , compared to those at no to low' risk of depression.
R	Levels of depression and wellbeing remained fairly constant over the 12-month trajectory.
R	Surgical and medical treatment groups were of similar psychological composition over the 12-month period.
C	These findings attest to the effectiveness and predictive validity of a simple nurse-administered screening tool designed to identify depression in hospital patients with CHD and also indicate that a screening and referral tool alone is not sufficient to achieve optimal disease management.
C	A collaborative care model involving family members and integrated pathways to primary care is recommended.
B	Screening newly arrived migrants from countries with high burden of communicable diseases of public health significance is part of the Swedish national strategy against the spread of these diseases.
B	However , little is known about its implementation.
P	This study aimed at exploring caregivers' experiences in screening newly arrived migrants to generate knowledge that could inform policy and clinical practice.
M	Using an interpretive description framework , we conducted semistructured interviews between November and December 2011 in four Swedish counties , with 15 purposively selected nurses with experience in screening migrants.
M	Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
R	Participants described a range of challenges including discordant views between migrants and the nurses about medical screening , inconsistencies in rules and practices , and conflicting policies.
R	Participants indicated that sociocultural differences resulted in divergent expectations with migrants viewing the participants as agents of migration authorities.
R	They also expressed concern over being given a new assignment without training and being expected to share responsibilities with staff from other agencies without adequate coordination.
R	Finally , they indicated that existing policies can be confusing and raise ethical issues.
R	All these were compounded by language barriers , making their work environment extremely complex and stressful.
C	These findings illuminate complex challenges that could limit access to , uptake , and delivery of health screening and undermine public health goals , and highlight the need for a multilevel approach.
C	This entails avoiding the conflation of migration with health issues , harmonizing existing policies to make health care services more accessible and acceptable to migrants , and facilitating health professionals' work in promoting public health , improving interagency collaboration and the skills of all staff involved in understanding and effectively responding to migrants' needs , and improving migrants' health literacy through community outreach interventions.
B	Ecstasy use has increasingly become popular among young adults.
B	many of whom view it as a safe drug with no or limited negative social and health consequences.
B	In this paper , we explore the perceptions of ecstasy users about its recreational use as well as regarding the normalisation of use.
M	The study participants were recruited using targeted and theoretical sampling.
M	To be eligible , they had to be between 18 and 25 years and have used ecstasy at least four times within the past 90 days.
M	In-depth interviews were conducted with 112 individuals.
M	Data analysis included the constant comparison method commonly used in modified grounded theory.
R	The study participants associated their recreational ecstasy use with control , shaping both the timing and setting of their use.
R	In addition , they supported that easy access/availability and social accommodations of use contributed to their acceptance of ecstasy use as a normal part of life.
R	Moreover , low risk perceptions of the social and health consequences of ecstasy used were identified as resulting in normalisation.
C	The study findings reveal the importance of considering recreational ecstasy use from the perspective of the users themselves for prevention efforts and when providing social and health services , including intervention strategies.
C	In addition , the potential normalisation of ecstasy use must be considered.

B	The FDA is considering reducing the nicotine content in tobacco products as a population-based strategy to reduce tobacco addiction.
B	Research is needed to determine the threshold level of nicotine needed to maintain smoking and the extent of compensatory smoking that could occur during nicotine reduction.
B	Sources of variability in these measures across sub-populations also need to be identified so that policies can take into account the risks and benefits of nicotine reduction in vulnerable populations.
M	The present study examined these issues in a rodent nicotine self-administration model of nicotine reduction policy to characterize individual differences in nicotine reinforcement thresholds , degree of compensation , and elasticity of demand during progressive reduction of the unit nicotine dose.
M	The ability of individual differences in baseline nicotine intake and nicotine pharmacokinetics to predict responses to dose reduction was also examined.
R	Considerable variability in the reinforcement threshold , compensation , and elasticity of demand was evident.
R	High baseline nicotine intake was not correlated with the reinforcement threshold , but predicted less compensation and less elastic demand.
R	Higher nicotine clearance predicted low reinforcement thresholds , greater compensation , and less elastic demand.
R	Less elastic demand also predicted lower reinforcement thresholds.
C	These findings suggest that baseline nicotine intake , nicotine clearance , and the essential value of nicotine ( i.e. elasticity of demand ) moderate the effects of progressive nicotine reduction in rats and warrant further study in humans.
C	They also suggest that smokers with fast nicotine metabolism may be more vulnerable to the risks of nicotine reduction.

B	Terminally ill patients can benefit from palliative care , including relief from physical and emotional suffering , improved quality of life , and longer survival rates.
B	However , despite marked development in other countries , palliative care is still in its infancy in China.
P	The general population and healthcare professionals in China have yet to realize the importance of palliative care services.
P	This article describes the status of palliative care services in China , the historic development of palliative care , and the barriers to its advancement.
M	The status quo of hospice and palliative care in China is reviewed , and suggestions are provided on how nurses can improve their abilities to care for patients with cancer at the end of life.
R	A significant amount of work is needed in China to meet the standards of international palliative care societies.
R	Palliative care training for nurses is still very limited.
R	Nurses and other health providers who are engaged in palliative care should be well trained regarding the principles and procedures of palliative care to ensure quality care.
P	Phonation threshold pressure and perceived phonatory effort were hypothesized to increase and upper airway temperature to decrease following exposure to cold and/or dry air.
P	Greater changes were expected with mouth versus nose breathing.
M	In a within-participant repeated measures design , 15 consented participants ( 7 men , 8 women ) completed 20-min duration trials to allow for adequate thermal equilibration for both nose and mouth breathing in 5 different environments: 3 temperatures ( degrees C ) matched for relative humidity ( % RH ) , cold ( 15 degrees C , 40% RH ) , thermally neutral ( 25 degrees C , 40% RH ) , and hot ( 35 degrees C , 40% RH ) ; and 2 temperatures with variable relative humidity to match vapor pressure for the neutral environment ( 25 degrees C , 40% RH ) , cold ( 15 degrees C , 74% RH ) and hot ( 35 degrees C , 23% RH ).
M	Following equilibration trial , measures were taken in this order: upper airway temperature ( transnasal thermistor probe ) , phonation threshold pressure , and perceived phonatory effort.
R	Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance , and no significant differences were established.
C	The study hypotheses were not supported.
C	Findings suggest that the upper airway is tightly regulated for temperature when challenged by a realistic range of temperature and relative humidity environments.
C	This is the first study of its kind to include measurement of upper airway temperature in conjunction with measures of vocal function.
B	This paper presents a new psychological model of why low income increases risk of mental distress.
B	Consistent with evolutionary perspectives on disorder , income was predicted to relate to mental distress only through acting as an indirect proxy for social rank.
M	Participants were part of a longitudinal cohort sample of 30 ,000 people who were representative of the British population and who completed measures annually for up to 17 years.
M	Mental distress was assessed via the General Health Questionnaire which measures anxiety , depression , and general functioning.
R	Both income and the rank of the income within the region ( and the rank of income within other comparison groups , such as similar individuals ) predicted current and future distress.
R	However , when distress was jointly regressed on income and income rank , only income rank remained a significant predictor.
C	The outcome measure was self-report ( although the predictor was objective ).
C	The results support psychosocial rather than material explanations of why income relates to distress , and suggest that a concern for social rank is the mechanism through which these effects occur.
C	This mechanism is consistent with an evolutionarily based "involuntary defeat syndrome" where hard wired responses to low social rank increase risk for disorder and the Decision by Sampling model of how people make relative judgments.
C	Negative cognitions associated with low social rank ( particularly defeat and entrapment ) may be clinically targetable in both prevention and treatment programs to reduce socio-economic mental health disparities.

B	Understanding different longitudinal patterns of traumatic stress reactions in children exposed to intimate partner violence ( IPV ) can promote early identification of at-risk children.
P	Our study aims to explore trajectories of traumatic stress reactions following childhood IPV exposure , and their relation with parental traumatic stress and child emotional security in the interparental subsystem.
P	Participants and
M	The sample comprised 303 children ( age 3-10 , M = 6.20 ) from families referred to institutions for IPV.
M	Data were collected at home.
M	Three waves of parent-reported questionnaire data were analyzed using latent class growth analysis and linear regression.
R	Five trajectories were identified: 'resilient' , 'moderate stable' , 'struggling' , 'improving' , and 'elevated adjusting'.
R	Only the 'struggling' trajectory had dysfunctional symptom levels at the final wave.
R	Higher parental traumatic stress predicted 'improving' trajectory membership ( beta = 0.17 , p = .033 ) , whereas lower parental traumatic stress ( beta = -0.20 , p = .003 ) and child emotional insecurity ( beta = -0.45 , p = < .001 ) predicted 'resilient' trajectory membership.
R	Higher child emotional insecurity predicted membership in trajectories with higher initial traumatic stress ( improving: beta = 0.26 , p < .001 ; struggling: beta = 0.31 , p < .001 ; elevated adjusting: beta = 0.27 , p < .001 ).
R	Child emotional security did not buffer the effect of parental traumatic stress on likelihood of dysfunctional trajectory membership ( beta = 0.04 , p = .380 ).
C	Children exposed to IPV show different trajectories of traumatic stress reactions , partly corresponding to trajectories identified in other populations.
C	Child emotional security and parental traumatic stress predict trajectory membership.
B	Boredom has been reported as a common experience for service users of acute psychiatric wards.
B	It has been associated with negative mental and physical health.
B	Research has yet to show what factors are associated with boredom proneness within the acute psychiatric population.
P	( 1 ) To investigate the distribution of boredom proneness in a population of mentally ill inpatients according to age , gender , diagnosis , Mental Health Act status and length of stay in hospital.
P	( 2 ) To test the hypothesis that boredom proneness is negatively correlated with autonomous activity levels.
M	Two self-report questionnaires were used with 55 inpatients of acute psychiatric wards: the Boredom Proneness Scale ( Farmer & Sundberg , 1986 ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( Zigmond & Snaith , 1983 ).
M	Questions were also asked about individuals' activity engagement during their current admission.
M	Data on age , gender , diagnosis , ethnicity , Mental Health Act status and length of stay were collected from case notes.
C	The highest incidence of boredom proneness was in participants with depression.
C	Those detained under the Mental Health Act appeared less boredom prone than those admitted voluntarily.
C	Boredom proneness was not associated with age , gender or length of stay.
C	There was an association between engagement in more autonomous activities and lower boredom proneness.
B	The knowledge translation field is undermined by two interrelated gaps underdevelopment of the science and limited use of research in health services and health systems decision making.
B	The importance of context in theory development and successful translation of knowledge has been identified in past research.
B	Additionally , examination of knowledge translation in the long-term care ( LTC ) sector has been seriously neglected , despite the fact that aging is increasingly identified as a priority area in health and health services research.
P	The aims of this study are: to build knowledge translation theory about the role of organizational context in influencing knowledge use in LTC settings and among regulated and unregulated caregivers , to pilot knowledge translation interventions , and to contribute to enhanced use of new knowledge in LTC.
M	This is a multi-level and longitudinal program of research comprising two main interrelated projects and a series of pilot studies.
M	An integrated mixed method design will be used , including sequential and simultaneous phases to enable the projects to complement and inform one another.
M	Inferences drawn from the quantitative and qualitative analyses will be merged to create meta-inferences.
R	Outcomes will include contributions to ( knowledge translation ) theory development , progress toward resolution of major conceptual issues in the field , progress toward resolution of methodological problems in the field , and advances in the design of effective knowledge translation strategies.
R	Importantly , a better understanding of the contextual influences on knowledge use in LTC will contribute to improving outcomes for residents and providers in LTC settings.
B	An emerging literature reports that women who reside in socioeconomically deprived communities are less likely to adhere to mammography screening.
B	This study explored associations between area-level socioeconomic measures and mammography screening among a racially and ethnically diverse sample of women in Texas.
M	We conducted a cross-sectional , multilevel study linking individual-level data from the 2010 Health of Houston Survey and contextual data from the U.S. Census.
M	Women ages 40 to 74 years ( n = 1 ,541 ) were included in the analyses.
M	We examined tract-level poverty , unemployment , education , Hispanic and Black composition , female-headed householder families , and crowding as contextual measures.
M	Using multilevel logistic regression modeling , we compared most disadvantaged tracts ( quartiles 2-4 ) to the most advantaged tract ( quartile 1 ).
R	Overall , 64% of the sample was adherent to mammography screening.
R	Screening rates were lower ( p < .05 ) among Hispanics , those foreign born , women aged 40 to 49 years , and those with low educational attainment , unemployed , and without health insurance coverage.
R	Women living in areas with high levels of poverty ( quartile 2 vs. 1: odds ratio [OR] , 0.50 ; 95% CI , 0.30-0.85 ) , Hispanic composition ( quartile 3 vs. 1: OR , 0.54 ; 95% CI , 0.32-0.90 ) , and crowding ( quartile 4 vs. 1: OR , 0.53 ; 95% CI , 0.29-0.96 ) were less likely to have up-to-date mammography screening , net of individual-level factors.
C	Our findings highlight the importance of examining area-level socioeconomic inequalities in mammography screening.
C	The study represents an advance on previous research because we examined multiple area measures , controlled for key individual-level covariates , used data aggregated at the tract level , and accounted for the nested structure of the data.

B	Sexual expression by forensic psychiatric patients is poorly researched.
M	Forensic experts representing 14 European countries were interviewed to explore the diverse ways in which sexual expression within forensic settings is handled.
R	No country had a national policy , although many had local policies or shared practices.
R	Progressive approaches to patient sexuality were evident in nine of the countries sampled.
R	The UK appeared the most prohibiting and excluding , its protocols apparently based on risk aversion and lack of emphasis or consideration of patients' sexual needs.
C	Uniform national policy supporting patients' sexual expression would provide significant improvements.
P	Agreement across methods for identifying students as inadequate responders or as learning disabled is often poor.
P	We report ( 1 ) an empirical examination of final status ( postintervention benchmarks ) and dual-discrepancy growth methods based on growth during the intervention and final status for assessing response to intervention and ( 2 ) a statistical simulation of psychometric issues that may explain low agreement.
M	After a Tier 2 intervention , final status benchmark criteria were used to identify 104 inadequate and 85 adequate responders to intervention , with comparisons of agreement and coverage for these methods and a dual-discrepancy method.
M	Factors affecting agreement were investigated using computer simulation to manipulate reliability , the intercorrelation between measures , cutoff points , normative samples , and sample size.
R	Identification of inadequate responders based on individual measures showed that single measures tended not to identify many members of the pool of 104 inadequate responders.
R	Poor to fair levels of agreement for identifying inadequate responders were apparent between pairs of measures.
R	In the simulation , comparisons across 2 simulated measures generated indices of agreement ( kappa ) that were generally low because of multiple psychometric issues inherent in any test.
C	Expecting excellent agreement between 2 correlated tests with even small amounts of unreliability may not be realistic.
C	Assessing outcomes based on multiple measures , such as level of curriculum-based measure performance and short norm-referenced assessments of fluency , may improve the reliability of diagnostic decisions.
P	This study investigated the acoustic properties of 6 Taiwan Southern Min vowels produced by 10 laryngeal speakers ( LA ) , 10 speakers with a pneumatic artificial larynx ( PA ) , and 8 esophageal speakers ( ES ).
M	Each of the 6 monophthongs of Taiwan Southern Min ( /i , e , a , o , e/ ) was represented by a Taiwan Southern Min character and appeared randomly on a list 3 times ( 6 Taiwan Southern Min characters x 3 repetitions = 18 tokens ).
M	Each Taiwan Southern Min character in this study has the same syllable structure , /V/ , and all were read with tone 1 ( high and level ).
M	Acoustic measurements of the 1st formant , 2nd formant , and 3rd formant were taken for each vowel.
M	Then , vowel space areas ( VSAs ) enclosed by /i , a , u/were calculated for each group of speakers.
M	The Euclidean distance between vowels in the pairs /i , a/ , /i , u/ , and /a , u/ was also calculated and compared across the groups.
R	PA and ES have higher 1st or 2nd formant values than LA for each vowel.
R	The distance is significantly shorter between vowels in the corner vowel pairs /i , a/and /i , u/.
R	PA and ES have a significantly smaller VSA compared with LA.
C	In accordance with previous studies , alaryngeal speakers have higher formant frequency values than LA because they have a shortened vocal tract as a result of their total laryngectomy.
C	Furthermore , the resonance frequencies are inversely related to the length of the vocal tract ( on the basis of the assumption of the source filter theory ).
C	PA and ES have a smaller VSA and shorter distances between corner vowels compared with LA , which may be related to speech intelligibility.
C	This hypothesis needs further support from future study.
B	Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide , but its spatial distribution is not homogeneous.
B	The objective of this study is to analyze the spatial pattern of mortality from these diseases for men and women , in the populated urban area ( AUP ) of the municipality of Madrid , and to identify spatial aggregations.
M	An ecological study was carried out by census tract , for men and women in 2010.
M	Standardized Mortality Ratio ( SMR ) , Relative Risk Smoothing ( RRS ) and Posterior Probability ( PP ) were calculated to consider the spatial pattern of the disease.
M	To identify spatial clusters the Moran index ( Moran I ) and the Local Index of Spatial Autocorrelation ( LISA ) were used.
M	The results were mapped.
R	SMR higher than 1.1 was observed mainly in central areas among men and in peripheral areas among women.
R	The PP that RRS was higher than 1 surpassed 0.8 in the center and in the periphery , in both men and women.
R	Moran's I was 0.04 for men and 0.03 for women ( p < 0.05 in both cases ).
C	Sex differences were observed in the spatial distribution of mortality cases.
C	RME RRS and PP maps showed a heterogeneous pattern in men , whereas in women a clearer pattern was detected , with a relatively higher risk in peripheral areas of the AUP.
C	The LISA method showed similar patterns to those previously observed.
P	The purpose of this study was to develop a measurement tool of nurse's turnover intention.
M	Data were collected from questionnaires completed by 678 nurses who worked in 3 university hospitals in South Korea and analyzed using the SPSS 18.0 and AMOS 18 programs.
M	Thirty-seven preliminary items were selected from 161 basic items extracted via a literature review and in depth interviews with 6 hospital nurses.
M	Three steps with factor analysis were undertaken to verify the reliability and validity of the preliminary instruments.
M	Finally , confirmative factor analysis was carried out.
R	As a result of the analysis , 3 factors including 10 items were selected.
R	Cronbach's Alpha for the 10 items was .83 , for job satisfaction ( 4 items ) , .78 , for interpersonal relationships ( 3 items ) , .80 , and for work performance ( 3 items ) , .74 , which was stable.
C	This study is meaningful because through it a scale reflecting Korean culture was developed to measure turnover intention in nurses.
C	Further studies that test the psychometrics of this scale in more diverse samples are warranted.
B	There is limited research on factors that influence the rate of progression in Alzheimer's disease ( AD ).
B	A history of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is associated with an increased risk for AD , but its role on the rate of dementia progression after the onset of AD has not been examined.
M	A population-based cohort of 325 persons with incident AD was followed for up to 11 years.
M	The sample was 65% female with a mean ( SD ) age of dementia onset = 84.4 ( 6.4 ) years.
M	History of TBI was categorized as number , severity ( with or without loss of consciousness ) , and timing in relation to dementia onset ( within ten years or more than ten years ).
M	Cognition was assessed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry of AD battery , and functional ability was assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes.
R	In linear mixed models , a history of TBI within ten years of onset showed faster progression of functional impairment ( LR x( 2 ) = 10.27 , p = 0.006 ) , while those with TBI more than ten years before dementia onset had higher scores on a measure of list learning ( beta = 1.61 , p = 0.003 ) and semantic memory ( beta = 0.75 , p = 0.0035 ).
C	History of TBI and its recency may be a useful factor to predict functional progression in the course of AD.
B	Organised abuse ( where multiple adults conspire to sexually abuse multiple children ) has been one of the most controversial issues in debates over mental health practice with survivors of child sexual abuse.
P	The aim of this paper is to summarise and analyse the available prevalence data pertinent to organised abuse and to identify the challenges that organised abuse poses for mental health policy and practice.
M	Prevalence studies of sexual abuse based on community and clinical samples were reviewed for findings pertinent to organised abuse.
M	Key indicators of organised abuse were selected and summarised on the basis of their association with the known characteristics of organised abuse.
M	The literature regarding the health impacts of these indicators was also reviewed.
R	A minority of people reporting contact sexual abuse in the community report experiences indicative of organised abuse.
R	These indicators are elevated in particular settings and they are associated with poor mental and physical health.
C	Organised abuse is rare but it is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes.
C	There is currently no source of integrated care for adults with histories of organised abuse.
C	Many survivors end up in prison or homeless , chronically disabled by illness , or dead.
B	The tradition of female genital mutilation/cutting ( FGM/C ) has spread in Europe as a result of immigration.
B	Although it is known to have negative health impacts , the exact prevalence of FGM/C and its health effects in Finland are unknown.
B	This study explores the prevalence of FGM/C , the sociodemographic characteristics associated with it , and its health effects among women of Somali and Kurdish origin in Finland.
M	Data were obtained from the Migrant Health and Well Being Study carried out in 2010-2012.
M	This study uses data from interviews with Somali ( N = 165 ) and Kurdish origin ( N = 224 ) women.
M	The participation rate was 37 percent for Somali and 54 percent for Kurdish origin women.
R	The prevalence of FGM/C was 69 percent among those of Somali origin and 32 percent among those of Kurdish origin.
R	Having no education and older age were significantly associated with FGM/C , as was marriage amongst women of Somali origin , and the practice of Islam among women of Kurdish origin.
R	Reporting good self-perceived health was more common among women without FGM/C.
R	Outpatient visits to medical doctors were less common among women of Somali origin with FGM/C , compared with women without FGM/C.
R	About 26 percent of Somali origin and 39 percent of Kurdish origin women with FGM/C reported reproductive or other health problems because of FGM/C.
C	FGM/C is more common in Finland than previously assumed , particularly among women of Kurdish origin.
C	Women with FGM/C need improved access to culturally competent health services to address the health impacts of FGM/C.
C	Education and outreach to immigrant communities to prevent future FGM/C are also urgently needed.

P	Revised You're Welcome ( YW ) quality criteria for adolescent health services were published by the English Department of Health in 2011.
P	These are the first national standards to include inpatient services and the first of their kind to be endorsed by the World Health Organization.
P	This article investigates the relationship between the YW criteria and young people's overall satisfaction in national inpatient surveys.
M	We identified the most recent national surveys that contain adolescent data: the Inpatient Survey ( IS ) 2009 ( ages 16-19 years ) and the Young Patient Survey ( YPS ) 2004 ( ages 12-17 years ).
M	Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of increased overall satisfaction when YW criteria were met , adjusting for sex and use of health services.
M	Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to identify the 10 questions in each survey that best correlated with overall satisfaction.
M	We assessed the degree to which these 10 items were included in the YW criteria.
R	In all , 7 ,657 ( 12-17 years old ) and 988 ( 16-19 years old ) adolescents completed the YPS and the IS , respectively.
R	Twenty-eight of 29 questions that mapped to YW criteria were significantly associated with overall satisfaction ( IS = 14/15 ; YPS = 25/25 ; all p<.01 ).
R	Of the 10 questions that best correlated with overall care rating , 9 mapped directly to YW criteria in the YPS , as did all 10 in the IS.
R	Provider characteristics were the strongest correlates of the overall care rating.
C	Although limited by lack of data relating to access , publicity , and confidentiality , our study provides strong support for the face validity and content validity of the remaining YW quality criteria in inpatient settings.

B	Early-onset bipolar disorder has been associated with a significantly worse prognosis than late-onset BD and has been hypothesized to be a genetically homogenous subset of BD.
B	A sizeable number of studies have investigated early-onset BD through linkage-analyses , candidate-gene association studies , genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) , and analyses of copy number variants ( CNVs ) , but this literature has not yet been reviewed.
M	A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed database on articles published online before January 15 , 2015 and after 1990.
M	Separate searches were made for linkage studies , candidate gene-association studies , GWAS , and studies on CNVs.
R	Seventy-three studies were included in our review.
R	There is a lack of robust positive findings on the genetics of early-onset BD in any major molecular genetics method.
C	Early-onset populations were quite small in some studies.
C	Variance in study methods hindered efforts to interpret results or conduct meta-analysis.
C	The field is still at an early phase for research on early-onset BD.
C	The largely null findings mirror the results of most genetics research on BD.
C	Although most studies were underpowered , the null findings could mean that early-onset BD may not be as genetically homogenous as has been hypothesized or even that early-onset BD does not differ genetically from adult-onset BD.
C	Nevertheless , clinically the probabilistic developmental risk trajectories associated with early-onset that may not be primarily genetically determined continued to warrant scrutiny.
C	Future research should dramatically expand sample sizes , use atheoretical research methods like GWAS , and standardize methods.

P	Under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ; as amended , 2004 ) , speech-language pathology services may be either special education or a related service.
P	Given the absence of guidance documents or research on this issue , the purposes of this clinical exchange are to ( a ) present and analyze the IDEA definitions related to speech-language pathologists ( SLPs ) and their roles , ( b ) offer a rationale for the importance of and distinction between their roles , ( c ) propose an initial conceptualization ( i.e. , flow chart ) to distinguish between when an SLP should function as a related services provider versus a special educator , and ( d ) suggest actions to develop and disseminate a clearer shared understanding of this issue.
M	Federal definitions of special education and related services as related to SLPs are discussed in terms of determining special education eligibility , meeting student needs , ensuring SLPs are following their code of ethics and scope of practice , and facilitating appropriate personnel utilization and service delivery planning.
C	Clarifying the distinction between special education and related services should lead to increased likelihood of appropriate services for students with disabilities , improved working conditions for SLPs , and enhanced collaboration among team members.
C	This clinical exchange is meant to promote dialogue and research about this under-examined issue.
B	Community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) typically defines communities by geography , ethnicity , shared health needs , or some combination.
P	We describe a CBPR project aiming to engage diverse minority and underserved communities throughout Michigan in deliberations about health research priorities.
M	A steering committee ( SC ) with 15 members from minority and underserved communities and 4 members from research organizations led the project , with the help of regional advisory groups ( RAGs ) formed at the SC's request.
M	Evaluation of the SC used questionnaires , focused group discussion , and review of SC meetings to describe engagement , partnership , and communication.
M	Lessons Learned: An academic-community partnership with a diverse , dispersed , and broadly defined community found value in RAGs , dedicated academic staff , face-to-face meetings , varied communication modalities , capacity building tailored to varying levels of CBPR experience , and ongoing evaluation.
C	A geographically and culturally diverse partnership presents challenges and opportunities in representativeness , relationship building , capacity building , and communication.
P	To describe mortality from suicide in Brazil , with emphasis on the older adult population.
M	Temporal analysis and trend analysis by polynomial regression were conducted on suicide in the population above 10 years old in Brazil and the State of Rio de Janeiro ( Southeastern Brazil ) from 1980-2006.
M	The data were extracted from the Mortality Information System , and the rates calculated by gender and age per 100 ,000 inhabitants , considering the resident population provided by DATASUS.
M	For the period between 1980 and 1995 , the ninth revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems was used , and for 1996 to 2006 , the tenth revision.
R	Suicide rates significantly increased in Brazil and in Rio de Janeiro ( respectively reaching 5.7 and 3.1 deaths per 100 ,000 inhabitants in 2006 ).
R	The change was caused by the increase in suicides among the male population at all ages.
R	The increase occurred especially among men over 60 years.
R	In Rio de Janeiro , the increase was not statistically significant among men , while there was a decrease among women.
R	The principal means utilized for suicide by men were hanging , suffocation , strangulation and firearms.
R	For women , death by hanging also ranks first , followed by ingestion of solids or liquids , smoke or fire , and jumping from heights.
R	The high rate of suicide by unspecified means reveals problems with data quality.
C	Suicides are important events in the male population , especially among older men over time.
C	In Rio de Janeiro , the suicide rate is also higher in men , although the difference is not statistically significant.
C	According to the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health , suicide is preventable , and established interventions exist for each age group.
P	Emotional regulation of preschool children who stutter ( CWS ) and children who do not stutter ( CWNS ) was assessed through use of a disappointing gift ( DG ) procedure ( P. M. Cole , 1986 ; C. Saarni , 1984 , 1992 ).
M	Participants consisted of 16 CWS and CWNS ( 11 boys and 5 girls in each talker group ) who were 3 to 5 years of age.
M	After assessing each child's knowledge of display rules about socially appropriate expression of emotions , the authors asked the children to participate in a DG procedure.
M	The children received a desirable gift preceding the first free-play task and a disappointing gift preceding a second free-play task.
M	Dependent variables consisted of participants' positive and negative expressive nonverbal behaviors exhibited during receipt of a desirable gift and disappointing gift as well as conversational speech disfluencies exhibited following receipt of each gift.
R	Findings indicated that CWS and CWNS exhibited no significant differences in amount of positive emotional expressions after receiving the desired gift ; however , CWS-when compared with CWNS-exhibited more negative emotional expressions after receiving the undesirable gift.
R	Furthermore , CWS were more disfluent after receiving the desired gift than after receiving the disappointing gift.
R	Ancillary findings also indicated that CWS and CWNS had equivalent knowledge of display rules.
C	Findings suggest that efforts to concurrently regulate emotional behaviors and that speech disfluencies may be problematic for preschool-age CWS.
B	Assessment of physical access to health services is extremely important for planning.
B	Complex methods that incorporate data inputs from road networks and transport systems are used to assess physical access to healthcare in industrialised countries.
B	However , such data inputs hardly exist in many developing countries.
B	Straight-line distances between the service provider and resident population are easily obtained but their relationship with driving distance and travel time is unclear.
B	This study aimed to investigate the relationship between different measures of physical access , including straight-line distances , road distances and travel time and the impact of these measures on the vaccination of children in Yemen.
M	Coordinates of houses and health facilities were determined by GPS machine in Urban and rural areas in Taiz province , Yemen.
M	Road distances were measured by an odometer of a vehicle driven from participants' houses to the nearest health centre.
M	Driving time was measured using a stop-watch.
M	Data on children's vaccination were collected by personal interview and verified by inspecting vaccination cards.
R	There was a strong correlation between straight-line distances , driving distances and driving time ( straight line distances vs. driving distance r = 0.92 , p < 0.001 , straight line distances vs. driving time r = 0.75 ; p < 0.001 , driving distance vs. driving time r = 0.83 , p < 0.001 ).
R	Each measure of physical accessibility showed strong association with vaccination of children after adjusting for socio-economic status.
C	Straight-line distances , driving distances and driving time are strongly linked and associated with vaccination uptake.
C	Straight-line distances can be used to assess physical access to health services where data inputs on road networks and transport are lacking.
C	Impact of physical access is clear in Yemen , highlighting the need for efforts to target vaccination and other preventive healthcare measures to children who live away from health facilities.
B	Caring for a relative with dementia has been associated with high levels of psychological morbidity in carers.
B	Sense of coherence is an important resource of successful coping with caregiving.
B	The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between stress associated with caregiving , sense of coherence , and self-reported depression and anxiety in family carers of people with dementia.
B	We hypothesized that carers reporting high levels of anxiety and depression will report low levels of coherence , and that the relationship between caregiver stress and affective symptoms will be mediated by sense of coherence.
M	A total of 170 carers of people with dementia took part in the present study.
M	Family carers completed the Sense of Coherence Scale , the Relative Stress Scale , and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
M	A series of multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine the relationship between stress related to caregiving , caregiver anxiety and depression , and whether sense of coherence mediated this relationship.
R	Self-reported anxiety and depression were associated with low levels of sense of coherence.
R	Sense of coherence mediated the relationship between burden and self-reported depressive effect and anxiety symptoms.
C	Carers reporting high levels of anxiety and depression are more likely to report low levels of sense of coherence.
C	The relationship between stress related to caregiving and depressive symptoms is mediated by carers' self-reported sense of coherence.
C	Future psychotherapeutic intervention studies in family carers of people with dementia may incorporate strategies that specifically target sense of coherence.
B	Physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease , diabetes and all-cause mortality.
B	Patients with depression are less likely to be physically active , and thus more prone to developing these diseases.
B	The aim of this study was to identify patient and study characteristics associated with adherence to exercise interventions.
M	We pooled data from patients allocated to active exercise interventions from two previously conducted exercise trials ( n = 166 ) offering two or three weekly sessions.
M	We divided the patients into a high attendance or a low attendance group.
M	We then compared patient characteristics , distance to training facilities , depression , anxiety , and satisfaction with the offered intervention between the two groups.
R	High attendance was positively associated with age ( p = 0.05 ) and satisfaction with the intervention ( p < 0.001 ).
R	We found no association between attendance and any other patient characteristics , severity of depression , severity of anxiety , or distance to training facilities.
R	Patient satisfaction was positively associated with the patient's age ( p = 0.008 ) and improvement in depression ( p = 0.04 ).
R	Median attendance did not differ between the two trials offering two or three sessions per week ( p = 0.44 ).
C	Severity of depression or anxiety in mild to moderate depression did not predict attendance , but high attendance was associated with higher age and satisfaction with the intervention.
C	These findings suggest that motivational focus on younger participants should be encouraged and ways to improve satisfaction with the intervention should be considered.

P	The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of four different front-of-package ( FOP ) labelling systems on consumer perception and purchasing intent of food , and whether these systems help consumers select a balanced pattern of eating.
M	The four FOP labelling systems studied included two nutrient-specific systems.
M	the Traffic Light ( TL ) and the Guideline Daily Amount ( GDA ).
M	and two summary indicator systems - NuVal ( R ) and My-5 ( R ).
M	Phase 1 was a small study with 36 participants to determine consumer understanding of the four FOP labelling systems and to inform the development of the questions for Phase 2 , which consisted of a survey of 2 ,200 adults obtained through an online panel.
R	Although the TL and GDA were rated similar to the Nutrition Facts table in terms of attributes , these FOP systems were considered more visually appealing.
R	Consumers indicated that the numeric summary indicator systems did not provide sufficient information.
R	Approximately half of the respondents indicated that the FOP systems would help them make healthier choices.
R	However , due to the limitations of each , consumers often misinterpreted a food's healthiness compared to their baseline perceptions.
R	Similarly , consumers' intent to purchase based on the FOP system did not show a consistent pattern.
C	Although well received by consumers , FOP labelling systems can lead to confusion depending on perceived understanding of the system used.
C	The nutrient-specific systems tend to be preferred by most consumers ; however , the overall impact on selecting healthier eating patterns has yet to be demonstrated.
P	To compare the use of disease and injury classification codes in workplace absences requests due to dental causes.
M	The study analyzed 240 requests in a federal public agency between January 2008 and December 2009.
M	The use of the International Classification of Diseases - 10th Revision ( ICD-10 ) was compared to the Application of the International Classification of Diseases to Dentistry and Stomatology ( ICD-DA ).
M	The degree of specificity was determined for the codifications on workplace justifications , as well as for codifications assigned by official dental experts in indirect inspections and expert examinations.
R	Of the total number of dental certificates , 22.9% did not present the ICD , 7.1% used ICD-9 , 3.3% used ICD-DA and 66.7% used ICD-10.
R	The majority of codifications were concordant ( 55.1% ) , and greater specificity was found in codifications assigned after evaluation by official dental experts.
C	The results indicate the need to improve use of ICD-10 among dentists and official dental experts.
C	For analysis of work absenteeism , it is suggested the use of ICD-DA and the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health , which provide relevant data for monitoring absenteeism due to dental reasons.
B	Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT-E ) ( Fairburn , Cooper and Shafran , 2003 ) was developed as a treatment approach for eating disorders focusing on both core psychopathology and additional maintenance mechanisms.
P	To evaluate treatment outcomes associated with CBT-E in a NHS Eating Disorders Service for adults with bulimia and atypical eating disorders and to make comparisons with a previously published randomized controlled trial ( Fairburn et al. , 2009 ) and real world evaluation ( Byrne , Fursland , Allen and Watson , 2011 ).
M	Participants were referred to the eating disorder service between 2002 and 2011.
M	They were aged between 18-65 years , registered with a General Practitioner within the catchment area , and had experienced symptoms fulfilling criteria for BN or EDNOS for a minimum of 6 months.
R	CBT-E was commenced by 272 patients , with 135 completing treatment.
R	Overall , treatment was associated with significant improvements in eating disorder and associated psychopathology , for both treatment completers and the intention to treat sample.
C	Findings support dissemination of CBT-E in this context , with significant improvements in eating disorder psychopathology.
C	Improvements to global EDE-Q scores were higher for treatment completers and lower for the intention to treat sample , compared to previous studies ( Fairburn et al. , 2009 ; Byrne et al. , 2011 ).
C	Level of attrition was found at 40.8% and non-completion of treatment was associated with higher levels of anxiety.
C	Potential explanations for these findings are discussed.
P	Engagement with culture as a facet of the work of schools and colleges has been evident since at least the 1950s.
P	The 21st-century interest in culture remains strong , in part because of the growing sense that education faces a scenario where the scale of technological , economic , and social change is unprecedented.
P	Such change demands revisiting cultural values , as practice and power relations are disturbed both by change itself and an inability to assimilate it.
P	The article revisits a seminal question-how far should educational leaders engage with culture as a key theoretical construct , and what are the moral and pragmatic issues that arise?
M	The article charts the engagement of the field of educational leadership with culture over time.
M	It critically reviews some of the theoretical models that have been used as analytical and interpretative lenses , considers the scope of the evidence for the utility of the concept of culture , and then explores related implicit and explicit power relations embedded in school leaders' engagement with culture.
R	The article concludes that a renewed and more rigorous but critical engagement with culture is essential both for theorizing leadership and developing the leaders of schools , colleges , and universities in the future.
B	This study proposes to describe family members in the city of Sao Paulo who are seeking support in mutual self-help groups to deal with a substance misusing relative.
M	Five hundred participants ( one participant per family ) completed a structured questionnaire collecting socio-demographic information , length of time taken to seek help , and where they sought help.
M	Participants were recruited from the mutual self-help group 'Amor Exigente' in the city of Sao Paulo , Brazil.
R	Parents of substance misusers counted as the largest group of family members.
R	It took an average time of 3.7 years for the family members to discover their relatives' substance misuse.
R	42% had then sought help immediately ; it took an average of 2.6 years for the remaining 58% of the sample to seek some form of support.
R	A belief that the substance misuse of their relatives was just a transient problem or that they could cope with the situation by themselves were among the most indicated reasons for delay in seeking help.
C	Findings stress the importance of implementing services that take into account the difficulties families have in finding help to deal with the substance misusing relative.

P	The purpose of this study was to conduct a curriculum scan of Canadian undergraduate university programs to determine the relative emphasis placed on the activity and exercise after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , in the context of physical disability studies.
M	Eighty-three Canadian Universities were evaluated for courses discussing: ( i ) general information about SCI , ( ii ) physical activity and exercise after SCI , ( iii ) general information about other physical disabilities and ( iv ) physical activity and exercise for such disabilities.
M	Online course calendars ( 2009 ) were scanned , and their accuracy was verified by instructors or administrative assistants.
R	The curriculum scan revealed 113 courses that discuss physical disability.
R	Seventy-four of these courses cover information regarding SCI , 47 of which include content relating to activity and exercise.
R	In comparison , 104 courses discuss other physical disabilities , 76 of which cover material related to activity and exercise.
R	Further , the 47 courses that cover activity and exercise after SCI are only offered in 22 Canadian Universities , and only 31 are mandatory for a degree.
C	A substantial number of future healthcare professionals lack exposure to material regarding activity and exercise after SCI during their undergraduate education.
C	This curricular oversight likely contributes to ineffective exercise strategies and the relative inactivity of the SCI population.
B	Very old individuals seem to present an admirable capacity to overcome adversities and adapt to the challenges of advanced age.
B	However , studies focusing successful pattern of centenarians found that they may easily fail to be categorized as successful agers when objective criteria are applied.
B	The present study examines if centenarians can be considered successful agers.
B	Following Rowe and Kahn's successful aging model , the primary goal was to clarify whether centenarians are able to be successful agers according to objective and subjective criteria of no major disease and disability , high cognitive and physical functioning and engagement with life.
B	The second goal was to investigate whether socio-demographic factors , psychological , social , and economic resources are related to objective and subjective successful aging profiles.
M	We examined different profiles of successful aging in a high selected sample of individuals aged 100 and more years old from the population-based Oporto Centenarian Study.
R	Main findings reveal that centenarians do not represent the prototype of successful aging , but self-ratings demonstrate that many of them feel successful , despite not being objectively considered as so.
R	Those who were considered successful agers presented higher values of self-efficacy , hope , and purpose in life , as well as few difficulties in covering financial expenses.
C	As a basis for strengthening the existing model , the value of subjectivity should be explored and psychological resources promoted in interventions to foster positive adaptation in very old age.
P	To assess the role of interaural time differences and interaural level differences in ( a ) sound-source localization , and ( b ) speech understanding in a cocktail party listening environment for listeners with bilateral cochlear implants ( CIs ) and for listeners with hearing-preservation CIs.
M	Eleven bilateral listeners with MED-EL ( Durham , NC ) CIs and 8 listeners with hearing-preservation CIs with symmetrical low frequency , acoustic hearing using the MED-EL or Cochlear device were evaluated using 2 tests designed to task binaural hearing , localization , and a simulated cocktail party.
M	Access to interaural cues for localization was constrained by the use of low-pass , highpass , and wideband noise stimuli.
R	Sound-source localization accuracy for listeners with bilateral CIs in response to the high-pass noise stimulus and sound-source localization accuracy for the listeners with hearing-preservation CIs in response to the low-pass noise stimulus did not differ significantly.
R	Speech understanding in a cocktail party listening environment improved for all listeners when interaural cues , either interaural time difference or interaural level difference , were available.
C	The findings of the current study indicate that similar degrees of benefit to sound-source localization and speech understanding in complex listening environments are possible with 2 very different rehabilitation strategies: the provision of bilateral CIs and the preservation of hearing.
B	The long-term evolution of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes ( EPS ) of Parkinsonism , akathisia and tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) is still a controversial issue worth exploring.
M	A total of 200 inpatients on regular typical neuroleptics ( NL ) and/or clozapine were assessed in 1995 with regard to the prevalence of EPS.
M	Altogether , 83 patients could be reassessed in 2003/04 ( 63 had died ) using the same methods.
M	Strict definitions of EPS were used.
M	The complete account of NL therapy the patients were prescribed between 1995 and 2003/04 ( including atypical NL other than clozapine ) was considered.
R	The prevalences found in 1995 and 2003/04 were 17% and 29% for Parkinsonism , 14% and 14% for akathisia , and 24% and 13% for TD.
R	There were considerable intra-individual fluctuations in EPS occurrence even when the overall prevalence rate remained the same.
R	in intra-individual comparisons of EPS ratings on both assessments , there was a tendency for worsening of Parkinsonism to be associated with a current ( 2003/04 ) therapy with typical NL ; worsening of akathisia was associated with a current therapy with atypical NL other than clozapine , amelioration of akathisia with a current therapy with clozapne ; and , basically , there were no significant associations found between the changes in TD ratings and the long-term therapy with typical NL , clozapine , and other atypical NL , considering cumulative doses of all these drugs.
R	In a multivariate analysis , there was a tendency for the long-term evolution of TD to depend on illness duration as the only variable.
C	There are intra-individual fluctuations in all EPS over longer time periods.
C	The choice of current NL therapy has an impact on Parkinsonism and akathisia.
C	The long-term evolution of TD appears independent of NL prescriptions.

B	A growing literature describes the participation of children with disability , but less is known about the effect of disability type , severity and environmental factors on participation.
P	To investigate the extent , context , experience and preferences for participation in out-of-school activities among children with disability in Victoria , Australia.
M	Two-hundred and eighty-six children ( 177 boys , 109 girls ; mean age 11.5 years ) with physical ( n = 77 ) , intellectual ( n = 67 ) , multiple ( n = 93 ) , and other disabilities ( n = 49 ) took part.
M	Data were collected using the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment ( CAPE ) and Preferences for Activities of Children ( PAC ) questionnaires.
R	Children with disability participated in 28 out of 55 activities ( SD 6 activities ) , 2-3 times per month , on average.
R	Preference was the most important predictor of participation diversity for all activity types.
R	Disability type was a predictor of participation diversity in active-physical activities only.
R	Severity was a predictor of participation diversity overall , and of participation in formal and informal activities.
R	Age , severity and preference accounted for almost 50% of the variance of diversity of recreational activities.
C	These results underscore the importance of taking a child's activity preferences into account when implementing interventions to increase participation in out-of-school activities.

B	The health status of children in the Iran has improved in many areas such as lower rates of infectious diseases and declines in malnutrition.
B	However rapid lifestyle changes might make them prone to chronic diseases in adulthood.
B	Because of the importance of collecting national information about related risk behaviors and risk factors , this national project was conducted for the first time in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
M	The baseline survey was conducted among 21111 school students aged 6-18 years , and their parents living in 23 provinces ; biochemical tests were obtained from 481 1 students.
R	Underweight and overweight had similar prevalence ( 13.9% underweight , 13.4% overweight ).
R	The most prevalent type of dyslipidemia was low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia.
R	In addition to providing national percentiles and reference curves for weight , height and body mass index , this study provided the first reference curves for waist circumference and blood pressure of children , as well as the first national prevalence of pediatric metabolic syndrome in Asia.
R	Unhealthy nutrition and low physical activity were associated with most risk factors.
C	Close monitoring of children and adolescents for risk factors and risk behaviors should be considered as a public health priority , thus a national school-based surveillance program is being established in this regard in Iran.
B	Colombia is one of the countries with the widest levels of socioeconomic and health inequalities.
B	Bogota , its capital , faces serious problems of poverty , social disparities and access to health services.
B	A Primary Health Care ( PHC ) strategy was implemented in 2004 to improve health care and to address the social determinants of such inequalities.
B	This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of the PHC strategy to reducing inequalities in child health outcomes in Bogota.
M	An ecological analysis with localities as the unit of analysis was carried out.
M	The variable used to capture the socioeconomic status and living standards was the Quality of Life Index ( QLI ).
M	Concentration curves and concentration indices for four child health outcomes ( infant mortality rate ( IMR ) , under-5 mortality rate , prevalence of acute malnutrition in children under-5 , and vaccination coverage for diphtheria , pertussis and tetanus ) were calculated to measure socioeconomic inequality.
M	Two periods were used to describe possible changes in the magnitude of the inequalities related with the PHC implementation ( 2003 year before - 2007 year after implementation ).
M	The contribution of the PHC intervention was computed by a decomposition analysis carried out on data from 2007.
R	In both 2003 and 2007 , concentration curves and indexes of IMR , under-5 mortality rate and acute malnutrition showed inequalities to the disadvantage of localities with lower QLI.
R	Diphtheria , pertussis and tetanus ( DPT ) vaccinations were more prevalent among localities with higher QLI in 2003 but were higher in localities with lower QLI in 2007.
R	The variation of the concentration index between 2003 and 2007 indicated reductions in inequality for all of the indicators in the period after the PHC implementation.
R	In 2007 , PHC was associated with a reduction in the effect of the inequality that affected disadvantaged localities in under-5 mortality ( 24% ) , IMR ( 19% ) and acute malnutrition ( 7% ).
R	PHC also contributed approximately 20% to inequality in DPT coverage , favoring the poorer localities.
C	The PHC strategy developed in Bogota appears to be contributing to reductions of the inequality associated with socioeconomic and living conditions in child health outcomes.
B	Human trafficking and labor exploitation are prevalent in Southeast Asia and have substantial health consequences for children and adolescents.
B	Research on pre-departure circumstances and trafficking experiences show that gender plays a key role in shaping the experience of exploited children and adolescents.
P	This study estimates how youth's concerns and hopes for the future influence the mental health outcomes of male and female children and adolescents.
P	Participants and
M	Data were collected in face-to-face interviews with 517 children and adolescents ( 10-19 years old ) who attended post-trafficking services between year 2010 and year 2013 in Cambodia , Thailand or Vietnam.
M	Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association of children and adolescents' post-trafficking concerns and hopes for the future with mental health outcomes , namely symptoms of depression , anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ).
M	The analysis was stratified by sex.
R	In adjusted analysis , children and adolescents' concerns about social ostracization and maltreatment by others in their community of origin were associated with all three outcomes in males and with depression in females.
R	Being concerned about their own mental health was associated with all outcomes , with a potentially stronger effect observed in males for depression ( AOR 9.14 , CI:1.21-68.68 ) , anxiety ( AOR 13.47 , CI:1.70-106.48 ) and PTSD ( AOR 8.36 , CI:1.22-56.9 ) than in females where the odds for depression ( AOR 3.24 , CI:1.92-5.48 ) , anxiety ( AOR 3.05 , CI:1.82-5.11 ) and PTSD ( AOR 1.85 , CI:1.08-3.14 ) were much lower.
C	Young people's post-trafficking care needs and reintegration planning should be designed based on their current mental health , personal security , family and financial resources and age-related capacity.
B	Preclinical and clinical research suggest that the alpha( 1 ) receptor antagonist prazosin reduces alcohol consumption.
B	Furthermore , clinical studies indicate a role for prazosin in treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms and a recent trial suggested that pre-treatment blood pressure ( BP ) predicts therapeutic response for prazosin in PTSD patients.
B	Whether pre-treatment BP may predict response to alpha( 1 ) blockers in alcohol-dependent ( AD ) patients is unknown.
B	We previously reported a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) where doxazosin , an alpha( 1 ) receptor antagonist with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than prazosin , reduced drinks per week ( DPW ) and heavy drinking days ( HDD ) in AD patients with a high family history density of alcoholism.
B	In this study , we tested pre-treatment BP as another potentially valuable clinical moderator of doxazosin's response on alcohol consumption.
M	This was a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT testing doxazosin up to 16 mg/day in AD treatment seeking patients ( N = 41 ).
M	The hypothesized moderator effect of baseline standing systolic and diastolic BP on DPW and HDD was tested.
R	With pre-treatment standing diastolic BP as a moderator , there were significant BP x medication interactions for both DPW [( star star )p = 0.009 , d = 0.80] and HDD [( star )p = 0.018 , d = 1.11].
R	Post-hoc analyses indicated significant doxazosin effects in patients with higher standing BP in reducing both DPW and HDD.
C	These findings suggest that higher standing diastolic BP at baseline ( pre-treatment ) may represent a predictor of doxazosin's response on alcohol consumption in AD patients.
C	These results further elucidate the possible efficacy and mechanisms of action of alpha( 1 ) receptor antagonism in AD individuals.
B	Although research on the developmental antecedents of sexual offending has tended to focus on sexual abuse , recent research in juveniles and adults who have sexually offended suggests that psychological abuse perpetrated by a male caregiver may be a particularly important factor in the development of problematic sexual interests and behaviors.
P	This study aimed to extend previous findings by investigating the association between psychological abuse by a male caregiver and problematic sexual outcomes in a sample of adult males who had sexually offended.
M	Participants were 529 adult males incarcerated for sexual offenses , 21% of whom were civilly committed.
M	Childhood maltreatment and problematic sexual outcomes were assessed using the Multidimensional Assessment of Sex and Aggression , a contingency-based inventory that assesses domains related to sexual aggression.
M	Hierarchical regressions were calculated examining the association between childhood abuse types and sexual outcomes.
R	Childhood sexual abuse was associated with child sexual ( beta =.247 , p < .001 ) and other paraphilic interests ( beta = .189 , p < .001 ).
R	Male caregiver psychological abuse also emerged as marginally associated with child sexual interest ( beta = .100 , p = .059 ) , even after controlling for other abuse types.
C	These results partially replicate recent findings in a juvenile sample and challenge conventional developmental theories of sexual offending , by suggesting that male caregiver psychological abuse may play a role in the etiology of child sexual interest among males who have sexually offended.
C	This study also suggests a possible gender symmetry effect moderating the developmental consequences of abuse.
B	Organizational resilience refers to the ability to respond productively to significant disruptive change and transform challenges into opportunities.
B	There is a gap in the literature about resilient nonprofit organizations and its application for identifying organizational conditions for successful adaption to external variables that threaten their existence.
P	The aim of this study was to identify organizational characteristics that point to the resilience of nonprofit behavioral healthcare organizations as they successfully adapt to funding changes.
M	A multiple case study of two behavioral health nonprofit organizations was conducted.
M	Data was collected through interviews and focus groups , and analyzed through a qualitative content analysis.
R	Using the framework of resilience , six themes that equipped these organizations to successfully adapt to funding changes were identified.
R	They included: commitment to the mission , improvisation , community reciprocity , servant and transformational leadership , hope and optimism , and fiscal transparency.
C	The findings suggest that incorporating these qualities into an organizational system equips it to systematically adapt to funding changes and other disruptive challenges.
C	Using resilience as a process and not simply an outcome after recovery , nonprofit organizations can have the capacity to continuously respond to challenges and provide uninterrupted and valuable services to society.
B	A huge number of patients with self-harm and suicide attempt visit emergency departments ( EDs ).
B	We systematically reviewed studies and examined the effect of interventions to prevent repeat suicidal behavior in patients admitted to EDs for a suicidal attempt.
M	We searched the databases of MEDLINE , PsychoINFO , CINAHL , and EMBASE through August 2013.
M	Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials assessing the effects on repeat suicidal behavior of interventions initiated in suicidal patients admitted to EDs.
M	Interventions in each trial were classified into groups by consensus.
M	Meta-analyses were performed to determine pooled relative risks ( RRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( Os ) of repetition of suicide attempt for interventions in each group.
R	Out of 5390 retrieved articles , 24 trials were included and classified into four groups ( 11 trials in the Active contact and follow-up , nine in the Psychotherapy , one in the Pharmacotherapy , and three in the Miscellaneous ).
R	Active contact and follow-up type interventions were effective in preventing a repeat suicide within 12 months ( n=5319 ; pooled RR-0 ,83 ; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.97 ).
R	However , the effect at 24 months was not confirmed ( n=925 ; pooled RR=0.98 ; 95% Cl: 0.76-1.22 ).
R	The effects of the other interventions on preventing a repetition of suicidal behavior remain unclear.
C	Caution is needed regarding the heterogeneity of the effects.
C	Interventions of active contact and follow-up are recommended to reduce the risk of a repeat suicide attempt at 12 months in patients admitted to EDs with a suicide attempt.
C	However , the long-term effect was not confirmed.

B	Smoking is one of the major risk factors for oral diseases , and many studies have found that active smoking is closely associated with the prevalence or severity of periodontal disease and fewer remaining teeth.
B	In contrast to the established association between active smoking and oral health , there have been very few studies investigating the effects of secondhand smoking on oral health , and whether secondhand smoking deteriorates oral health has not been fully clarified.
B	The purpose of the present study was to examine whether active and secondhand smoking were associated with the prevalence of severe periodontal disease and number of teeth among Japanese adults.
M	Subjects were 1 ,164 dentate adults aged 55-75 years as of May 2005 who participated in both the Japan Public Health Center-Based Study Cohort I in 1990 and a dental survey in 2005.
M	The dental survey was implemented in the Yokote health center jurisdiction , Akita Prefecture.
M	Participating subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire and a clinical oral examination.
M	The association of smoking status with prevalence of periodontal disease was analyzed using a logistic regression , and with number of teeth or functional tooth units of natural teeth ( n-FTUs ) using a generalized linear model.
R	After adjusting for age , education level , history of diabetes , BMI , alcohol consumption , perceived mental stress , presence of a family dentist , and oral hygiene , the odds ratio ( OR ) of risk for periodontal disease in male subjects was significantly increased in non-smokers with secondhand smoking only at home ( OR = 3.14 , 95 % CI: 1.08-9.12 , p = 0.036 ) , non-smokers with secondhand smoking both at home and other places ( OR = 3.61 , 95 % CI: 1.33-9.81 , p = 0.012 ) and current smokers ( OR = 3.31 , 95 % CI: 1.54-7.08 , p = 0.002 ) , compared to non-smokers without secondhand smoking.
R	Further in men , current smokers had significantly fewer numbers of teeth ( 19.7 +/- 6.82 ) and n-FTUs ( 4.92 +/- 4.12 ) than non-smokers without secondhand smoking ( 22.2 +/- 6.92 , p = 0.014 and 6.56 +/- 4.18 , p = 0.007 ).
R	Such significant relationships of smoking status with periodontal disease and dentition were not observed in women.
C	The present study indicates that active smoking as well as secondhand smoking may have harmful effects on periodontal health in men.
C	Therefore , it is imperative for health and oral health professionals to enlighten people about the negative influence of smoking , not only on their own health but also on others' health.
B	This is the first study to use meta-analysis as a scientific technique to provide an integrated analysis of the effectiveness of music intervention in cancer patients.
P	The purpose of this study was , using the meta-analysis method , to present a summary of existing research and explore the effectiveness of music intervention in ameliorating anxiety , depression , pain , and fatigue in cancer patients.
M	The present study collected quantitative study designs sought of music intervention for cancer patients published from 2002 to 2012.
M	These studies were then cross-referenced using Medical Subject Headings for topics on music intervention and cancer patients.
M	Outcome indicators were anxiety , depression , pain , and fatigue.
M	The quality of the studies was evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines.
M	The effect size on outcome indicators used the formula devised by Hedges and Olkin ( 1985 ).
R	Results showed that music interventions were significantly effective in ameliorating anxiety ( g = -0.553 ) , depression ( g = -0.510 ) , pain ( g = -0.656 ) , and fatigue ( g = -0.422 ) in cancer patients.
R	Subgroup analyses revealed that age and who selected the music were major factors influencing the effect size on anxiety reduction.
C	Music interventions significantly ameliorate anxiety , depression , pain , and fatigue in cancer patients , especially adults.
C	Music interventions were more effective in adults than in children or adolescents and more effective when patients , rather than researchers , chose the music.
C	Our findings provide important information for future music-intervention planners to improve the design and processes that will benefit patients in such programs.
B	It is well documented that the translation of knowledge into clinical practice is a slow and haphazard process.
B	This is no less true for dental healthcare than other types of healthcare.
B	One common policy strategy to help promote knowledge translation is the production of clinical guidance , but it has been demonstrated that the simple publication of guidance is unlikely to optimise practice.
B	Additional knowledge translation interventions have been shown to be effective , but effectiveness varies and much of this variation is unexplained.
B	The need for researchers to move beyond single studies to develop a generalisable , theory based , knowledge translation framework has been identified.
B	For dentistry in Scotland , the production of clinical guidance is the responsibility of the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme ( SDCEP ).
B	TRiaDS ( Translation Research in a Dental Setting ) is a multidisciplinary research collaboration , embedded within the SDCEP guidance development process , which aims to establish a practical evaluative framework for the translation of guidance and to conduct and evaluate a programme of integrated , multi-disciplinary research to enhance the science of knowledge translation.
M	Set in General Dental Practice the TRiaDS programmatic evaluation employs a standardised process using optimal methods and theory.
M	For each SDCEP guidance document a diagnostic analysis is undertaken alongside the guidance development process.
M	Information is gathered about current dental care activities.
M	Key recommendations and their required behaviours are identified and prioritised.
M	Stakeholder questionnaires and interviews are used to identify and elicit salient beliefs regarding potential barriers and enablers towards the key recommendations and behaviours.
M	Where possible routinely collected data are used to measure compliance with the guidance and to inform decisions about whether a knowledge translation intervention is required.
M	Interventions are theory based and informed by evidence gathered during the diagnostic phase and by prior published evidence.
M	They are evaluated using a range of experimental and quasi-experimental study designs , and data collection continues beyond the end of the intervention to investigate the sustainability of an intervention effect.
C	The TRiaDS programmatic approach is a significant step forward towards the development of a practical , generalisable framework for knowledge translation research.
C	The multidisciplinary composition of the TRiaDS team enables consideration of the individual , organisational and system determinants of professional behaviour change.
C	In addition the embedding of TRiaDS within a national programme of guidance development offers a unique opportunity to inform and influence the guidance development process , and enables TRiaDS to inform dental services practitioners , policy makers and patients on how best to translate national recommendations into routine clinical activities.
B	Management of patients with mental disorders is inadequate in the majority of low and middle income countries.
B	The main treatment modality for patients with severe mental disorders in these countries is mainly pharmacological approach.
B	Patients face many challenges in meeting medication needs.
B	In this context , high percentages of individuals who have severe mental disorders are not treated.
B	Regular and adequate supplies of appropriate , safe and affordable medications are some of the important aspects required for provision of quality mental health services.
B	Psychotropic medications are an important component of holistic care that provides treatment options for those suffering from mental illnesses.
B	In Tanzania , mental health services face many challenges including inadequate mental health care providers , infrastructure , and medication supply.
B	Relapse is a common problem among patients attending mental health facilities.
B	This study is aimed at exploring views and experiences of patients , caregivers and mental health care providers on the psychotropic medication in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania
M	A qualitative study was conducted , involving two focus group discussions with seven and nine caregivers in each group.
M	Eleven in-depth interviews with four patients and seven mental health care providers at Temeke Municipality , Dar es Salaam , were conducted.
M	Convenient sampling procedure was used to select participants for the study.
M	Discussion and interview guides were used during data collection.
M	Interviews were audio-recorded in Kiswahili with all study participants.
M	The recorded interviews were transcribed and qualitative content thematic analysis was used to analyze data after translation.
R	Four themes were identified.
R	These include attitudes of patients towards psychotropic medication , availability of psychotropic medications , financial concerns towards psychotropic medications , and coverage of free treatment policy.
C	The availability and affordability of psychotropic medications to patients are big problems.
C	This was partly attributed to insufficient funds to support the budget of health facilities and technical challenges contributed by both the health facilities and other stakeholders.
C	To improve mental health services in the country , it is important to ensure adequate supply of psychotropic medications in the health facilities.
C	Access to psychotropic medications is essential in addressing the public health problem of untreated mental illnesses.
C	These findings call for the government and other stakeholders to increase funding for essential psychotropic medications.
B	We evaluated the effectiveness of a transtheoretical model ( TTM )-based passive smoking prevention programme developed to enhance passive smoking avoidance among pregnant women and women with young children in Taiwan.
M	Subjects were pregnant women recruited from the obstetrics/gynaecology department and women with children younger than age 3 recruited from the paediatrics department of four hospitals in Taiwan.
M	Participants were randomly assigned to a group receiving a TTM-based intervention programme or a comparison group receiving routine care.
M	The intervention programme consisted of educational materials and phone counselling.
M	Baseline assessment and post-test data were collected from both groups using a self-reported questionnaire developed based on stages of change related to readiness for passive smoking avoidance.
R	Determinants of change , post-test scores of knowledge , experiential and behavioural processes and self-efficacy were significantly different between the intervention group and comparison group among both pregnant women and mothers.
R	Among pregnant women , the intervention group had significantly higher post-test scores than the comparison group.
R	The distribution of percentages in three stages of change ( Precontemplation , Contemplation/Preparation and Action/Maintenance ) was significantly different between the two groups among both pregnant women and mothers.
R	However , a higher percentage of mothers made progress in stages of change compared with pregnant women.
C	A TTM-based intervention programme was potentially effective in passive smoking prevention by improving knowledge , experiential and behavioural processes and self-efficacy among pregnant women and women with young children.
C	A higher percentage of mothers with young children had progressed in stages of change post-intervention compared with pregnant women.
B	Thailand is undergoing a health-risk transition with overweight and obesity emerging as an important population health problem.
B	This paper reports on a study of the transition , focusing on "lifestyle'' factors such as diet ( fried foods , soft drinks , Western-style fast foods ) and physical activity ( mild , moderate , strenuous exercise , housework/gardening and screen time ).
M	A baseline survey was administered to 87 134 adult students from all regions of Thailand attending an open university.
R	54% of the cohort was female.
R	Participants' median age was 29 years.
R	By self-reported Asian standards , 16% of the sample was obese ( body mass index ( BMI )>= 25 ) and 15% overweight at risk ( BMI >= 23-24.9 ).
R	Men were twice as likely as women to be overweight ( 21% vs 9% ) or obese ( 23% vs 10% ).
R	Obesity was associated with urban residence and doing little housework or gardening and with spending more than 4 hours a day watching television or using computers.
R	The latter occurred among 30% of the cohort , with a population attributable fraction ( PAF ) suggesting that it accounts for 11% of the current problem.
R	Daily consumption of fried food was associated with obesity , and eating fried foods every second day or daily had a PAF of nearly 20%.
C	These health-related behaviours underpinning the Thai health transition are associated with increasing obesity.
C	They are modifiable through policies addressing structural issues and with targeted health promotion activities to prevent future obesity gains.
C	Insights into future trends in the Thai health transition can be gained as this student cohort ages.
B	Stuttering and speech sound disorder may co-occur during early childhood , although the exact rate of comorbidity in a community-cohort sample remains unknown.
B	In isolation , both disorders have the potential for long-term negative effects.
B	Comorbidity rates of 16%-46% reported in previous studies were based on parent report , speech-language therapist surveys , case file audits or direct observation studies from clinical samples.
B	Rigorous methodology utilising a prospective , longitudinal community-cohort design is required to support these previous findings.
P	First , to identify the proportion of children with comorbid stuttering and speech sound disorder at 4 years of age drawn from a community-cohort study.
P	Second , to compare demographic and clinical features of this comorbid diagnosis group compared to children with no diagnosis of either disorder , or those with either disorder in isolation.
P	Methods & procedures: Participants were drawn from a prospective , longitudinal community cohort study ( the Early Language in Victoria Study ) at 4 years of age ( n = 1607 ).
P	Demographic and clinical features for comparison were theoretically driven and included: gender , birth history , feeding status , speech and language status , family history of communication difficulties , maternal education , maternal vocabulary , maternal mental health and socioeconomic status.
P	Outcomes & results: Of the 160 children diagnosed with stuttering between 2 and 4 years of age , 6.88 % ( n = 11 ) also had a speech sound disorder.
P	Given the small sample size and number of comparisons performed , there was insufficient evidence to rule out that group differences observed were not simply due to chance.
P	Conclusions & implications: The prevalence of comorbid stuttering and speech sound disorder was lower in a community cohort compared to that reported in clinical studies.
P	Higher rates reported in clinical samples may be due to increased parental help-seeking behaviour when the two disorders co-occur.
P	Subsequently , these children may present to clinics more frequently.
P	Accurate representation of prevalence allows for population specific research on best practice assessment and intervention.
P	Currently little is known about how best to manage this caseload , therefore more research is required in this area , including the determination of prognostic variables to provide efficient and effective management.
P	The purpose of the study was to describe nurses' views of the issues to be addressed to improve care of the older adult in the emergency department ( ED ).
M	An exploratory content analysis examined the qualitative responses of 527 registered nurses from 49 U.S. hospitals who completed the Geriatric Institutional Profile.
R	5 central themes emerged from the analysis , representing a lack of older personhospital environment fit in the ED: ( a ) respect for the older adult and carers , ( b ) correct and best procedures and treatment , ( c ) time and staff to do things right , ( d ) transitions , and ( e ) a safe and enabling environment.
R	The nurses offered solutions to address lack of fit , including modifications to the social climate , policies and procedures , care systems and processes , and physical design.
C	The nurses' descriptions of the pressing issues surrounding care of older adults in the ED provide useful information to consider when developing a senior-friendly ED.
C	Results also illuminate solutions that can be taken to address issues.
C	These solutions give direction for future intervention research.
P	This article critically reviews work on the evolution of speech in the context of motor control.
P	It presents a brief introduction to the field of language evolution , of which the study of the evolution of speech is an integral component , and argues why taking the evolutionary perspective is useful.
P	It then proceeds to review different methods of studying evolutionary questions: comparative research , experimental and observational research , and computer and mathematical modeling.
C	On the basis of comparative analysis of related species ( specifically , other great apes ) and on the basis of theoretical results , this article argues that adaptations for speech must have evolved gradually and that it is likely that speech motor control is one of the key aspects that has undergone observable selection related to speech , because , in this area , all the necessary precursors are present in closely related species.
C	This implies that it must be possible to find empirical evidence for how speech evolved in the area of speech motor control.
C	However , such research is only in its infancy at the present moment.
B	Rural women in the United States experience disparity in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment when compared to their urban counterparts.
B	Given the 11% chance of lifetime occurrence of breast cancer for women overall , the continuum of breast cancer screening , diagnosis , treatment , and recovery are of legitimate concern to rural women and their primary care providers.
P	This analysis describes rural primary care providers' perceptions of the full spectrum of breast cancer screening , treatment , and follow-up care for women patients , and it describes the providers' desired role in the cancer care continuum.
M	Focus group interviews were conducted with primary care providers in 3 federally qualified community health centers serving a lower income , rural population.
M	Focus group participants ( N = 26 ) consisted of 11 physicians , 14 nurse practitioners , and 1 licensed clinical psychologist.
M	Data were generated from audiotaped interviews transcribed verbatim and investigator field notes.
M	Data were analyzed using constant comparison and findings were reviewed with a group of rural health professionals to judge the fit of findings with the emerging coding scheme.
R	Provider relationships were characterized as being with women with cancer and comprised an active behind-the-scenes role in supporting their patients through treatment decisions and processes.
R	Three themes emerged from the interview data: Knowing the Patient ; Walking Through Treatment With the Patient ; and Sending Them Off or Losing the Patient to the System.
C	These findings should be a part of professional education for rural practitioners , and mechanisms to support this role should be implemented in practice settings.
P	The purpose of this study was to develop and preliminarily evaluate the reliability and validity of the Symptom-Management Self-Efficacy Scale-Breast Cancer ( SMSES-BC ) related to chemotherapy.
M	The study included three stages.
M	This paper presents the results of stage 2 and stage 3.
M	In total , 34 items in the SMSES-BC were found during stage 1 from qualitative findings , a literature review , and expert suggestions ; the 34 items were used for the psychometric properties test.
M	Test-retest reliability and Cronbach a were assessed in the first sample , which included 45 participants for the pilot test ( stage 2 ).
M	The second sample , which included 152 patients , was used to assess the construct validity and concurrent validity ( stage 3 ).
R	The pilot test results revealed a test-retest reliability of.73 ( p <.001 ) and Cronbach a coefficient of.96 for the total scale.
R	Three factors ( managing chemotherapy-related symptoms , acquiring problem solving , and managing emotional and interpersonal disturbances ) were identified from exploratory factor analysis.
R	Correlation coefficient r was .40 ( p <.001 ) , which supported the association between SMSES-BC and the General Self-Efficacy Scale for concurrent validity.
C	The study results demonstrate acceptable reliability and validity for the SMSES-BC that was developed for measuring symptom-management self-efficacy related to chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer.
C	This study suggests further research to validate the construct of the SMSES-BC.

B	In recent years , operating theatre nurse students' education focused on ethics , basic values and protecting and promoting the patients' dignity in perioperative practice.
B	Health professionals are frequently confronted with ethical issues that can impact on patient's care during surgery.
P	The objective of this study was to present what operating theatre nursing students perceived and interpreted as undignified caring in perioperative practice.
M	The study has a descriptive design with a hermeneutic approach.
M	Data were collected using Flanagan's critical incident technique.
M	Operating theatre nurse students from Sweden and Norway participated and collected data in 2011 , after education in ethics and dignity.
M	Data consisting of 47 written stories and the text were analysed with hermeneutical text interpretation.
M	The study was approved by the Karlstad University's Research Ethics Committee.
R	The findings show careless behaviour and humiliating actions among health professionals.
R	Health professionals commit careless acts by rendering the patient invisible , ignoring the patient's worry and pain and treating the patient as an object.
R	They also humiliate the patient when speaking in negative terms about the patient's body , and certain health professionals blame the patients for the situation they are in.
R	Health professionals lack the willingness and courage to protect the patient's dignity in perioperative practice.
C	In the discussion , we have illuminated how professional ethics may be threatened by more pragmatic and utilitarian arguments contained in regulations and transplant act.
C	The findings reveal that patients were exposed to unnecessary suffering ; furthermore , the operating theatre nurse students suffered an inner ethical conflict due to the undignified caring situations they had witnessed.
B	To evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme.
M	General practitioners referred 198 employed patients on sick leave with symptoms of persistent work-related stress.
M	Using a waitlisted randomised controlled trial design , the participants were randomly divided into the following three groups: the intervention group ( IG , 69 participants ) ; treatment-as-usual control group ( TAUCG , 71 participants ) , which received 12 consultations with a psychologist , and the waitlisted control group ( WLCG , 58 participants ).
M	The stress treatment intervention consisted of nine 1-hour sessions conducted over 3 months.
M	The goals of the sessions were the following: ( 1 ) identifying relevant stressors ; ( 2 ) changing the participant's coping strategies ; ( 3 ) adjusting the participant's workload and tasks , and ( 4 ) improving workplace dialogue.
M	Each participant also attended a mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) course for 2 h a week over 8 weeks.
R	The IG and TAUCG showed significantly greater symptom level ( Symptom Check List 92 ) reductions compared to the WLCG.
R	Regarding the return to work ( RTW ) rate , 67% of participants in the IG returned to full-time work after treatment , which was a significantly higher rate than in the TAUCG ( 36% ) and WLCG ( 24% ).
R	Significantly more participants in the IG ( 97% ) increased their working hours during treatment compared with the participants in the control groups , TAUCG ( 71% ) and WLCG ( 64% ).
C	The stress treatment programme a combination of work place-focused psychotherapy and MBSR significantly reduced stress symptom levels and increased RTW rates compared with the WLCG and TAUCG.

B	The cognitive , emotional , and psychological consequences of dementia are profound and can include memory loss , processing and , communication difficulties , social isolation and agitation.
B	Procedural memory remains fairly intact in people with dementia ( PWD ) and is readily triggered via sensory cues and prompts.
B	As religious services are often highly structured , it is likely that PWD can participate competently , potentially enhancing their quality of life , and wellbeing.
P	This study aimed to investigate Christian worship leaders' attitudes and observations of PWD attending religious services , to identify recurring themes , and to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of participation in religious services on PWD.
M	The participants were Christian worship leaders experienced in conducting religious services for PWD.
M	The study adopted a grounded theory approach consisting of two phases: a focus group of four worship leaders at Phase 1 and a series of one-to-one interviews with eight worship leaders at Phase 2.
R	Five linked themes emerged: familiarity and structure ; enhanced sensory cues ; significance of worship leader's approach ; social support from and for family and carers ; and the personality and characteristics of the PWD.
R	These themes were used to develop a conceptual model , sharing the moderating and mediating factors of wellbeing.
C	Religious worship appeared to constitute a naturalistic psychosocial intervention comprised of the service itself and the social context.
C	Further investigation and conceptualisation of the interaction between PWD and their social environment is warranted , and collaboration with those people who constitute the PWD's social support network.
B	Literature regarding physical activity and fitness among subjects at risk for psychosis especially in adolescents is scarce.
B	This study evaluated the level of physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness among subjects at risk for psychosis in a relatively large birth cohort sample.
M	The study population consisted of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 including 6987 adolescents who self-reported their physical activity by responding to a postal inquiry in 2001-2002 at the age of 15-16 years.
M	Their cardiorespiratory fitness was measured in a clinical examination by a submaximal cycle ergometer test.
M	Vulnerability to psychosis was defined in three ways: having a parent with a history of psychosis , having prodromal symptoms of psychosis measured by PROD-screen questionnaire at the age of 15-16 years or having actually developed psychosis after the field study ( in 2002-2005 ).
M	The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used to find out about parental and the individual's own psychosis.
R	Those individuals who developed psychosis were more likely to be physically inactive ( OR 3.3 ; CI 95% ( 1.4-7.9 ) adjusted for gender , parental socio-economic status , family structure and parents' physical activity ) and to have poor cardiorespiratory fitness ( OR 2.2 ; 95% CI 0.6-7.8 adjusted for parental socio-economic status , family structure and parents' physical activity ) compared to those who did not develop psychosis.
C	Adolescents who would actually develop psychosis had a relatively low level of physical activity compared to their age mates.
C	General recommendations for physical activity would be important for subjects at risk for developing psychosis in order to avoid detrimental effect of physical inactivity on overall health.

B	We conducted a case study of the Zimbabwe National AIDS Trust Fund ( 'AIDS Levy' ) as an approach to domestic government financing of the response to HIV and AIDS.
M	Data came from three sources: a literature review , including a search for grey literature , review of government documents from the Zimbabwe National AIDS Council ( NAC ) , and key informant interviews with representatives of the Zimbabwean government , civil society and international organizations.
R	The literature search yielded 139 sources , and 20 key informants were interviewed.
R	Established by legislation in 1999 , the AIDS Levy entails a 3% income tax for individuals and 3% tax on profits of employers and trusts ( which excluded the mining industry until 2015 ).
R	It is managed by the parastatal NAC through a decentralized structure of AIDS Action Committees.
R	Revenues increased from inception to 2006 through 2008 , a period of economic instability and hyperinflation.
R	Following dollarization in 2009 , annual revenues continued to increase , reaching US$38.6 million in 2014.
R	By policy , at least 50% of funds are used for purchase of antiretroviral medications.
R	Other spending includes administration and capital costs , HIV prevention , and monitoring and evaluation.
R	Several financial controls and auditing systems are in place.
R	Key informants perceived the AIDS Levy as a 'homegrown' solution that provided country ownership and reduced dependence on donor funding , but called for further increased transparency , accountability , and reduced administrative costs , as well as recommended changes to increase revenue.
C	The Zimbabwe AIDS Levy has generated substantial resources , recently over US$35 million per year , and signals an important commitment by Zimbabweans , which may have helped attract other donor resources.
C	Many key informants considered the Zimbabwe AIDS Levy to be a best practice for other countries to follow.
B	Although midwife care is slowly but consistently increasing in the United States , not much is known regarding women who use a midwife.
B	Our objectives were to compare the sociodemographic and health history characteristics , and the quality of patient-provider communication , between women who used a midwife and those who used a physician for prenatal care and/or birth.
M	We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the nationally representative Listening to Mothers III survey.
M	We report descriptive findings using weighted proportions and means with standard deviations.
M	We used the two one-sided tests procedure to assess the equivalence of women who used midwives and those who used physicians.
R	Nearly 13% of women used a midwife for prenatal care or as a birth attendant.
R	Women who used a midwife for prenatal care were similar to women who used a physician in most sociodemographic and health history characteristics , as well as their patient-provider communication scores , with the exception of the percentage of White ( 61.7 +/- 5.0 [midwives] , 54.3 +/- 1.5 [physicians] ) and married women ( 68.7 +/- 4.9 [midwives] , 60.6 +/- 1.5 [physicians] ).
R	Women who used a midwife as a birth attendant were similar to women who used a physician as a birth attendant in most characteristics , with the exception of age over 35 years ( 7.5 +/- 1.6 [midwives] , 15.7 +/- 1.1 [physicians] ) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children support ( 56.8 +/- 4.9 [midwives] , 50.0 +/- 1.6 [physicians] ).
C	Women who use midwives are similar to those who use physicians and our findings do not confirm the common perception that midwife patients are a self-selected group of wealthier , more educated women.

B	Major deficiencies exist in undergraduate nursing education for Palliative Care.
B	Opportunities to care for dying patients are often unavailable to students in traditional clinical settings.
B	Palliative care simulation is an innovative strategy that may help to prepare undergraduate nursing students to provide quality palliative/end of life care.
B	It is valuable to explore the student nurses' beliefs , feelings and satisfaction regarding the impact that simulation clinic applied to palliative care has and how it influenced their overall experience of caring for a dying patient and the patient's family.
B	This study aimed to evaluate a learning intervention in palliative care using a low-fidelity clinical simulation for undergraduate nursing students from a Spanish university , based on the analytics of their expectations and learning objectives.
M	Sixty-eight students participated in this mixed descriptive design study , they participated in a palliative care simulation scenario and completed three questionnaires which assess the knowledge and expectations before the simulation and the subsequent satisfaction with the performance and learning received.
R	The intervention in question met students' learning expectations , singling out social abilities as important tools in palliative care training , and the students were satisfied with the presented case studies.
C	Our results suggest that low-fidelity clinical simulation intervention training in palliative care is an appropriate and low-cost tool for acquiring competitive skills.
C	Learning in the simulation scenarios provides a mechanism for students to improve student communication skills.

M	The threshold of P.V was considered 0.05.
R	Overall , 770 women with mean age 33.9 +/- 9.3 years were interviewed.
R	Majority of them were married ( 72.27% ) , housewives ( 62.2% ) , of Persian ethnicity ( 64.3% ) , and educated to high school level ( 43.8% ).
R	Age with dimensions of health except role emotional , mental health , and social functioning had significant association with B from -0.65 to -0.16.
R	educational level with dimensions of health except role emotional andsocial functioning had significant association with B from 3.61 to 6.43 ( P<0.05 ).
R	Income with dimensions of health except role physical had significant association with B from -9.97 to -4.42.
C	Reflection of unfavorable economic conditions and low education level on negative women health experiences are alarming.
C	Interaction between social determinants of health and health status must be considered in policymaking , and there is a need for policies that would enhance health of women in the low education and income brackets.
B	Social and lifestyle activities may serve as potential moderators of the association between negative life events ( NLEs ) and depressive symptoms among older adults.
B	In this study , we examined whether social and lifestyle activities moderate the association between NLEs and depressive symptoms among older adults , and which activities are significant moderators.
M	The data came from a community-based sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 65 years or older.
M	Of the 731 eligible older adults , 682 completed the Japanese version of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale.
M	We measured 15 specific negative life events as well as 17 social and lifestyle activities which were grouped into four categories.
R	Specific NLEs pertaining to human relationships , physical condition and financial status were all or were mostly associated with depressive symptoms.
R	Significant moderating roles of social and lifestyle activities on the association of NLEs with depressive symptoms were observed between "loss of a significant other" and "contact with family members and friends" ( beta = -0.282 , SE = 0.091 , p = 0.002 ) ; "change in human relationships" and "contact with family members and friends" ( beta = -0.270 , SE = 0.137 , p = 0.048 ) ; and "change in human relationships" and "community involvement" ( beta = -0.344 , SE = 0.133 , p = 0.010 ).
C	The most statistically significant variable moderating the associations between negative life events and depressive symptoms was "having frequent contact with family members".
C	Depressive symptoms arising from troublesome interpersonal relationships in one's proximal network might be moderated by positive interpersonal relationships.
B	A child's adult height is commonly predicted using their target height , based on mid-parent height.
B	However , if no growth disorder is suspected , the child's current height is a far better predictor of their adult height.
P	To develop a chart to predict a child's adult height from their current height , adjusting for regression to the mean.
M	Data from the First Zurich Longitudinal Growth Study provided correlations between child height and adult height by age and sex , for use in a regression model predicting adult height centile from child height centile.
M	The model was validated using data from the British 1946 and 1958 birth cohorts.
R	The chart is illustrated superimposed on the British 1990 boys height chart.
R	The predicted height has a standard error of 4-5 cm for ages from 4 years to puberty in both sexes.
R	The regression adjustment partially compensates for biased predictions in early and late developers in puberty.
R	A simplified version of the chart for restricted age ranges is also shown , as used on the UK-WHO 0-4 years growth charts.
C	The height prediction chart should be of value for parents , and indirectly professionals , to predict adult height in their children.
B	Advances in social technologies offer new tools for large scale data collection and analysis of peer influence and social networks on substance use attitudes and behaviors.
P	The objective of this study was to determine if text message content can predict alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and behaviors.
M	Text messages from 91 males ages 18-25 were monitored over a period of 6 months and examined for content related to alcohol and marijuana.
M	Self-report data indicating alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and behaviors were used to determine relationships between text message content , social network structure , and substance use attitudes and behaviors.
R	In total , 23 ,173 text messages were analyzed with 166 text messages including alcohol related terms and 195 text messages including drug related terms.
R	Individuals who sent text messages related to alcohol use were more likely to have problem alcohol use and positive attitudes toward alcohol use , and individuals who sent text messages related to marijuana use reported higher frequency of marijuana use and more positive attitudes toward marijuana use.
R	Individuals with multiple daily marijuana use were in positions that had less control over network structure.
C	The results of this study indicate that monitoring text message content and social network structure among emerging adult males can potentially predict alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and behaviors.
C	Text message content analysis is a novel technique increasing our understanding of the role of peer influence and social network on substance use attitudes and behaviors.
B	Children with delayed speech and language development are at considerable risk for later language impairment , social and behavioural problems , and illiteracy.
B	Early diagnosis is needed for intervention planning and prevention.
B	However , a speech and language test for Thai children has not been available.
P	To establish a Thai Speech and Language Test for Thai children between zero and 2 years of age.
M	The authors reviewed both Thai and international speech and language development tests and studies related to factors associated with speech and language development.
M	A Thai Speech and Language Test for children between zero and 2 years of age ( TSLT2 ) was then formulated.
M	The test was used with 419 typically developing Thai children in Khon Kaen , north-east Thailand.
R	Language quotients were calculated to quantify/qualify Thai language development norms.
R	Inter-rater reliability of the test ranged between 0.64 and 1 , while internal consistencies ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 for tests on children between 1 and 2 years of age.
C	Professionals or paraprofessionals can use the Thai Speech and Language Test for children between 1 and 2 years of age , which is the first Thai tool for the assessment , diagnosis and remediation planning of children with delayed speech and language development.
C	It should be also adapted for use in other regions in Thailand.
C	However , the test for children aged between 3 and 9 months should be revised and continue to be developed.
B	Crystal methamphetamine smoking is associated with many negative health consequences , including the potential for transmission of hepatitis.
B	We examined whether or not a kit for crystal methamphetamine smoking might have some potential to reduce the negative health effects of crystal methamphetamine smoking.
M	Five focus groups were conducted with crystal methamphetamine smokers recruited by community health agencies and youth shelters in Toronto , Canada.
M	Target groups included homeless/street-involved youth , sex workers , men who have sex with men , and youth in the party scene.
M	Participants ( n = 32 ) were asked questions about motivations for crystal methamphetamine use , the process of smoking , health problems experienced , sharing behaviour , risky sexual practices , and the ideal contents of a harm reduction kit.
R	Pipe sharing was widespread among participants and was deemed integral to the social experience of smoking crystal methamphetamine.
R	Heated pipes were unlikely to cause direct injuries , but participants mentioned having dry , cracked lips , which may be a vector for disease transmission.
R	Many reported having sex with multiple partners and being less likely to use condoms while on the drug.
R	Demand for harm reduction kits was mixed.
C	Changing pipe sharing behaviours may be difficult because many participants considered sharing to be integral to the social experience of smoking crystal methamphetamine.
C	Within the context of a broader health promotion and prevention program , pilot testing of safer smoking kits to initiate discussion and education on the risks associated with sharing pipes and unprotected sex for some communities ( e.g. , homeless/street-involved youth ) is worth pursuing.
B	Obesity is associated with depression.
B	This study aimed to evaluate whether clinical depression is reduced after bariatric surgery ( BS ).
M	Obese adults who received BS procedures from 2002 to 2014 were sampled from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
M	An interrupted time series design , with matched controls , was conducted from three years before , to a maximum of seven years after surgery.
M	Controls were matched for body mass index ( BMl ) , age , gender and year of procedure.
M	Clinical depression was defined as a medical diagnosis recorded in year , or an antidepressant prescribed in year to a participant ever diagnosed with depression.
M	Adjusted odds ratios ( AOR ) were estimated.
R	There were 3045 participants ( mean age 45.9 ; mean BMl 44.0 kg/m( 2 ) ) who received BS , including laparoscopic gastric banding in 1297 ( 43% ) , gastric bypass in 1265 ( 42% ) , sleeve gastrectomy in 477( 16% ) and six undefined.
R	Before surgery , 36% of BS participants , and 21% of controls , had clinical depression ; between-group AOR , 2.02 , 95%Cl 1.75-2.33 , P < 0001.
R	In the second post-operative year 32% had depression ; AOR , compared to time without surgery , 0.83 ( 0.76-0.90 , P < 0.001 ).
R	By the seventh year , the prevalence of depression increased to 37% ; AOR 0.99 ( 0.76-129 , P=0.959 ).
C	Despite matching there were differences in depression between BS and control patients , representing the highly selective nature of BS.
C	Depression is frequent among individuals selected to undergo bariatric surgery.
C	Bariatric surgery may be associated with a modest reduction in clinical depression over the initial post-operative years but this is not maintained.

B	The concept of 'health need' relates patient problems in symptom and psychosocial domains to available appropriate treatments.
B	We studied the effectiveness of inpatient treatment in modifying measured 'Health Needs' in children and adolescents admitted to UK inpatient units.
M	A prospective cohort study of 150 children and adolescents admitted to eight UK inpatient units , using formal pre-admission , pre-discharge and 1-year follow-up measurement of Health Needs.
R	Total patient 'Cardinal Problems' reduced highly significantly ( p < .001 ) from 8.5 at admission to 5.7 at discharge ( effect size .81 ) and to 4.1 one year after discharge ( effect size 1.35 ).
R	Functional domains free of 'Health Needs' increased from 14.9 to 19.4 ( effect size 1.08 ) from the point of admission to the end of follow-up.
R	These changes were clinically meaningful , present in all domains and reduced morbidity to a level typical of outpatient cases.
C	Admission ( mean length 116 days , SD 88 ) leads to clinically important improvement in measured Health Needs over multiple domains for children with serious , complex mental health difficulties.
C	These improvements in multiple symptom and functional domains persist over the next year.
B	The demand for hiring pediatric nurse practitioners ( PNPs ) is strong.
B	However , the number of newly educated PNPs has remained relatively flat during the past several years.
B	Understanding the rationale and timing for the decision to pursue this profession is essential to having a positive impact on increasing the future workforce.
M	A mail survey of all new PNPs certified between January 2009 and July 2011 ( N = 1040 ) was conducted.
R	The response rate was 79.9%.
R	Nearly half of all respondents ( 45% , N = 314 ) reported that they work in outpatient general pediatrics , 26% ( N = 184 ) in outpatient subspecialty pediatrics , and 22% ( N = 152 ) in inpatient settings.
R	More than one third ( 36% , N = 253 ) spend most of their time in a private practice.
R	Forty percent ( N = 307 ) reported that they decided to pursue education as an advanced practice nurse while in practice as a registered nurse ( RN ) , and 38% ( N = 289 ) made the decision before pursuing RN education.
C	Efforts to increase the PNP pipeline will need to be directed both to students during their RN education and to creating opportunities for current RNs to pursue advanced practice nurse education that is focused on children.
B	User reports suggest that long-term kratom ( Mitragyna speciosa Korth.
B	, Rubiaceae ) consumption can be associated with negative effects like constipation and withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue.
B	We aim to investigate constipation prevalence from kratom use and fatigue severity during kratom cessation in individuals who reported regular ingestion of kratom decoction.
M	A total of 125 male regular-kratom users participated in this retrospective study.
M	The Constipation Assessment Scale ( CAS ) was administered to assess effects during kratom use.
M	The Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) was used to assess fatigue during kratom withdrawal.
R	All respondents were males , the majority being Malays ( 97% , n = 121/125 ).
R	Mean ( SD ) age was 34 years ( 11.2 ) , and mean ( SD ) duration of kratom use was 8.5 years ( 5.5 ).
R	A total of 57% had > 6 years kratom use history ( n = 71/125 ) , while 59% ( n = 74/125 ) had used three or more glasses of kratom tea/juice daily.
R	More than four-fifth ( 94% , n = 118/125 ) never experienced constipation ; only 6% ( n = 7/125 ) experienced constipation.
R	As for fatigue , 86% ( n = 108/125 ) reported fatigue during kratom cessation.
R	Results from chi-square analysis showed that withdrawal from higher ( three or more glasses daily ) kratom intake was associated with severe fatigue during kratom cessation.
C	Regular and higher ( three or more glasses ) consumption of kratom decoction did not appear to cause significant constipation problems , but users were prone to severe fatigue during kratom cessation.
B	Reflective practice is considered an essential aspect of personal and professional development , and critical reflection is considered the cornerstone of being an accountable and autonomous practitioner.
B	Tertiary education should lay the foundations of lifelong learning by ensuring students develop into critically reflective and reflexive practitioners , who demonstrate self-awareness and an ability to reflect on personal values and beliefs and their impact on the wider healthcare system.
B	This level of reflective practice is essential to effect change at both an individual and societal level.
B	Reflection should therefore be embedded into education programs as a learning , teaching and assessment strategy.
P	The aim of this paper is to describe a structured Model of Holistic Reflection embedded within an Australian Bachelor of Midwifery Program.
P	The paper firstly outlines the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of the newly developed model.
P	Secondly describes the six integrated and inter-dependant phases of the model.
C	The aim of developing the Holistic Reflective Model was to produce a sound educational tool to assist midwifery students to progressively build reflexivity and reflective practice.
C	Furthermore , provide midwifery academics with an educational resource to facilitate development of reflective and critical thinking skills in students.
C	The specific intention was to promote deep personal and transformative learning across an entry to practice program.
C	This paper highlights a number of ways the model can be embedded within the curriculum to support the scaffolded development of critical reflection and reflexivity required to facilitate transformative learning.
C	While evaluation is required the model may have transferability to other disciplines.

B	Crime may be a significant barrier to physical activity for urban African American women , yet few studies have examined this relationship in intervention studies.
B	This study examines relationships among neighborhood crime incidents , perceptions of crime and safety , and adherence in a walking intervention among urban , midlife African-American women.
M	The sample includes 148 women living in the City of Chicago.
M	Violent crimes , disorder crimes , gun violence , and crime-related safety were examined.
M	Adherence to walking frequency was measured as the percentage of recommended walks completed.
R	Controlling for demographic characteristics and treatment group , multivariate regression analyses showed walking adherence was not associated with any of the crime measures or crime-related safety ( R( 2 ) = 0.130 to 0.147 ).
R	The effect of enhanced treatment did not differ by levels of objective or perceived neighborhood crime or safety.
R	Weak to moderate bivariate correlations were observed between objective crime measures and perceived disorder crime and crime-related safety ( r = 0.04 to 0.25 ).
C	Weak correlations between perceived and objective crime measures suggest they are measuring different aspects of the crime environment.
C	Future studies should examine perceived and objective measures in other populations and settings and other neighborhood social factors which may moderate crime and safety effects on outcomes of physical activity interventions.
B	The objective of this study was to develop a rating tool for policy makers to prioritize breast cancer interventions in low-and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) , based on a simple multi-criteria decision analysis ( MCDA ) approach.
B	The definition and identification of criteria play a key role in MCDA , and our rating tool could be used as part of a broader priority setting exercise in a local setting.
B	This tool may contribute to a more transparent priority-setting process and fairer decision-making in future breast cancer policy development.
M	First , an expert panel ( n = 5 ) discussed key considerations for tool development.
M	A literature review followed to inventory all relevant criteria and construct an initial set of criteria.
M	A Delphi study was then performed and questionnaires used to discuss a final list of criteria with clear definitions and potential scoring scales.
M	For this Delphi study , multiple breast cancer policy and priority-setting experts from different LMICs were selected and invited by the World Health Organization.
M	Fifteen international experts participated in all three Delphi rounds to assess and evaluate each criterion.
R	This study resulted in a preliminary rating tool for assessing breast cancer interventions in LMICs.
R	The tool consists of 10 carefully crafted criteria ( effectiveness , quality of the evidence , magnitude of individual health impact , acceptability , cost-effectiveness , technical complexity , affordability , safety , geographical coverage , and accessibility ) , with clear definitions and potential scoring scales.
C	This study describes the development of a rating tool to assess breast cancer interventions in LMICs.
C	Our tool can offer supporting knowledge for the use or development of rating tools as part of a broader ( MCDA based ) priority setting exercise in local settings.
C	Further steps for improving the tool are proposed and should lead to its useful adoption in LMICs.
B	Glutamate deregulation may be involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia , mainly through N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor dysfunction.
B	Memantine , a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease , acts as a weak nonselective NMDA receptor antagonist.
B	The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of memantine as an adjunctive treatment to clozapine in patients with refractory schizophrenia.
M	In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , outpatients with refractory schizophrenia according to DSM-IV clinical criteria were randomly assigned , from March 2005 to February 2008 , to receive either 20 mg/d memantine ( n = 10 ) or placebo ( n = 11 ) , in addition to clozapine , for 12 weeks.
M	The primary outcome measure was the total score on the 18-item Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale ( BPRS ) and BPRS subscales of positive and negative symptoms.
M	Secondary outcomes were global severity of disease as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) , cognition as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , and extrapyramidal symptoms as assessed by the Simpson-Angus Scale ( SAS ).
R	Twenty-one participants completed the study and were used in the analysis.
R	Significant improvement ( P<.01 ) on the total BPRS score , its subscales of positive ( effect size [ES] = - 1.38 ) and negative ( ES = -3.33 ) symptoms , the CGI score ( ES = 1.56 ) , and the MMSE score was observed with memantine as compared with placebo.
R	No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were observed.
C	Memantine add-on to clozapine therapy was associated with improvement in negative and positive symptoms in refractory schizophrenia patients.

B	Given fathers' potential role in bringing about desired child welfare case outcomes , researchers have begun to identify factors that impact agency efforts to identify and involve fathers.
B	Racial-ethnic inequality and bias are not among factors studied , despite longstanding evidence that racial-ethnic minority children make up a disproportionate share of the child welfare population.
P	We set out to identify racial-ethnic patterns in initial casework activity with non-resident fathers and explore whether select factors explain racial-ethnic differentials.
P	Participants and
M	Caseworkers of 1 ,754 children in foster care in four U.S. states were surveyed.
M	Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with whether agencies identified , located , and contacted nonresident fathers.
R	Agencies were less likely to identify nonresident fathers of Black , Latinx , and Multiracial children , relative to those of White children.
R	Among fathers whom agencies identified , Black and Latinx fathers were less likely to be located.
R	Among fathers whom agencies located , Black and Latinx fathers were less likely to be contacted.
R	Whereas greater rates of international mobility among Latinx fathers explained agencies' disproportionately low rates of contact , no other factor explained racial-ethnic differentials.
C	We find evidence of historical racial-ethnic disproportionalities across the three initial stages of casework practice with nonresident fathers in U.S. child welfare systems.
C	Though more recent data are needed , this research suggests that racial-ethnic minority foster children are more likely than White foster children to be denied the benefits of agency-father contact , whether due to societal or systemic racial inequalities.
B	Screening is intended to advance diagnosis thereby shifting the stage distribution towards more locally confined stages.
B	Consequently we aimed to estimate trends in stage-specific breast cancer in relation to the introduction of population-based screening.
M	From the Cancer Registry of Norway we retrieved cancer stage , age and year of diagnosis on all women aged 20 or older diagnosed with breast cancer during the period 1987-2010 in Norway ( approximate source population: 1.8 million ).
M	Three calendar-time periods were defined: before ( 1987-95 ) , during ( 1996-2004 ) , and after ( 2005-10 ) screening was introduced ; and two age groups: women eligible for screening ( 50-69 years ) or younger ( 20-49 years ).
M	Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence of localized ( stage I ) and more advanced cancer ( stages II+ ) , respectively , and logistic regression to estimate the proportion of localized cancer.
R	The annual incidence of localized breast cancer among women aged 50-69 years rose from 63.9 per 100 000 before the introduction of screening to 141.2 afterwards , corresponding to a ratio of 2.21 ( 95% confidence interval: 2.10 ; 2.32 ).
R	The incidence of more advanced cancers increased from 86.9 to 117.3 per 100 000 afterwards , corresponding to a 1.35 ( 1.29 ; 1.42 )-fold increase.
R	Advanced cancers also increased among younger women not eligible for screening , whereas their incidence of localized cancers remained nearly constant.
C	Incidence of localized breast cancer increased significantly among women aged 50-69 years old after introduction of screening , while the incidence of more advanced cancers was not reduced in the same period when compared to the younger unscreened age group.
P	This study examined the relationship between language and planning , a higher order executive function skill , in children with specific language impairment ( SLI ) and typically developing ( TD ) children.
P	We hypothesized differences between groups in planning performance and in the role of verbal mediation during planning.
M	Thirty-one children with SLI and 50 TD age-matched peers ( 8-12 years ) participated in the study.
M	We assessed language ability via a standardized language measure and planning via a dual-task Tower of London paradigm with 3 conditions: no secondary task ( baseline ) , articulatory suppression secondary task ( disrupted verbal mediation ) , and motor suppression secondary task ( control for secondary task demand ).
R	We found similar overall accuracy between children with SLI and TD peers on the Tower of London.
R	Children with SLI executed trials more slowly at baseline than TD peers but not under articulatory suppression , and children with SLI spent less time planning than TD children at baseline and under articulatory suppression.
R	There was a significant interaction among group , language ability , and planning time under articulatory suppression.
R	Children with SLI who had relatively better language ability spent less time planning than children with SLI who had poorer language ability when verbal mediation was disrupted.
R	This pattern was reversed for TD children.
C	This study provides evidence for a relationship between language and planning , yet this relationship differed between children with SLI compared to TD peers.
C	Findings suggest that children with SLI use nonlinguistic perceptual strategies to a greater degree than verbal strategies on visuospatial planning tasks and that intervention might address strategy use for planning.
P	Perceptual estimates of voice quality obtained using rating scales are subject to contextual biases that influence how individuals assign numbers to estimate the magnitude of vocal quality.
P	Because rating scales are commonly used in clinical settings , assessments of voice quality are also subject to the limitations of these scales.
P	Instead , a matching task can be used to obtain objective measures of voice quality , thereby facilitating model development and tools for clinical use.
M	Twenty-seven individuals participated in a rating task or at least 1 of 3 matching tests ( named after their modulation functions: SINE , SQUARE , POWER ) to quantify the degree of roughness in dysphonic voice stimuli.
M	Participants evaluated the roughness of 34 voice samples using an amplitude-modulated complex carrier.
R	The matching thresholds were highly correlated with the ratings estimates.
R	Reliability of thresholds did not significantly differ across tasks , but linear regressions showed that the POWER test resulted in larger perceptual distances.
C	A matching task can be used to obtain reliable estimates of roughness in dysphonic voices.
C	The POWER comparison is recommended because the variability in matching thresholds across the range of roughness was evenly distributed , and the perceptual distances between stimuli were maximized.
P	There is a need to gain deeper knowledge about women's experience of vaginal birth after caesarean section ( VBAC ).
P	Considerable research has been conducted on VBAC ; however , only a few qualitative studies focus on women's experiences.
P	Therefore , the aim of this study was to describe the lived experiences of VBAC among women resident in Sweden , a country with a high VBAC rate.
M	This studywas performed in accordance with a phenomenological reflective lifeworld approach.
M	Interviews were conducted with nine women in an urban region of Sweden one year after their VBAC birth.
R	The essential meaning of the studied phenomenon is "to challenge oneself as a childbearing woman" , which is further described by its four constituents: "striving for support from professionals" , "desiring the experience" , "contrasting and comparing memories of two different births" and "being part of the birthing culture".
C	The experience of VBAC meant regained trust in the ability to give birth vaginally.
C	The women lacked follow-up and support after the caesarean section ( CS ) , during the subsequent pregnancy and the forthcoming VBAC.
C	Enhanced support could be a key factor in helping women meeting the challenge and feel confident about giving birth vaginally despite their previous experiences of CS.
P	This study assessed the accuracy with which a rural population reported daily walking distances using a 7-day activity recall questionnaire obtained quarterly compared to pedometer readings.
M	Study participants were 48 Hutterite men and women aged 11-66 years.
R	Pedometer-miles quartiles were associated with self-reported daily miles ( P = .008 ) and self-reported previous-year average miles ( P = .03 ) quartiles.
R	Among males , the relationship between pedometer-miles and self-reported daily miles differed depending upon walking pace , with a stronger correlation at a faster pace ( interaction , P = .006 ).
R	Among females , pedometer-miles correlated with age and remained associated with self-reported daily and previous-year average miles when age was in the statistical model ( P = .006 and .008 ).
R	The difference between pedometer-miles and self-reported previous-year average miles tended to increase with age ( P = .06 ).
C	SDPAR may be a useful instrument in measuring miles walked/day among rural populations.
B	Access to sterile syringes to injecting drug users ( IDU ) reduces sharing behavior and prevents the transmission of HIV.
P	To describe the barriers to access to sterile syringes for IDUs in Lebanon from the perspectives of pharmacists and IDUs.
M	in this qualitative study conducted in Lebanon , data were collected from 72 syringe purchase tests at pharmacies , 64 interviewees with pharmacists and 2 focus groups with injecting drug users.
M	Two independent researchers analyzed the verbatim transcripts.
R	Results revealed that pharmacists often deny access to sterile syringes to IDUs who are frequently stigmatized and intimidated at pharmacies.
R	While no large gender differences in pharmacists' attitudes and practices were observed , inequalities in syringe access were noticed with men IDUs more often denied purchase.
R	Pharmacists had several barriers to sell syringes to IDUs including fear of disease spread , increased drug use , inappropriately discarded syringes , staff and customer safety , and business concerns.
R	IDUs had several challenges to purchase syringes including stigmatization , intimidation , physical harassment , concern to reveal identity , fear of arrest and syringe price abuse.
C	Identifying the barriers to and facilitators of access to sterile syringes to IDUs is important to guide the development of efficient policies.
C	Findings implicate the importance of empowering IDUs to purchase syringes at pharmacies through reducing the negative attitude towards IDUs and strengthening pharmacists' role in the promotion of health of IDUs.
C	Findings also suggest that the habit of syringe sharing would decrease if the legal and cultural barriers to access are reduced.
P	Impairments in the social use of language are universal in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , but few standardized measures evaluate communication skills above the level of individual words or sentences.
P	This study evaluated the Expression , Reception , and Recall of Narrative Instrument ( ERRNI ; Bishop , 2004 ) to determine its contribution to assessing language and communicative impairment beyond the sentence level in children with ASD.
M	A battery of assessments , including measures of cognition , language , pragmatics , severity of autism symptoms , and adaptive functioning , was administered to 74 8-to 9-year-old intellectually able children with ASD.
R	Average performance on the ERRNI was significantly poorer than on the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition ( CELF-4 ).
R	In addition , ERRNI scores reflecting the number and quality of relevant story components included in the participants' narratives were significantly positively related to scores on measures of nonverbal cognitive skill , language , and everyday adaptive communication , and significantly negatively correlated with the severity of affective autism symptoms.
C	Results suggest that the ERRNI reveals discourse impairments that may not be identified by measures that focus on individual words and sentences.
C	Overall , the ERRNI provides a useful measure of communicative skill beyond the sentence level in school-aged children with ASD.
P	The primary goal was to identify organizational conditions for developing a learning-oriented behavioral control system , an issue that has been neglected in previous studies.
M	The authors conducted a case study of Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim ( NBI ).
R	We found that a behavior-based sales management control system facilitates learning by salespersons when 1 ) the focus is on skill development , 2 ) fewer key performance indicators are being used , and 3 ) supportive supervision and knowledge sharing are promoted.
R	Research
C	Because this was a single case study , it is necessary to investigate other cases in other countries and to compare the results with those of NBI to develop theories about learning-oriented behavior control systems.
C	In the early stages of sales reform , sales managers and medical representatives should not use multiple process indicators for multiple evaluations ; rather , they should use a small number of process indicators ( e.g. , number of visits per day ) so that all individuals concerned about a problem can share information and promote improvement.
B	Ethnic differences in the timing of human tooth development are unclear.
P	To describe similarities and differences in the timing of tooth formation in two groups of Sudanese children and young adults.
M	The sample consisted of healthy individuals from Khartoum , Sudan , aged 2-23 years.
M	The Northern group was of Arab origin ( 848 males , 802 females ) and the Western group was of African origin ( 846 males , 402 females ).
M	Each mandibular left permanent tooth from first incisor to third molar was assessed from dental radiographs into one of 15 development stages.
M	Mean ages at entry for 306 tooth stages were calculated using probit regression in males/females in each group and compared using a t-test.
R	Mean ages were not significantly different in most tooth stage comparisons between ethnic groups for both males ( 61/75 ) and females ( 56/76 ) , despite a tendency of earlier mean ages in the Western group.
R	Mean ages for most tooth stage comparisons between males and females ( 137/155 ) were not significantly different within ethnic groups suggesting low sexual dimorphism.
C	The mean ages of most mandibular tooth formation stages were generally not significantly different between ethnic groups or between males and females in this study.
B	E-cigarette use has increased in the US , yet , in some regions rates of cigarette use remain high.
P	To describe the prevalence and features of lifetime and past-year e-cigarette use among a clinical sample of polysubstance users in Kentucky , and to determine significant associations of past-year e-cigarette use.
R	Of the final sample ( N = 497 ) , 83.5% reported having ever used e-cigarettes and 97.2% reported having ever used cigarettes.
R	These rates surpass those found among Kentucky's general population.
R	Compared to those who did not report e-cigarette use , e-cigarette users were more likely to be younger (  = 33.4 vs. 43.6 , p<.001 ) and White ( 88.2.1% vs. 62.5% , p = .001 ).
R	E-cigarette users showed higher rates for lifetime incarceration ( 91.1% vs. 72.8% , p = .001 ) and past-year arrest ( 75.0% vs. 47.5% , p = .001 ).
R	This group also presented with more severe substance use history and lower mean age for illicit drug use initiation (  = 13.8 vs. 16.4 , p = .001 ).
R	Approximately 65% of the sample reported past-year e-cigarette use and 96.6% reported past-year cigarette use.
R	Logistic regression indicated that being younger ( AOR = .973 , p = .030 ) , White ( AOR = 1.92 , .046 ) , having a past-year arrest ( AOR = 1.73 , p = .047 ) and having used cigarettes ( AOR = 8.93 , p = .001 ) or kratom ( AOR = 3.04 , p = .025 ) within the past year were significantly associated with past-year e-cigarette use.
C	E-cigarette use was related to more severe drug-using patterns.
C	Rates of dual tobacco use among this sample are high , particularly among younger individuals.
C	In ecological contexts where cigarette use remains normative , it is likely that dual use will persist for nicotine-dependent , polysubstance-using individuals.
B	Nicotine withdrawal produces increased craving for cigarettes and deficits in response inhibition , and these withdrawal symptoms are predictive of relapse.
B	Although it is well established that these symptoms emerge early during abstinence , there is mixed evidence regarding whether they occur simultaneously.
B	Given the importance of the early withdrawal period , this study examined craving and response inhibition at 24 h and 72 h abstinence.
M	Twenty-one non-treatment seeking adult smokers were evaluated at baseline , 24 h , and 72 h abstinence for craving ( Questionnaire on Smoking Urges - Brief ) and response inhibition ( Stop Signal Task , Stroop Task , Continuous Performance Task ).
M	Generalised linear regression models were used for primary outcomes , and Pearson correlations for examining the association between craving and response inhibition.
R	Factor 2 craving ( anticipated relief of negative affect ) increased from baseline to 24 h abstinent ( p = 0.004 ) , which subsided by 72 h ( p = 0.08 ).
R	Deficits in response inhibition measured by the Stop Signal Task were observed at 72 h ( p = 0.046 ) , but not 24 h ( p = 0.318 ).
R	No correlation was found between response inhibition and craving at any time point ( p values>0.19 ) , except between the Stroop Task and the factor 1 craving at baseline ( p = 0.025 ).
C	Factor 2 craving peaked at 24 h , whereas deficits in response inhibition did not emerge until 72 h , indicating that need to target craving and cognitive function during early abstinence may not occur simultaneously.
C	Further characterizing the time course of withdrawal symptoms may guide development of targeted treatments for smoking cessation.
B	Because early detection of lung cancer can substantially improve survival , there is increasing attention for lung cancer screening.
P	To estimate public preferences for lung cancer screening and to identify subgroups in preferences.
M	Seven important attributes were selected using the literature , interviews , and a panel session.
M	Preferences were elicited using a swing weighting questionnaire.
M	The resulting attribute weights indicate the relative importance of swings from the worst to the best level between attributes.
M	Hierarchical clustering was used to identify subgroups with different attribute weights.
R	One thousand thirty-four respondents from a representative Dutch panel aged between 40 and 80 years were included.
R	The identified attributes were location of screening ( weight = 0.18 +/- 0.16 ) , mode of screening ( weight = 0.17 +/- 0.14 ) , sensitivity ( weight = 0.16 +/- 0.13 ) and specificity ( weight = 0.13 +/- 0.12 ) of the screening modality , waiting time until results ( weight = 0.13 +/- 0.12 ) , radiation burden ( weight = 0.13 +/- 0.12 ) , and duration of screening procedure ( weight = 0.10 +/- 0.09 ).
R	Most respondents preferred breath analysis ( 45% ) to giving blood samples ( 31% ) or going through a scanner ( 24% ) as screening modality ; 59% preferred screening at the general practitioner's office instead of at the hospital.
R	There was a significant difference in education between the five identified preference subgroups ( P < 0.01 ).
C	There is considerable variation in how people value attributes of lung cancer screening.
C	Different screening policies and implementation strategies may be appropriate for particular preference subgroups.
C	Our results indicate that people prefer breath analysis and that they are more likely to attend screening modalities that can be used at a primary care facility.
B	Sexuality-related constructs , such as sexual arousal , sexual sensation seeking ( SSS ) and sexual satisfaction , have been related to sexual behaviours that place one at risk of adverse consequences , such as sexually transmissible infections , HIV and unintended pregnancy.
B	The biopsychosocial model posits an array of factors , ranging from social environmental factors to biological and psychological predispositions , that may be associated with these sexuality constructs in adolescents.
M	Female African Americans aged 14-20 years were recruited from reproductive health clinics for an HIV intervention.
M	Baseline survey and follow-up DNA data ( n = 304 ) were used to assess biological , psychological and social environmental associations with the sexuality constructs of arousal , SSS and sexual satisfaction.
R	Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a higher depressive symptom rating was associated with higher arousability , whereas short serotonin transporter gene allele( s ) status was associated with lower arousability.
R	Impulsivity and perceived peer norms supportive of unsafe sexual behaviours were associated with increased SSS , whereas short serotonin transporter gene allele( s ) status was associated with lower SSS.
R	Higher social support was associated with higher levels of sexual satisfaction , whereas short serotonin transporter gene allele( s ) status was associated with lower satisfaction.
R	The sexuality constructs were also significantly related to the number of sex partners , the frequency of vaginal sex and the number of unprotected vaginal sex acts in the past 6 months.
C	The findings emphasise the importance of understanding biopsychosocial factors , including the role of serotonin as an indicator of natural variations in sexual inclination and behaviours , that influence sexuality constructs , which , in turn , are associated with sexual behaviours , to allow further refinement of sexual health clinical services and programs and promote the development of healthy
P	To assess the impact of funding reform on the productivity of teaching hospitals.
M	Based on the Information System of Federal University Hospitals of Brazil , 2003 and 2006 efficiency and productivity were measured using frontier methods with a linear programming technique , data envelopment analysis , and input-oriented variable returns to scale model.
M	The Malmquist index was calculated to detect changes during the study period: "technical efficiency change ," or the relative variation of the efficiency of each unit ; and " technological change" after frontier shift.
R	There was 51% mean budget increase and improvement of technical efficiency of teaching hospitals ( previously 11 , 17 hospitals reached the empirical efficiency frontier ) but the same was not seen for the technology frontier.
R	Data envelopment analysis set benchmark scores for each inefficient unit ( before and after reform ) and there was a positive correlation between technical efficiency and teaching intensity and dedication.
C	The reform promoted management improvements but there is a need of further follow-up to assess the effectiveness of funding changes.
P	This systematic review aimed to determine the effects of augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC ) intervention on speech production in children with autism or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.
M	A systematic review methodology was utilized to limit bias in searching , selecting , coding , and synthesizing relevant treatment studies.
M	This involved a multifaceted search for studies written between 1975 and May 2007 using various bibliographic databases , dissertation databases , hand searches of selected journals and published compilations of AAC theses and dissertations , and ancestry searches.
M	To be included , studies had to meet stringent criteria.
M	A coding manual and form facilitated data extraction in terms of participant characteristics , treatment characteristics , design and measurement , and outcomes.
R	Nine single-subject experimental design ( 27 participants ) and 2 group studies ( 98 participants ) were included.
R	Results indicated that AAC interventions do not impede speech production.
R	In fact , most studies reported an increase in speech production.
R	However , in-depth analyses revealed.
R	that the gains were rather modest.
C	Although AAC interventions do not appear to impede speech production and may result in increased speech production , the modest gains observed require realistic expectations among clinicians and other stakeholders.
C	Future research should be more hypothesis driven and aim to identify predictive child characteristics , such as prior speech imitation and object exploration skills.
B	Avoidable hospital readmission is a focus of quality improvement efforts.
B	The effectiveness of individual elements of the standard discharge process in reducing rehospitalisation is unknown.
M	The authors conducted a case-control study of 1039 patients experiencing rehospitalisation within 30 days of discharge and 981 non-rehospitalised patients matched on admission diagnosis , discharge disposition , and severity of illness.
M	In separate models for each discharge process component , the authors measured the relationship between readmission and discharge summary completion , contents of discharge summary , completion of discharge instructions , contents of discharge instructions , presence of caregiver for discharge instruction , completion of medication reconciliation , and arrangement of ambulatory follow-up prior to discharge.
R	Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics , including severity of illness and discharge disposition , the study failed to find an association between readmission and most components of the discharge process.
R	There was no association between readmission and medication reconciliation , transmission of discharge summary to an outpatient physician , or documentation of any specific aspect of discharge instruction.
R	Associations were found between readmission and discharge with followup arranged ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 1.21 ; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.37 ) and increasing number of medicines ( adjusted OR 1.02 ; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04 ).
C	Documentation of discharge process components in the medical record may not reflect actual discharge process activities.
C	Alternatively , mandated discharge processes are ineffective in preventing readmission.
C	The observed absence of an association between discharge documentation and readmission indicates that discharge quality improvement initiatives should target metrics of discharge process quality beyond improving rates of documentation.
B	Numerous studies have examined the impacts of pay-for-performance programs , yet little is known about their long-term effects on health care expenses.
P	This study aimed to examine the long-term effects of a pay-for-performance program for diabetes care on health care utilization and expenses.
M	This study represents a nationwide population-based natural experiment with a 4-year follow-up period under a compulsory universal health insurance program in Taiwan.
M	The intervention groups consisted of 20 ,934 patients enrolled in the program in 2005 , and 9694 patients continuously participated in the program for 4 years.
M	Two comparison groups were selected by propensity score matching from patients seen by the same group of physicians.
M	Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate differences-in-differences models to examine the effects of the pay-for-performance program.
R	Patients enrolled in the pay-for-performance program underwent significantly more diabetes specific examinations and tests after enrollment ; the differences between the intervention and comparison groups declined gradually over time but remained significant.
R	Patients in the intervention groups had a significantly higher number of diabetes-related physician visits in only the first year after enrollment and had fewer diabetes-related hospitalizations in the follow-up period.
R	Concerning overall health care expenses , patients in the intervention groups spent more than the comparison group in the first year ; however , the continual enrollees spent significantly less than their counterparts in the subsequent years.
C	The program seemed to achieve its primary goal in improving health care and providing long-term cost benefits.
B	As the population ages , the relative and absolute number of age-associated diseases such as dementia will increase.
B	Evaluation of the suitability and intake of medication and pharmacological treatment is an important aspect of care for people with dementia , especially if they live at home.
B	Regular medication reviews and systematic cooperation between physicians and pharmacists are not common in routine care.
B	Medication management ( MM ) , based on such a comprehensive home medication review could help to reduce drug-related problems and costs.
B	The present article presents a medication management specifically for the application in the ambulatory setting and describes its implementation as part of a larger trial.
M	A home medication review ( HMR ) and MM is implemented as part of the DelpHi study , a population based prospective , cluster-randomized controlled intervention study to test the efficacy and efficiency of the implementation of a collaborative care model in primary care.
M	people with dementia ( PWD ) and their caregivers are recruited by the patient's general practitioner.
M	Inclusion criteria are a positive screening result for dementia , living at home and regular intake of drugs.
M	PWD are asked to specify their regular pharmacy which is asked to participate in the study , too.
M	a comprehensive HMR is conducted as computer-assisted personal interview by specifically qualified Dementia Care Manager ( DCM ) at the people's home.
M	It includes detailed information about drugs taken , their storage , administration , adherence and adverse events.
M	The MM is conducted in cooperation between DCM , pharmacist and general practitioner and consists of a pharmaceutical evaluation , pharmaceutical recommendations and their application.
M	Pharmacists are trained and provided with regularly updated information.
M	The MM is designed to give information and recommendations concerning antidementia drugs , occurrence of drug related problems , intake of anticholinergic drugs , potentially clinically relevant drug-drug-interactions , adverse drug events and medication adherence.
C	The DelpHi-approach for medication management employs comprehensive instruments and procedures in the primary care setting under routine care conditions , and this approach should be useful in improving pharmacotherapy as part of the comprehensive treatment and care for people with dementia.
B	The Kana Pick-out Test ( KPT ) , which was developed in Japan , is suitable for evaluating frontal lobe function and screening for mild dementia.
B	However , the neural substrates involved remain to be elucidated.
B	The aim of the present study was to identify the regional perfusion patterns in the brain associated with performance scores on the KPT in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) , using brain perfusion assessed by single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ).
M	Twenty AD patients with high scores on the KPT and 20 age-and sex-matched AD patients with low scores were selected from 227 consecutive Japanese patients of the Memory Clinic of Okayama University Hospital.
M	All 40 subjects underwent brain SPECT with 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer , and the SPECT images were analyzed by Statistical Parametric Mapping.
R	With the exception of KPT scores , no significant differences were found between high and low scoring groups with respect to Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination scores , Mini-mental State Examination scores , or the depression score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscale.
R	Compared to patients with high scores on the KPT , AD patients with low scores on the KPT showed significant hypoperfusion in the left subgenual cingulate gyrus ( SGC ) extending to the right SGC.
C	Our results suggest that functional activity of the SGC is closely related to scores on the KPT.
C	KPT might be a promising strategy to use in detecting early stages of AD with low SGC function.
B	Little is known about current societal attitudes toward women with significant mobility disability who are visibly pregnant.
P	To use qualitative descriptive analysis methods to examine perceptions of women with significant mobility disability about how strangers reacted to their visible pregnancies.
M	In late 2013 , we conducted 2-h telephone interviews with 22 women with significant mobility difficulties who had delivered babies within the prior 10 years.
M	The semi-structured , open-ended interview protocol addressed wide-ranging pregnancy-related topics , including statements from strangers.
M	Most participants were recruited through social networks , coming from 17 states nationwide.
M	We used NVivo to sort the texts for content analysis.
R	The women's mean ( standard deviation ) age was 34.8 ( 5.3 ) years ; most were white , well-educated , and higher income , although half had Medicaid during their pregnancies ; and 18 used wheeled mobility aids.
R	Eighteen women described memorable interactions with strangers relating to their pregnancies or newborn babies.
R	Strangers' statements fell into six categories: ( 1 ) curious ; ( 2 ) intrusively and persistently curious ; ( 3 ) hostile , including concerns that taxpayers would end up supporting the mother and child ; ( 4 ) questioning woman's competence as a potential parent ; ( 5 ) oblivious , not recognizing visible pregnancy or motherhood ; and ( 6 ) positive.
R	Many women reported strangers asking how their pregnancy had happened.
R	The women doubted that visibly pregnant women without disabilities evoke the same reactions from strangers.
C	Women with mobility disability who are visibly pregnant may perceive reactions from strangers that appear intrusive.
C	Planning ahead for handling such encounters could reduce the stresses of these interactions.

B	The study of the diaries of suicides presents an opportunity for greater insight into the psychodynamics of suicide than does the study of suicide notes.
P	The present study analyzed the last year of the published diary of the Italian writer , Cesare Pavese ( 1908-1950 ) , to identify changes in the content over the last year of his life.
M	The last year of the published diary was analyzed using the Linguistic Word Count program.
R	The proportion of words related to positive emotions and optimism increased over the last year of Pavese's life , and the entries became less complex and more self-oriented.
C	The results confirm the changes in mood documented in diaries and letters from suicides in previous research , and extend the research to published diaries of famous individuals and in transition.
B	In order to understand why rates of overweight and obesity are so high in the Ecuadorian province of Galapagos , this study analyzes changes in household food expenditures and perceptions and practices related to food consumption patterns.
B	Galapagos is understood as an unusual but not unique case because conditions there graphically illustrate trends observed in communities and countries worldwide.
B	A mixed methods approach was employed: a quantitative component was based on expenditures for foods classified according to the NOVA system , and a qualitative component utilized focus group discussions , key informant interviews , and structured observations.
R	Galapagos residents increased consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods and decreased consumption of unprocessed and minimally processed foods.
R	Perceived barriers to healthy diets include price , availability , and quality of fresh produce , as well as easy access to industrialized processed and ultra-processed foods.
C	Changes in consumption patterns represent both local conditions and global trends ; in that sense , the factors that affect Galapagos residents are not unique.
C	Hence , these findings help elucidate processes observed in communities around the world.
B	A 23-h unit was established in June 2005 to relieve pressure on surgical beds.
B	Patients were to be discharged by 090011 without review by a doctor.
B	However , discharge without review remained the exception rather than the rule.
P	The aim of the current trial was to asses the affect of a protocol driven , nurse-initiated discharge process on discharge time , patient satisfaction and adverse events.
M	Randomised controlled trial.
M	A large , major metropolitan hospital in Queensland , Australia.
M	Patients undergoing a surgical procedure and requiring an overnight stay in the 23-h unit were eligible for inclusion.
M	182 were randomised and 131 patients completed the study.
M	Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: protocol driven , nurse-initiated or usual care.
M	The primary end-point was the proportion of patients discharged by 0900 h. Patients completed a self-report questionnaire two weeks after hospital discharge , to evaluate their satisfaction.
R	Of the 131 patients completing the trial , only 82 ( 62.6% ) were discharged by 0900 h.
R	In the Protocol group 45( 78.9% ) patients were discharged on time compared with 37 ( 50.0% ) in the usual care group.
R	This difference was statistically significant ( OR 3.75 ; 95% CI-1.74-8.21 ; p = 0.001 ).
R	The average length of stay in the 23-h unit was 16.5 ( SD 6.8 )h.
R	This did not differ by group ( MD 0.29 ; 95% CI-2.13-2.71 ; p = 0.81 ).
R	The overall mean satisfaction score was 95.4 ( SD 8.8 ) and results were similar between groups ( Protocol group 96.2 versus usual care group 94.6 ; p = 0.40 ).
C	A protocol driven , nurse-initiated discharge process in an overnight post surgery unit results in a higher proportion of patients being discharged by 0900 h without compromising patient satisfaction.

B	The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have made unprecedented demands on the nation's citizen soldiers , the National Guard and Reserve.
B	A major concern involves the repeated deployment of these forces overseas.
P	Using data from the Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors among the Guard and Reserve Force , we examined the effects of deployment on 6 health outcomes.
M	The Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors among the Guard and Reserve Force is a sample ( n = 17 ,754 ) of all Reserve component personnel ( including full time and/or activated Guard and Reservists ) serving in all pay grades throughout the world.
M	We relied on inverse probability of treatment weights to adjust for observed confounders and used sensitivity analyses to examine the sensitivity of our findings to potential unobserved confounding.
R	Observed confounders explain much of the apparent effect of deployment.
R	For men , the adjusted relationships could very well reflect further confounding involving unobserved factors.
R	However , for women , effects of deployment on marijuana use , symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder , and suicidal ideation are robust to adjustments for multiple testing and possible unobserved confounding.
C	These effects are large in practical terms and troubling but suggest that media reports of the harm caused by deployment may be overstated.
C	Such exaggerations run the risk of stigmatizing those who serve.
B	Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college students in the U.S. and is preventable.
B	Approximately 1100 college students die by suicide each year.
B	This study examined the prevalence and predictors of one-time and persistent suicide ideation , plans , and attempts reported during college.
M	Data were gathered prospectively over four years.
M	Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1253 first-year college students at one large mid-Atlantic university.
M	Risk factors were measured in Year 1.
R	An estimated 12%( wt ) of individuals experienced suicide ideation at some point during college , and of those individuals , 25% had more than one episode of ideation ( persistent ideation ; 2.6%( wt ) of the overall sample ).
R	Ten individuals had a plan or attempt during college ( 0.9%( wt ) of the sample ).
R	Risk factors for persistent suicide ideation included low social support , childhood or adolescent exposure to domestic violence , maternal depression , and high self-reported depressive symptoms.
R	Persistent ideators differed from one-time ideators only by higher levels of depression ( p = .027 ).
R	Persistent ideators were no more likely than one-time ideators to have made a suicide plan or attempt during college ( 8% vs. 9% , respectively ).
C	Although the sample size is large , only a small percentage of participants had persistent ideation , suicide plans or attempts during college.
C	These results have implications for programs aimed at identifying college students at risk for suicide.
C	The accurate identification of college students at risk for suicide is an important step toward suicide prevention.

B	Patients with affective disorders exhibit changes in regional brain function and show abnormal social adaptation.
B	However , to our knowledge , no near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) study has examined the relationship between these two phenomena longitudinally.
B	This study examined the region specific functional abnormality associated with bipolar disorder ( BD ) and major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , and the association between particular longitudinal changes in regional activation and social adaptation.
M	We evaluated frontotemporal functioning during a verbal fluency Lest ( VFT ) for patients with BD ( N=18 ) , those with MDD ( N=10 ) , and healthy controls ( HCs ; N=14 ) using MRS. MRS measurements and the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale ( SASS ) were administered twice with an interval of approximately 6 months.
R	The BD and MDD groups showed lesser activation than the HCs in the bilateral ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of the temporal cortex ( VLPFC/aTC ).
R	Longitudinal changes in SASS scores were positively associated with the extent of change in left VLPFC/aTC activation in the BD group and with right VLPFC/aTC activation in the MDD group.
C	Our small sample size limited statistical power , and the effect of medication and multiple comparisons cannot be excluded , although these effects were considered in the interpretation of the present results.
C	Longitudinal increases of VLPFC/aTC activation were associated with improvement in social adaptation in patients with BD and those with MDD.
C	MRS measurement could be a useful tool for objective evaluation of changes in social adaptation in BD and MDD.

P	This study was to investigate the reference accuracy in major nursing journals in Korea.
M	The references in articles from eight nursing journals from 2006 were compared with PubMed for authors , year , title , journal , volume , and page accuracy.
M	Four hundred sixty-six references were reviewed.
M	Errors were classified as major or minor and categorized by bibliographic headings ( author , title , journal , year , volume and page ).
R	Of the 466 references , 223 ( 47.9% ) had citation errors.
R	The reference error rates ranged from 28.6% to 58.7%.
R	Most errors occurred in the author element ( 37.9% ) , followed by title ( 20.9% ) , journal ( 19.0% ) , page ( 13.9% ) , volume ( 5.9% ) , and year ( 2.4% ).
C	This study identified a considerable error rate in the references of nursing journals.
C	Inaccuracy of references is a reflection on scholarly work of authors and journals.
C	Authors and Editorial committees are responsible for the accuracy of references.
B	Copy Number Variants ( CNVs ) contribute to a large fraction of genetic diversity and some of them have been reported to offer an evolutionary advantage.
P	To identify CNVs in pigmentary loci that could contribute to human skin pigmentation diversity.
M	This study assessed the existence of CNVs in every exon of candidate genes: TYR , TYRP1 , DCT , MC1R and SLC24A5 , using the Multiplex Amplifiable Probe Hybridization technique ( MAPH ).
M	This study analysed a total of 99 DNA samples of unrelated individuals from different populations.
M	Validation and further analysis in a larger Spanish sample were performed by RT-qPCR.
R	Five CNVs were identified by MAPH: DCT exons 4 and 8 , TYR exon 1 and SLC24A5 exons 1 and 4.
R	Real-time quantitative PCR ( RT-qPCR ) confirmed the CNV in exon 1 of SLC24A5.
R	This study further analysed the 5 promoter region of SLC24A5 and found another CNV in this region.
R	However , no association was found between the CNV and the degree of pigmentation.
C	Although the functional role of these structural variants in pigmentation should be the subject of future work , the results emphasize the need to consider all classes of variation ( both SNPs and CNVs ) when exploring the genetics of skin pigmentation.
P	Of all Canadian and American men who live to age 75 years , about half can expect to live to age 85.
P	Our objective is to examine how clinical diagnoses made before age 75 relate to a man's survival to age 85 years.
M	Since 1948 , a cohort of 3 ,983 young men ( mean age of 31 years at entry ) has been followed with routine contact and medical examinations to prospectively document incident disease.
M	Over 62 years of follow-up , 2 ,414 of the cohort lived to celebrate their 75th birthday.
M	Of these survivors , 1 ,060 ( 44% ) died before their 85th birthday.
M	Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the effects of ischemic heart disease , cancer , cerebrovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , peripheral arterial disease , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on all-cause mortality between age 75 and 85 years.
R	Modeled as six binary risk factors at age 75 years , all were significantly ( p < .01 ) and independently related to 10-year mortality.
R	Multivariate risk ratios ranged from 1.36 to 1.46 except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a risk ratio of 1.85 ( 95% CI: 1.38 , 2.49 ).
R	The cumulative 10-year probability of survival from age 75 to 85 among men with none of these diagnoses was 63% , 52% for any one diagnosis , 39% for two diagnoses , and 22% for three or more diagnoses.
C	Joint independence of these six common clinical diagnoses implies that each is important and their effects on mortality are cumulative.
P	To cross-culturally translate the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability ( IdFAI ) questionnaire into Persian and to assess its psychometric properties and factor structure.
M	The Persian version of IdFAI questionnaire was prepared after a forward-backward translation and cultural adaptation process.
M	One hundred and twenty patients with a history of lateral ankle sprain completed the Persian version of this questionnaire and the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool ( CAIT ) , Foot and Ankle Ability Measure , Foot and Ankle Outcome Score , Fear Avoidance Belief questionnaire and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia in the first test session.
M	Afterwards , 60 randomly selected patients completed the questionnaires in the second session.
M	Psychometric testing which included test-retest reliability , internal consistency , standard error of measurement ( SEM ) and minimal metric detectable change ( MMDC ) , weighted kappa coefficient and construct validity were performed using Spearman's correlation coefficient and confirmatory factor analysis of the three-factor structure of the IdFAI.
R	The interclass correlation coefficient , Cronbach's alpha , SEM and MMDC were 0.91 , 0.95 , 2.43 , and 6.73 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.86-0.95 ) for the IdFAI , respectively.
R	The repeatability of all the questions after one week was rated good to excellent ( kappa = 0.60-0.93 , p < 0.001 ).
R	The IdFAI total score had strong correlation with CAIT measure , but had moderate correlation with other questionnaires.
R	The results of factor analysis showed an adequate fit of the model to the data and goodness-of-various fit indices.
C	The Persian version of IdFAI is a reliable and valid tool to identify patients with functional ankle instability which have a history of ankle sprain.
C	Its original three-factor structure was replicated in this study.
B	Buprenorphine is the most frequently prescribed medication for treating substance use disorders in the United States , but few studies have evaluated the structure of treatment delivered in real-world settings.
B	The purpose of this study is to investigate adherence to current buprenorphine treatment guidelines using administrative data for Massachusetts Medicaid.
M	We identified buprenorphine treatment episodes beginning in 2009 through pharmacy claims.
M	We then used service claims to identify treatment-related physician , behavioral , and laboratory services received in the induction , stabilization , and maintenance phases of these treatment episodes.
M	Rates of service utilization were compared with those recommended in treatment guidelines.
R	A total of 3674 treatment episodes met inclusion criteria , representing 3005 unique Medicaid beneficiaries.
R	Liver enzymes were tested in 47.3% of episodes , but testing for hepatitis C ( 23.2% ) , hepatitis B ( 19.6% ) , and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ; 13.7% ) was less frequent.
R	Adherence to recommended physician visit frequency was 37.6% during induction , 39.7% during stabilization , and 51.2% during maintenance.
R	For behavioral care , adherence rates were 40.0% during induction , 41.2% during stabilization , and 41.0% during maintenance.
R	Rates of toxicology testing met or exceeded recommendations in just over 60% of episodes in the induction ( 61.1% ) , stabilization ( 62.1% ) , and maintenance ( 61.4% ) phases.
R	Although rates varied by treatment phase , substantial proportions of episodes showed no evidence of physician visits ( 27.2-42.8% ) , behavioral care ( 44.3-60.0% ) , and toxicology screening ( 25.3-39.0% ).
C	Our data suggest that there is significant variability in the structure of buprenorphine treatment provided to Massachusetts Medicaid beneficiaries , and that half or less of episodes include physician and behavioral visits at recommended frequencies.
C	The use of administrative data for this type of analysis is limited by the potential for missing or inaccurate data.
C	More research is needed to establish the levels of services most closely associated with positive outcomes to help guide providers in offering the highest-quality care.
B	Large-scale genetic data sets are frequently shared with other research groups and even released on the Internet to allow for secondary analysis.
B	Study participants are usually not informed about such data sharing because data sets are assumed to be anonymous after stripping off personal identifiers.
C	The assumption of anonymity of genetic data sets , however , is tenuous because genetic data are intrinsically self-identifying.
C	Two types of re-identification are possible: the "Netflix" type and the "profiling" type.
C	The "Netflix" type needs another small genetic data set , usually with less than 100 SNPs but including a personal identifier.
C	This second data set might originate from another clinical examination , a study of leftover samples or forensic testing.
C	When merged to the primary , unidentified set it will re-identify all samples of that individual.
C	Even with no second data set at hand , a "profiling" strategy can be developed to extract as much information as possible from a sample collection.
C	Starting with the identification of ethnic subgroups along with predictions of body characteristics and diseases , the asthma kids case as a real-life example is used to illustrate that approach.
C	Depending on the degree of supplemental information , there is a good chance that at least a few individuals can be identified from an anonymized data set.
C	Any re-identification , however , may potentially harm study participants because it will release individual genetic disease risks to the public.
B	Telephone helplines are considered to play an important role in preventing suicide and self-harm among callers in distress.
B	However , inconsistency in the methods of evaluating such services has limited the firm conclusions that can be drawn.
P	To evaluate the efficacy of a UK-based helpline from a service user and helpline worker perspective.
M	Callers were asked about their mental state at the beginning and end of the call with a short questionnaire.
M	Helpline workers were surveyed about their experiences of using the questionnaire as part of routine service provision.
R	The helpline was successful at reducing suicidal and self-harming ideation.
R	The short questionnaire method was also successfully integrated into routine practice.
C	Evaluating the efficacy of helplines can be successfully achieved using the short questionnaire method.
B	Omega 3 and vitamin E are two critical nutrients which include beneficial effects in coronary artery disease ( CAD ).
B	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of omega 3 alone supplementation or in combination with vitamin E on serum glucose and lipid levels and insulin resistance in CAD patients.
M	Participants of this clinical trial included 60 male patients with CAD who selected from Tehran Heart Center in Tehran , Iran in 2014.
M	They received 4 g/day omega 3 plus 400 IU/day vitamin E ( OE ) , 4 g/day omega 3 with vitamin E placebo ( OP ) , or omega 3 and vitamin E placebo ( PP ) for two months.
M	Serum glucose , lipids and insulin were assessed and HOMA-IR was calculated before and after the trial and effects of these nutrients on the highlighted parameters were compared within the study groups.
R	Serum glucose level increased significantly in OP group ( P=0.004 ) , but not in OE group.
R	OE and OP groups showed a significant decrease in fasting serum TG ( P=0.020 and P=0.001 , respectively ).
R	Serum insulin and HOMA-IR decreased significantly in OE group ( P=0.044 and P=0.039 , respectively ) but did not change significantly in OP group.
C	Although , omega 3 supplementation may include adverse effects on serum glucose level , co-administration of omega 3 and vitamin E can beneficially decrease serum insulin and insulin resistance in CAD patients.
B	Non-adherence to medication is a common and serious problem in health care.
B	To develop more effective interventions to improve adherence , there is a need for a better understanding of the individual types of non-adherence.
P	To determine clusters of non-adherence in neurological patients using a complex adherence questionnaire.
M	In this observational , monocentric study 500 neurological patients ( consecutive sampling ) were recruited in the Department of Neurology at the Jena University Hospital , Germany ( outpatient clinic , wards ) over a period of 5 months.
M	Patients with severe dementia or delirium who were unable to complete the questionnaire were excluded.
M	Due to missing adherence data , in total , 429 patients with common neurological disorders were analyzed.
M	Different types and clusters of non-adherence using the German Stendal Adherence to Medication Score ( SAMS ) were determined.
R	For the 429 patients , the mean age was 63 years ( SD = 16 ) , 189 were female.
R	According to the SAMS total score 74 ( 17.2% ) were fully adherent , 252 ( 58.7% ) showed moderate non-adherence and 103 ( 24% ) showed clinically significant non-adherence.
R	Principal component analysis with Varimax rotation revealed three independent factors explaining 60.5% of the SAMS variance.
R	The bulk of non-adherence was attributed to modifications of medication ( 41.7% ) and forgetting to take the medication ( 33.2% ) followed by lack of knowledge 25.1% about reasons , dosages and time of administration for the medication.
C	Intentional non-adherence was the primary self-reported behavior identified among non-adherent neurological participants.
C	Many patients modified their prescribed medication due to various reasons , such as side effects or lacking effect.
C	Different clusters require different interventions.
C	While for the cluster 'forgetfulness' the reduction of poly-medication and a behavioral approach with reminders seems reasonable , patients in cluster 'missing knowledge' and cluster 'modifications' may need an educational approach.
B	We have recently demonstrated that an obese-years construct is a better predictor of the risk of diabetes than the severity of body weight alone.
B	However , these risk estimates were derived from a population cohort study initiated in 1948 that might not apply to the current population.
P	To validate an obese-years construct in estimating the risk of type-2 diabetes in a more contemporary cohort study.
M	A total of 5 ,132 participants of the Framingham Offspring Study , initiated in 1972 , were followed up for 45 years.
M	Body mass index ( BMI ) above 29 kg/m( 2 ) was multiplied by the number of years lived with obesity at that BMI to define the number of obese-years.
M	Time- dependent Cox regression was used to explore the association.
R	The risk of type-2 diabetes increased significantly with increase in obese-years.
R	Adjusted hazard ratios increased by 6% ( 95% CI: 5-7% ) per additional 10 points of obese-years.
R	This ratio was observed to be similar in both men and women , but was 4% higher in current smokers than in never/ex-smokers.
R	The Akaike Information Criterion confirmed that the Cox regression model with the obese-years construct was a stronger predictor of the risk of diabetes than a model including either BMI or the duration of obesity alone.
C	In a contemporary cohort population , it was confirmed that the obese-years construct is strongly associated with an increased risk of type-2 diabetes.
C	This suggests that both severity and the duration of obesity should be considered in future estimations of the burden of disease associated with obesity.
B	Acculturative stress is known to contribute to chronic diseases among many immigrants and yet this association in Korean Americans remains unclear.
P	The study purpose was to examine the level of acculturative stress in Korean Americans and to determine if correlations existed with personal and physiological factors.
M	An exploratory , cross-sectional , descriptive study was conducted in a sample of 107 Korean American adults.
M	Data on acculturative stress and personal factors were collected using a survey questionnaire in addition to a direct measure of physiological factors ( i.e. , body mass index and blood pressure ).
R	All 107 participants were first-generation Koreans.
R	Most participants were women ( 66.4% ) , with a mean age of 53.9 +/- 10.7 , married ( 88.8% ) , and with a college education ( 84.2% ).
R	Acculturative stress was associated with a number of personal factors ( i.e. , arrival age , years of U.S education , years of U.S. residency , English proficiency ) , and the personal factors of gender , age , employment status , and years of U.S. residency were associated with the physiological factors.
R	No statistically significant associations were found between acculturative stress and physiological factors.
C	The mean acculturative stress score in this study was higher than findings from prior studies of Korean immigrants in the United States or Canada , with the rates of obesity and hypertension higher than prior reports of Korean Americans or Koreans residing in Korea.
C	Future study is necessary with a larger sample from a variety of different geographic areas of the United States to examine further the impact of acculturative stress on physiological factors during the process of acculturation.
B	International prevalence rates for intellectual disability vary widely with estimates often based on samples.
B	In Ireland people with an intellectual disability are identified in the national census.
B	Moreover , a national register of people receiving or requiring intellectual disability services is maintained and updated annually.
P	The prevalence rates from the census were contrasted with those from the register along with variations in prevalence across the 26 counties of Ireland.
M	2011 and 2016 Census of Population prevalence per 1000 for children ( aged 5-19 years ) and adults ( 20 years and over ) stratified by the 26 countries were contrasted with similar prevalence in the national register.
M	Publically available data from the 2011 census in Northern Ireland and Scotland were obtained.
R	The Irish census identified nearly twice as many children and adults than were on the national register.
R	Prevalence rates also varied across the 26 counties ; more so on the register than the census.
R	The Irish census had lower prevalence rates than Northern Ireland but higher than Scotland.
C	Determining the prevalence of intellectual disability is challenging due to variations in terminology.
C	A national register has advantages over reliance on census data for service planning.
P	Sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) are a significant source of calories and added sugars for youth ages 14-18 years in the United States.
P	This study examined the relationship between district-level policies and practices and students' consumption of regular soda , one type of SSB , in 12 large urban school districts.
M	Data from the 2012 School Health Policies and Practices Study and 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System were linked by district.
M	The outcome variable was soda consumption and exposure variables were district policies.
M	We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to calculate adjusted odds ratios ( AORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) after controlling for student characteristics and district free/reduced-price meal eligibility.
R	About 18% of students reported consuming regular soda at least once per day.
R	Most districts required high schools to have nutrition education , maintain closed campuses , and required/ recommended that schools restrict promotional products and sale of beverages.
R	Fewer districts required/recommended that schools offer healthful alternative beverages.
R	Students in districts that restricted promotional products had lower odds of regular soda consumption ( AOR =.84 , 95% CI = .71-1.00 ) , as did students in districts that restricted access to SSBs and offered healthful beverages when other beverages were available ( AOR = .72 , 95% CI = .54-.93 , AOR = .76 , 95% CI = .63-.91 ).
C	This study demonstrates that certain district-level policies are associated with student consumption of regular soda.
C	These findings add to a growing consensus that policies and practices that influence the availability of healthier foods and beverages are needed across multiple settings.

B	Many patients suffering from psychiatric disorders seek nonprofessional care before attending specialized services.
P	To study the help-seeking behaviour of patients referred to the psychiatric department of Al-Ain Hospital , which is the main university teaching hospital in UAE.
M	This study was a descriptive cross-sectional epidemiological survey.
M	All new patients attending the psychiatry out-patient clinic at Al-Ain Hospital were screened for nine consecutive months from March to November 2003 inclusive.
R	The sample consisted of 106 patients (  52 male ; 54 female ).
R	Prior to presenting to the psychiatric service , 44.8% consulted faith healers , 31% of whom had had a previous experience with them ; 45% reported some improvement but their symptoms recurred later , while 47% reported no improvement.
R	In 8% their symptoms worsened for the current episode.
R	Treatments received were herbal ( 29.8% ) and prayer ( 70.2% ).
R	Of the sample , 43.4% consulted a primary care physician before presenting to the secondary psychiatric care.
C	In this sample a sizable number of patients sought alternative methods of treatment before attending the specialized psychiatric services.
B	Confirmatory factor analytic studies have shown that posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Disorders ( DSM-5 ) may be better explained by two 6-factor models ( the Externalizing Behaviours model and the Anhedonia model ) and a 7-factor Hybrid model.
B	The latter model comprises the symptom clusters of intrusion , avoidance , negative affect , anhedonia , externalizing behaviours , and anxious and dysphoric arousal.
B	This model has received empirical support mainly in American samples.
B	Of note , there have been a limited number of studies conducted on samples from other countries.
P	This study aimed to examine the underlying dimensionality of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in a Spanish clinical sample exposed to a range of traumatic events.
M	Participants included 165 adults ( 78.8% females ) seeking treatment in trauma services in the Madrid area ( Spain ).
M	PTSD was assessed using the Global Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Scale 5 , a Spanish self-report instrument assessing posttraumatic symptoms according to the DSM-5 criteria.
M	Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in Mplus.
R	Both the 7-factor Hybrid model and the 6-factor Anhedonia model demonstrated good and equivalent fit to the data.
C	The findings of this study replicate and extend previous research by providing support for both the 7-factor Hybrid model and the 6-factor Anhedonia model in a clinical sample of Spanish trauma survivors.
C	Given equivalent fit for these two models and the fewer number of latent factors in the Anhedonia model , it was selected as optimal in a traumatized Spanish sample.
C	Implications and future research directions are discussed.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs ) exposure in 34 states and the District of Columbia , and whether exposure differs between rural and urban residents.
M	This cross-sectional study used data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health ( NSCH ) , restricted to states in which rural versus urban residence was indicated in the public use data ( n = 25 ,977 respondents ).
M	Bivariate analyses were used to estimate unadjusted associations.
M	Multivariable regression models were run to examine the association between residence ( rural or urban ) and ACE counts of 4 or more.
R	Compared to urban children , rural children had higher rates of exposure to the majority of the ACEs examined: parental separation/divorce , parental death , household incarceration , household violence , household mental illness , household substance abuse , and economic hardship.
R	In adjusted analysis , there was no significant difference for rural children compared to urban children.
R	The odds of 4 or more ACEs decrease as poverty levels decline , with children residing 0%-99% below the federal poverty line more likely to have reported 4 or more ACEs , compared to children residing 400% or above the federal poverty line ( aOR 4.02 ; CI: 2.65-6.11 ).
C	Our findings suggest that poverty is a key policy lever that may mitigate the burden of ACE exposure.
C	The findings of this study may be instructive for policymakers and program planners as they develop interventions to stop , reduce , or mitigate ACE exposure and the long-term impact of ACEs among children in rural America.
B	There has been a great deal of clinical concern regarding alprazolam abuse.
B	This paper reported on alprazolam positive cases of sudden or unnatural deaths presenting to the New South Wales Department of Forensic Medicine ( DOFM ) , 1/1/1997-31/12/2012.
M	Case series.
R	412 cases were identified.
R	There was a large increase in the annual number of cases , from 3 in 1997 to 86 in 2012.
R	By 2012 , 4.5% of all DOFM case presentations involved alprazolam.
R	The mean age was 41.3 years and 66.5% were male.
R	Circumstances of death were: accidental drug toxicity ( 57.0% ) , deliberate drug toxicity ( 10.4% ) , suicide by means other than drug overdose ( 12.6% ) , disease ( 10.0% ) , accident ( 5.1% ) , homicide ( 2.4% ).
R	The major factor driving the increase in cases was accidental drug toxicity involving alprazolam , rising from 0 in 1997 to 58 in 2012.
R	A history of drug/alcohol problems was noted in 80.4% , and 56.6% were injecting drug users.
R	The median alprazolam concentration was 0.08 mg/L ( range 0.005-2.10 mg/L ) , with 37.4% of cases having concentrations of >= 0.1 mg/L.
R	In 94.9% of cases , drugs other than alprazolam and its metabolites were present , including all accidental overdoses.
R	The most commonly detected drugs were opioids ( 64.6% ) , others were benzodiazepines ( 44.4% ) and alcohol ( 34.5% ).
R	A third ( 31.8% ) of cases were HCV positive.
C	Cases involving alprazolam increased markedly , driven mostly by toxicity deaths amongst people with known drug and alcohol problems.
C	Caution in prescribing alprazolam would appear appropriate , particularly to those with known drug dependence.

B	It is necessary to identify unidentified or less-concentrated issues in women's health dimension through an extended study.
B	This study is done to identify different dimensions of women's health among qualitative research.
M	The present meta-synthesis study is done through a systematic review.
M	The main criteria were to use qualitative studies issued in the same language and researches in which their participants were women.
M	All the published and indexed articles related to women's health in Iran at SID , Magiran and Iranmedex databases from 2001 to 2013 were scrutinized.
M	Search in these databases was done using key words "health" and "women".
M	Finally , 29 qualitative articles were chosen.
M	Data analysis was performed using qualitative content analysis.
R	Generally , concepts extracted from women's health dimension are classified in three main categories including personal , familial and social dimensions.
R	Each category includes some subcategories , too.
R	Personal factors consist of physical , psychological -emotional and spiritual ; familial factors consist of fertility , husband's support and women's fundamental roles , and social factors consist of cultural , socioeconomically support , and women's management issues.
C	In this meta-synthesis study , there was an effort to present a new interpretation of the previous studies.
C	This study helped attain a more comprehensive and deeper knowledge about women's health concept and reveal its different aspects , which are not assessed in the country.
B	A walking cadence of >= 100 steps/min corresponds to minimally moderate intensity , absolutely defined as >= 3 metabolic equivalents ( METs ).
B	This threshold has primarily been calibrated during treadmill walking.
B	There is a need to determine the classification accuracy of this cadence threshold to predict intensity during overground walking.
M	In this laboratory-based cross-sectional investigation , participants ( N = 75 , 49.3% women , age 21-40 y ) performed a single 5-minute overground ( hallway ) walking trial at a self-selected preferred pace.
M	Steps accumulated during each trial were hand tallied and converted to cadence ( steps/min ).
M	Oxygen uptake was measured using indirect calorimetry and converted to METs.
M	The classification accuracy ( sensitivity , specificity , overall accuracy , and positive predictive value ) of >= 100 steps/min to predict >= 3METs was calculated.
R	A cadence threshold of =100 steps/min yielded an overall accuracy ( combined sensitivity and specificity ) of 73.3% for predicting minimally moderate intensity.
R	Moreover , for individuals walking at a cadence >= 100 steps/min , the probability ( positive predictive value ) of achieving minimally moderate intensity was 80.3%.
C	Although primarily developed using treadmill-based protocols , a cadence threshold of >= 100 steps/min for young adults appears to be a valid heuristic value ( evidence-based , rounded , practical ) associated with minimally moderate intensity during overground walking performed at a self-selected preferred pace.
B	We sought to investigate and compare the clinical presentation , ultrasound findings , surgical characteristics , and causes of adnexal torsion among three groups: pediatric and adolescent population , reproductive-age women , and pregnant women.
M	Two hundred twenty-seven surgically confirmed episodes of adnexal torsion in 199 patients treated in our department from January 2008 to December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed.
R	Abdominal pain duration of >24 hours before emergency room presentation was more common in pediatric and adolescent patients compared with reproductive-age and pregnant women ( 42.3% vs. 28.4% and 15.5% , respectively , p=0.04 ).
R	However , there was no difference between the groups in the time interval from their emergency room admission to surgery.
R	Torsion of normal adnexa occurred in 11/44 ( 25.0% ) of pediatric and adolescent patients , 30/99 ( 30.3% ) of reproductive-age patients , and 12/56 ( 21.4% ) of pregnant patients , while torsion involving multicystic ovaries occurred in 0% , 4% , and 32.1% , respectively , torsion involving paraovarian cysts occurred in 20.5% , 14.1% , and 1.8% , respectively , and torsion involving benign dermoid cysts occurred in 4.5% , 15.2% , and 5.4% , respectively ( p<0.001 ).
R	Torsion involving supposedly functional ovarian cysts occurred in 45.5% , 34.3% , and 69.6% , respectively ( p<0.001 ).
R	The torsion recurrence rates were 18.2% in the pediatric subjects , 19.2% in reproductive-age women , and 10.7% in pregnant women ( p=0.3 ).
C	The presentation of adnexal torsion is similar in pediatric and reproductive-age and pregnant women , although the underlying adnexal pathology may be different.
C	Functional ovarian cysts cause the majority of torsion cases in pregnant women.
C	Recurrence of torsion may occur in any age group.
B	Raloxifene use in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events ( VTE ) 2-fold compared with placebo.
B	Platelet activation is involved in the pathophysiology of arterial thromboses more than venous thromboses , but aspirin may reduce VTE risk associated with estrogen use.
B	This analysis examines the effects of concomitant antiplatelet therapy on VTE risk in raloxifene-treated women.
M	In the Raloxifene Use for the Heart ( RUTH ) trial , 10 ,101 postmenopausal women from 177 sites in 26 countries at increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) ( primary prevention cohort ) or with CHD ( secondary prevention cohort ) were randomized to placebo or raloxifene 60mg/day and followed for a median 5.6 years.
M	Reports of clinical symptoms of VTE were assessed.
M	Concomitant use of antiplatelet agents ( aspirin , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , dipyridamole ) was allowed.
M	Cox proportional hazard models , with use of warfarin , presence of fracture , and hospitalization as covariates , were used to estimate hazard ratios ( HR ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CI ).
R	Overall , raloxifene use was associated with an increased VTE risk ( HR 1.44 , 95% CI 1.06-1.95 ) vs. placebo.
R	Most women ( 72% ) reported using aspirin , and 14.2% reported using nonaspirin antiplatelet agents during the study period.
R	Users of antiplatelet agents were older , more likely to have CHD , and more likely to be hyperlipidemic.
R	They had a higher VTE risk than nonusers.
R	No difference in VTE risk was observed in women who used raloxifene alone vs. those who used raloxifene with antiplatelet agents during the study.
R	The increase in VTE risk with raloxifene compared with placebo was not different between women who used antiplatelet agents at baseline ( HR 1.44 , 95% CI 0.98 , 2.10 ) and those who did not use antiplatelet agents ( HR 1.37 , 95% CI 0.83 , 2.27 ) ( interaction p = 0.88 ).
R	Similar conclusions were noted for aspirin and nonaspirin antiplatelet use.
C	In RUTH , postmenopausal women treated with raloxifene had an increased risk of VTE compared with placebo.
C	Concomitant use of aspirin or nonaspirin antiplatelet agents along with raloxifene did not change VTE risk.
B	There is a drive to improve the quality of service provision for patients with diabetes and to enable better self-management of this condition.
B	The adoption of prescribing by nurses is increasing worldwide and can potentially enhance service provision.
B	Evidence suggests that patients prefer services where their lifestyle factors and opinions are considered by healthcare professionals within a partnership approach.
B	Few studies have explored patients' views about their consultations with a nurse prescriber.
P	To explore the views patients with diabetes have about their consultations with nurse prescribers and any impact this may have on their medications management.
M	A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis.
M	Six primary care sites in which nurses prescribed medications for patients with diabetes in England.
M	Data was collected in 2009.
M	Interviews took place with 41 patients with diabetes from the case loads of 7 nurse prescribers.
R	Findings are reported under three themes ; the nurse consultation style , benefits of the nurse prescriber consultation and views on involvement and decision-making.
R	Key aspects of the nurse consultation style were a non-hurried approach , care and rapport , approachability , continuity , and providing clear information based on specialist knowledge.
R	Many benefits were described , including improved access to appropriate advice and medication , greater understanding and ability to self-manage , ability to address problems and improved confidence , trust and wellbeing.
R	While patients were happy with the amount of information received and involvement they had decisions about their treatment , there was some controversy over the consistency of information provided on side-effects of treatment.
C	The study provides new knowledge about what patients with diabetes value and benefit from in respect to care provided by nurse prescribers.
C	Continuity of relationship , flexibility over consultation length , nurses' interpersonal skills and specialist diabetes knowledge were identified as crucial to good quality care.
C	Patients require that nurse prescribers are skilled in providing a person-centred approach and have access to specialist training.
C	The level of information and involvement offered to patients should reflect patients' requirements.

B	The relationship between trait mindfulness and substance use behaviors has been inconsistent across studies.
B	The current meta-analysis aimed at quantifying the magnitude of this relationship , and at determining how this relationship varies in context of ( 1 ) mindfulness facets , ( 2 ) substance type , ( 3 ) sample characteristics , and ( 4 ) substance use severity.
M	Using electronic databases , the literature search yielded 303 articles , but only 39 articles met inclusion criteria to be included in this meta-analysis.
M	The relationship was quantified as a Pearson's r correlation coefficient for all studies.
R	Findings indicated a small , negative , and significant trait mindfulness-substance use behaviors relationship ( r = -0.13 ).
R	This relationship varied across substance type , clinical status of the sample , and substance use severity.
R	Mindfulness facet was not a significant moderator ; however , only particular facets ( e.g. , acting with awareness , non-judgment , and non-reactivity ) were consistently associated with substance use behaviors.
C	This meta-analysis quantified the trait mindfulness-substance use behaviors relationship , which can be used as future effect size estimates.
C	Findings also indicated that the trait mindfulnes-ssubstance use behaviors relationship was more robust: ( 1 ) for alcohol and tobacco use compared to marijuana use behaviors ; ( 2 ) for problematic compared to non-problematic substance use behaviors ; and ( 3 ) with inpatient compared to outpatient and non-clinical samples.
C	Further work should continue to examine if acting with awareness , non-judgment , and non-reactivity mindfulness facets are more robustly associated with substance use behaviors.
C	Failure to consider these factors , or collapsing across these factors , could explain the smaller or inconsistently reported associations across previous studies.

B	An effectiveness assessment on ASCT in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer identified serious ethical issues associated with this intervention.
B	Our objective was to systematically review these aspects by means of a literature analysis.
M	We chose the reflexive Socratic approach as the review method using Hofmann's question list , conducted a comprehensive literature search in biomedical , psychological and ethics bibliographic databases and screened the resulting hits in a 2-step selection process.
M	Relevant arguments were assembled from the included articles , and were assessed and assigned to the question list.
M	Hofmann's questions were addressed by synthesizing these arguments.
R	Of the identified 879 documents 102 included arguments related to one or more questions from Hofmann's question list.
R	The most important ethical issues were the implementation of ASCT in clinical practice on the basis of phase-II trials in the 1990s and the publication of falsified data in the first randomized controlled trials ( Bezwoda fraud ) , which caused significant negative effects on recruiting patients for further clinical trials and the doctor-patient relationship.
R	Recent meta-analyses report a marginal effect in prolonging disease-free survival , accompanied by severe harms , including death.
R	ASCT in breast cancer remains a stigmatized technology.
R	Reported health-related-quality-of-life data are often at high risk of bias in favor of the survivors.
R	Furthermore little attention has been paid to those patients who were dying.
C	The questions were addressed in different degrees of completeness.
C	All arguments were assignable to the questions.
C	The central ethical dimensions of ASCT could be discussed by reviewing the published literature.
B	Safety-net and teaching hospitals are somewhat more likely to be penalized for excess readmissions , but the association of other hospital characteristics with readmission rates is uncertain and may have relevance for hospital-centered interventions.
P	To examine the independent association of 8 hospital characteristics with hospital-wide 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate ( RSRR ).
M	This is a retrospective cross-sectional multivariable analysis.
M	US hospitals.
M	Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services specification of hospital-wide RSRR from July 1 , 2013 through June 30 , 2014 with race and Medicaid dual-eligibility added.
R	We included 6 ,789 ,839 admissions to 4474 hospitals of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged over 64 years.
R	In multivariable analyses , there was regional variation: hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region had the highest RSRRs [0.98 percentage points higher than hospitals in the Mountain region ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.84-1.12].
R	For-profit hospitals had an average RSRR 0.38 percentage points ( 95% CI , 0.24-0.53 ) higher than public hospitals.
R	Both urban and rural hospitals had higher RSRRs than those in medium metropolitan areas.
R	Hospitals without advanced cardiac surgery capability had an average RSRR 0.27 percentage points ( 95% CI , 0.18-0.36 ) higher than those with.
R	The ratio of registered nurses per hospital bed was not associated with RSRR.
R	Variability in RSRRs among hospitals of similar type was much larger than aggregate differences between types of hospitals.
C	Overall , larger , urban , academic facilities had modestly higher RSRRs than smaller , suburban , community hospitals , although there was a wide range of performance.
C	The strong regional effect suggests that local practice patterns are an important influence.
C	Disproportionately high readmission rates at for-profit hospitals may highlight the role of financial incentives favoring utilization.
B	Although smoking is the most common cannabis administration route , vaporization and consumption of cannabis edibles are common.
B	Few studies directly compare cannabis' subjective and physiological effects following multiple administration routes.
M	Subjective and physiological effects , and expired carbon monoxide ( CO ) were evaluated in frequent and occasional cannabis users following placebo ( 0.001% Delta( 9 )-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] ) , smoked , vaporized , and oral cannabis ( 6.9% THC , similar to 54 mg ).
R	Participants' subjective ratings were significantly elevated compared to placebo after smoking and vaporization , while only occasional smokers' ratings were significantly elevated compared to placebo after oral dosing.
R	Frequent smokers' maximum ratings were significantly different between inhaled and oral routes , while no differences in occasional smokers' maximum ratings between active routes were observed.
R	Additionally , heart rate increases above baseline 0.5 h after smoking ( mean 12.2 bpm ) and vaporization ( 10.7 bpm ) , and at 1.5 h ( 13.0 bpm ) and 3 h ( 10.2 bpm ) after oral dosing were significantly greater than changes after placebo , with no differences between frequent and occasional smokers.
R	Finally , smoking produced significantly increased expired CO concentrations 0.25-6 h post-dose compared to vaporization.
C	All participants had significant elevations in subjective effects after smoking and vaporization , but only occasional smokers after oral cannabis , indicating partial tolerance to subjective effects with frequent exposure.
C	There were no differences in occasional smokers' maximum subjective ratings across the three active administration routes.
C	Vaporized cannabis , is an attractive alternative for medicinal administrations over smoking or oral routes ; effects occur quickly and doses can be titrated with minimal CO exposure.
C	These results have strong implications for safety and abuse liability assessments.
P	This qualitative study focused on the perceptions of family members of children with dysphagia by asking what the family-identified factors are that facilitate or inhibit effective school-based management of pediatric dysphagia.
M	Semistructured interviews of 7 family members of 6 children with dysphagia , ages 2 through 11 years , were conducted.
M	Collective case study and cross-case analyses were conducted.
M	The findings were confirmed through triangulation , respondent validation , and member checking.
R	Interviewees identified 5 facilitating factors that enhance school-based dysphagia programs: ( a ) setting , ( b ) therapist and/or program , ( c ) capitalizing on positive child characteristics , ( d ) home-school interactions , and ( e ) external supports.
R	Four factors that inhibit effectiveness also emerged: ( a ) setting , ( b ) therapist and/or program , ( c ) limiting child characteristics , and ( d ) home-school interactions.
C	Practitioners may consider addressing the factors that were identified as facilitators of effective programs.
C	More research is needed concerning ( a ) factors promoting effective parent-professional relationships , ( b ) methods for increasing professional preparation in pediatric dysphagia , and ( c ) the efficacy of school-based pediatric dysphagia management programs.
B	Over the last two decades , the number of countries where nurses are legally permitted to prescribe medication has grown considerably.
B	A lack of peer support and/or objections by physicians can act as factors hampering nurse prescribing.
B	Earlier research suggests that physicians are generally less supportive and more concerned about nurse prescribing than nurses are.
B	However , direct comparisons between doctors' and nurses' views are scarce and are often based on small sample sizes.
P	To gain insight into the views of Dutch registered nurses ( RNs ) , nurse specialists ( with a master's in Advanced Nursing Practice ) and physicians on the consequences of nurse prescribing.
M	Survey study.
M	Survey questionnaires were sent to national samples of RNs , nurse specialists and physicians.
M	The questionnaire addressed , among others , respondents' general views on the consequences of nurse prescribing for the quality of care , the nursing and medical professions , and the relationship between the medical and nursing professions.
R	The net response rate was 66.0% for RNs ( n=617 ) , 28.3% for nurse specialists ( n = 375 ) and 33.7% for physicians ( n = 265 ).
R	It was found that all groups agreed that nurse prescribing benefits nurses' daily practice and the nursing profession.
R	There were few concerns about negative consequences for physicians' practice and the medical profession.
R	Nurse specialists gave significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more positive scores on most items than RNs and physicians.
R	We found relatively little difference in views between RNs and physicians.
R	It was only on issues surrounding the quality of care and patient safety that doctors showed more concerns , albeit mild , than RNs and nurse specialists.
C	RNs , nurse specialists and physicians generally hold neutral to moderately positive views on nurse prescribing.
C	This is beneficial for the implementation and potential success of nurse prescribing in practice , as a lack of peer support and/or objections from physicians can be a hampering factor.
C	However , concerns about the consequences of nurse prescribing for the quality of care and patient safety remain a point for attention , especially among physicians.

B	Exhaustion is a concept of interest for both occupational health research and stress-disease theory research.
B	The aim of the present study was to explore associations between chronic stressors , in terms of psychosocial working conditions , and exhaustion in a Swedish middle-aged population sample.
M	A vocationally active population sample of the Malmo Shoulder and Neck Study cohort , comprising 2555 men and 2466 women between 45 and 64 years of age , was used.
M	Psychosocial working conditions , assessed by means of the demand-control-support model , were measured longitudinally with a 1-year interval.
M	Exhaustion was assessed by the SF-36 vitality scale and measured at follow-up , yielding a cross-sectional study design.
R	Exhaustion was twice as common in women as in men.
R	High psychological job demands , low job control and low job support were independently associated with exhaustion in both men and women.
R	These associations remained after controlling for a variety of potential confounders and mediators , including socio-demographic factors , lifestyle factors , musculoskeletal pain , disease , other work-related factors ( including physical workload ) and non-work-related factors.
R	High demands in combination with low control ( job strain ) , and job strain combined with low job support ( iso-strain ) , increased the risk for exhaustion.
C	Psychosocial working conditions seem to contribute to exhaustion in middle-aged men and women.
C	Future research should include exploration of exhaustion as a possible mediator between work stress and disease , as well as exploration of other chronic stressors , including non-work-related stressors , regarding their effects on exhaustion in men and women.
P	To explore facilitating and inhibiting factors in the inpatient care of patients with functional neurological disorders as experienced by interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals.
M	Qualitative focus group interviews were conducted with 18 healthcare professionals of various professions.
M	Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with inductive coding of data.
R	Two main categories were formulated: ( a ) Giving the diagnosis to patients - a moment of fragility and opportunities , and ( b ) Organization of care - ensuring the continuity and protecting patients' self-image.
R	One overarching theme tied the two categories together: Establishing coherence in the inpatient trajectory - moving from stigmatization toward competent care.
R	Coherence and steadiness in care was a prerequisite for transparency in goalsetting and for designating the responsibilities of individual healthcare professionals.
R	Stigma and having clinical experience and knowledge of functional neurological disorders , as two counter-factors , influenced the extent to which this was achieved.
R	Examples of facilitating factors for enhancing competent care were documentation of symptoms , effective ways of passing on clinical information , education , professional dialog , and organizational support.
C	To nurture competent care , guidelines , structured educational initiatives and other supportive actions should be promoted.
C	We provide ideas for the next logical steps for clinical practice and research.
B	Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) is a common disorder that has a complex and heterogeneous etiology.
B	Some evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress may have a pathophysiological link.
B	Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBOT ) has been proposed as a possible therapy.
B	Because HBOT is an expensive treatment with significant commercial opportunity , it is essential for it to have a research evidence base prior to widespread use.
P	To conduct a systematic review of the literature evaluating the clinical impact of HBOT on behavior and development in ASD with a view to inform practice.
M	A literature search of electronic scientific databases focusing on clinical outcomes of HBOT in ASD was performed.
M	Articles meeting inclusion criteria were independently assessed by reviewers and were classified according to the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines.
M	Recommendations were made based on the evidence.
R	Five articles were reviewed with data extraction.
R	Based on the AAN Classification of Recommendations the data supported a rating of "A" , indicating that HBOT is not effective for treating children and youth with ASD.
C	Current evidence does not support HBOT as an effective treatment for children and youth with ASD.

P	The sales literature shows that motivation is a key determinant of salesperson performance.
P	The literature also suggests that how managers use social power will have an effect on important organizational outcomes , including salesperson performance.
P	This study examines the five bases of social power that sales managers use ( reward , coercive , legitimate , referent , and expert ) as moderating influences in the salesperson motivation ( extrinsic and intrinsic )salesperson performance linkage.Methodology/approach: Data was collected from 128 salespeople using a cross industry survey.
P	Eight hypotheses were developed and tested using SmartPLS ( partial least squares ).
R	The authors found support for five of eight hypotheses.
R	Results and significant findings suggest that sales managers can impact sales performance in extrinsically motivated salespeople by using coercive and legitimate power.
R	For intrinsically motivated salespeople , sales managers can impact sales performance by using coercive , legitimate , and referent power.Research implications: Related to social power theory , the study suggests that salesperson performance is dependent upon a salesperson's combined motivation orientation and the base of power used by the sales manager.
R	The study also sets the stage for subsequent research on how managerial power can be studied as a moderator for other personal salesperson characteristics ( e.g. , self-esteem , self-efficacy , locus of control ) and salesperson performance.
R	In addition , understanding how these other personal characteristics interact with managerial bases of power to produce other organizational outcomes ( e.g. , job satisfaction , organizational commitment ) are questions that sales researchers may wish to pursue via further study.
C	For practicing sales managers , the research study can provide guidance as to how they may tailor their use of power to best impact salesperson performance.
C	For a manager to understand the motivational makeup of each salesperson , open communication and dialogue must occur at the onset of their relationship.
C	Having the knowledge of what drives each salesperson , a manager can modify their leadership style ( and choice of power base ) to suit the situation.
C	Customizing these sales management approaches may also have long-term benefits for the organization as studies show that doing so can lead to reduced levels of turnover as well as increased levels of performance.Contribution of the article: This study is important to sales research , theory , and practice.
C	The authors contribute to the selling and sales management literature by extending motivation and social power theories into the sales domain by showing that managerial power may be a key moderating determinant between a salesperson's motivation and his/her sales performance.
C	For practicing sales managers , we provide some insight and guidance for understanding how to throttle or moderate their use of various social power bases when dealing with individual salespeople who may differ in their motivation orientation , age , and degree of selling experience.
B	This study examined racial differences in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors and their associations with sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) among recent heroin-using and cocaine-using women.
M	Participants were 214 women ( 59% black , 41% white ) who were recruited during 2002-2010 using targeted sampling to participate in a study in Baltimore , Maryland , and reported using heroin , cocaine , or crack during the previous 6 months.
M	Participants completed self-report questionnaires about their drug use , sexual risk behaviors , and lifetime history of one of six STDs , including gonorrhea , syphilis , chlamydia , genital herpes , genital warts , or trichomoniasis.
R	More black women ( 50% ) than white women ( 28% ) reported a lifetime STD.
R	Although there were no racial differences in the lifetime prevalence of sexual risk behaviors assessed , there were racial differences in the sexual behaviors associated with ever having a lifetime STD.
R	Simple logistic regressions revealed that ever having a casual sex partner or anal sex were correlates of having a lifetime STD among black women but not among white women.
R	Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that ever having a casual sex partner was significantly associated with having a lifetime STD among black women , and ever trading sex for money was significantly associated with having a lifetime STD among white women.
C	Findings are consistent with national studies and elucidate racial disparities in STDs and associated sexual behaviors among recent heroin-using and cocaine-using women.
C	Findings underscore the need to tailor STD prevention interventions differently for black and white recent heroin-using and cocaine-using women.
P	To explore experiences , barriers , and facilitators to participating in physical activity and exercise in adults living with chronic pain.
M	An interpretive description qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted.
M	Participants included adults living with chronic pain ( pain >3?
M	months in duration ).
M	Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis.
R	Sixteen participants ( five men ; 11 women ) with a median age of 53?
R	years ( range: 28?
R	87 ) were interviewed.
R	Three major themes related to physical activity and exercise in adults living with chronic pain were conceptualized by the researchers: the challenge of staying active ( decreased activity levels , discomfort during physical activity , and uncertain and fluctuating abilities ) ; diverse factors influence participation ( pain , fatigue , perceived risks , beliefs about physical activity , competing demands , social support , motivation , other health conditions , and access to supports for physical activity or exercise ) ; and perceived outcomes ( pain management , functional improvements , social participation , mental health , and overall well-being ).
C	Participating in physical activity and exercise was a challenge for adults living with chronic pain , whereby participation was influenced by multiple factors.
C	Rehabilitation providers should aim to reduce modifiable barriers to physical activity and exercise for adults living with chronic pain , with the goal of improving health outcomes for this population.
B	The benefit of unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) added to aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) was described more than 20 years ago.
B	Ever since , a wide variety of anticoagulant drugs have become available for clinical use , including low-molecular-weight heparins ( LMWH ) , direct thrombin inhibitors and selective factor Xa inhibitors.
P	The aim of this study was to critically review the available evidence on the cost and incremental cost effectiveness of anticoagulants in patients with ACS.
M	Studies were identified using specialist databases ( UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED] and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis [CEA] Registry ) , PubMed and the reference lists of recovered articles.
M	Only studies based on randomized controlled trials were considered for inclusion.
M	Finally , 22 studies were included in the review.
R	Enoxaparin is the only LMWH that has been shown to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with non-ST-elevation ACS ( NSTE-ACS ).
R	In economic studies based on the ESSENCE trial conducted in the late 1990s , enoxaparin was consistently associated with a lower risk of coronary events , a reduction in the number of revascularization procedures and a lower cost per patient than UFH.
R	However , these results refer to patients managed conservatively , with little use of thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors , and the results are difficult to extrapolate to moderate-to-high-risk patients managed with the present day early invasive strategy.
R	Available studies of LMWH in ACS with persistent elevation of ST-segment ( STE-ACS ) are limited to patients treated with thrombolysis.
R	In this scenario , enoxaparin was shown to be a dominant alternative compared with UFH in a study based on the ASSENT-3 study and was considered an economically attractive alternative in three studies based on the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study.
R	However , these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of the supportive randomized trials and the possible underestimation of bleeding costs.
R	The effectiveness and safety of bivalirudin , a direct thrombin inhibitor , were evaluated in the ACUITY study ( NSTE-ACS patients managed invasively ) and the HORIZONS-AMI study ( STE acute myocardial infarction patients planned for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ).
R	Bivalirudin monotherapy was not inferior to heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and reduced the risk of major bleeding.
R	The economic evaluations based on these studies suggest that bivalirudin is an attractive alternative to heparin plus a glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa inhibitor.
R	In the OASIS-5 trial , compared with enoxaparin , fondaparinux reduced the mortality in patients with NSTE-ACS , probably because of a reduced risk Of bleeding.
R	In three economic evaluations of fondaparinux versus enoxaparin based on this trial , fondaparinux was the dominant strategy in two of them , and still economically attractive in a third.
R	Taken as a whole , the usefulness of economic studies of anticoagulants in patients with ACS is undermined by the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness and safety ; the narrow spectrum of the analysed scenarios ; the lack of economic evaluations based on systematic reviews ; the limitations of sensitivity analyses reported by the available economic evaluations ; and their substantial risk of commercial bias.
C	The available studies suggest that enoxaparin is an economically attractive alternative compared with UFH in patients with NSTE-ACS treated conservatively and STE-ACS patients treated with thrombolysis.
C	Bivalirudin in patients with ACS treated invasively is cost effective compared with heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.
C	In patients with NSTE-ACS , fondaparinux is cost effective compared with enoxaparin.
C	The usefulness of these results for decision making in contemporary clinical practice is limited due to problems of internal and external validity.
B	The use of mortality report cards as the basis for hospital choice assumes that a hospital's current performance is predicted by its past performance.
P	To assess the accuracy of hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates reported in the New York State ( NYS ) coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) report card for predicting subsequent hospital mortality.
M	We performed a retrospective study based on hospital mortality measures for CABG surgery ( n = 37 hospitals ) in NYS , which are publicly reported by the NYS Department of Health.
M	Feasible generalized least squares was used to examine the association between a hospital's past quality ranking ( high-quality , intermediate- quality , low-quality ) and its subsequent performance , as measured using the ratio of the observed-to-expected mortality rate ( O-to-E ratio ).
R	Hospitals identified as low-mortality hospitals using 2-year-old data had subsequent O-to-E ratios that were 16.8% lower ( 95% confidence interval , 8.9-24.8 ; P < 0.001 ) than average-mortality hospitals , whereas hospitals identified as high-mortality hospitals had subsequent O-to-E ratios that were 31.8% higher ( 95% confidence interval , 3.69-59.9 ; P < 0.05 ) compared with average-mortality hospitals.
R	Hospitals identified as high-mortality hospitals using 3-year-old data were indistinguishable from average-mortality hospitals.
C	Hospital ranking based on 2-year-old data is a strong predictor of future performance.
C	Report cards based on 3-year-old data may not be useful for identifying low-performance hospitals.
C	We recommend that the CABG report cards in NYS should be based on 2-year-old data , as opposed to the current practice of basing them on either 2- or 3-year-old data.
B	Transition to practice is a major concern for nurse educators , health care executives , and new nursing graduates.
B	The disparity of nurse educators' and leaders' perceptions regarding new graduates' abilities to perform procedural skills may lead to patient harm.
B	Pay for performance , quality indicators , and decreased reimbursement related to catheter-associated urinary tract infections have increased the need for competency validation.
M	A quantitative method with a descriptive correlational design provided information about the relationship of self-efficacy of the new nursing graduate and competency in urinary catheterization.
M	Following a self-efficacy inquiry , a high-fidelity simulation was conducted for individual evaluation of the psychomotor skill of urinary catheterization.
R	Analysis with nonparametric statistics for correlation indicated a lack of statistical significance (  p >.05 ) between self-efficacy and competency in the psychomotor skill of urinary catheterization.
C	This study indicates that there is a need for validating competency in psychomotor skills within the context of a simulated patient care situation.
C	The appropriate use of high-fidelity simulation may include incorporating self-efficacy measurements with an objective evaluation of psychomotor abilities to improve patient outcomes while increasing the accountability of the nurse.

P	In this paper we make the case for the importance of adolescent sexual health research , and argue that requiring parental consent for adolescent participation may ( a ) be unwarranted , ( b ) be inconsistent with the principles of justice and inclusiveness , ( c ) be confusing , and ( d ) serve to silence young people who most need to have a voice in sexual health research.
M	Through a case study of the Toronto Teen Survey , we offer concrete suggestions and alternatives for protecting adolescent health research participants in community-based settings and promoting ethical research approaches.
R	Strategies suggested include: ( 1 ) adopting a community-based participatory research approach , ( 2 ) careful attention to youth-friendly protocols and consent procedures , ( 3 ) proper training of all research staff and peer researchers , ( 4 ) partnering with experienced community based youth-serving agencies , ( 5 ) paying maximum attention to issues of confidentiality and anonymity , and ( 6 ) valuing participation appropriately.
C	Institutional review boards and researchers should be encouraged to adopt localized context-dependent strategies that attend to the unique vulnerabilities of their particular study populations.
C	Attention to flexibility , vulnerability , and community-specific needs is necessary to ensure appropriate ethical research practices that attend to the health and well-being of young people.

P	The National Eating Disorders Quality Improvement Collaborative evaluated data of patients with restrictive eating disorders to analyze demographics of diagnostic categories and predictors of weight restoration at 1 year.
M	Fourteen Adolescent Medicine eating disorder programs participated in a retrospective review of 700 adolescents aged 9-21 years with three visits , with DSM-5 categories of restrictive eating disorders including anorexia nervosa ( AN ) , atypical AN , and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder ( ARFID ).
M	Data including demographics , weight and height at intake and follow-up , treatment before intake , and treatment during the year of follow-up were analyzed.
R	At intake , 53.6% met criteria for AN , 33.9% for atypical AN , and 12.4% for ARFID.
R	Adolescents with ARFID were more likely to be male , younger , and had a longer duration of illness before presentation.
R	All sites had a positive change in mean percentage median body mass index ( %MBMI ) for their population at 1-year follow-up.
R	Controlling for age , gender , duration of illness , diagnosis , and prior higher level of care , only %MBMI at intake was a significant predictor of weight recovery.
R	In the model , there was a 12.7% change in %MBMI ( interquartile range , 6.5-19.3 ).
R	Type of treatment was not predictive , and there were no significant differences between programs in terms of weight restoration.
C	The National Eating Disorders Quality Improvement Collaborative provides a description of the patient population presenting to a national cross-section of 14 Adolescent Medicine eating disorder programs and categorized by DSM-5.
C	Treatment modalities need to be further evaluated to assess for more global aspects of recovery.

B	The Israeli National Health Insurance Law was amended in 2010 to require the disclosure of payments above 2500 NIS from pharmaceutical companies ( PCs ) to medical personnel and organizations.
B	We examined if the law had an impact on the relationship between physicians in the Israeli health system and the pharmaceutical industry.
M	We conducted 42 in-depth semi-structured interviews with representatives of relevant stakeholders regarding the effects and extent of the law and the interviewees' attitudes about regulating the relationship between physicians and PCs.
M	In addition , we analyzed reports on payments from PCs to various components of the health system.
R	The majority of interviewees agreed that transparency is important to the relationship between PCs and physicians and none of them opposed the disclosure of payments.
R	Most interviewees reported to have witnessed a change in the regulatory climate of the relationship between PCs and physicians , prompted mostly by self-regulatory measures of the pharmaceutical industry.
R	The most significant change in this relationship appeared to be the enactment of contractual relations between PCs and physicians.
R	There was a pervasive feeling that self-regulation is more effective than state regulation.
R	The impact of the law on the behavior of individual physicians was claimed to be limited at best.
R	Suggested causes were lack of awareness of the law , particularly among physicians ; ambiguous definition of "payments" and loopholes in the law that attract other forms of remuneration to physicians and lack of enforcement of the law.
R	According to reports published by the Ministry of Health , Pharma Israel , and the Israeli Medical association , although there had been some disclosure of payments by both donors and beneficiaries , there were inconsistencies between the total payments disclosed by PCs and those disclosed by their beneficiaries.
C	There is a broad agreement that transparency is important to the PCs-physicians relationship.
C	In addition , it seems that there was a change in the regulatory climate of that relationship ; however , the feeling among the stakeholders is that self-regulation is more effective than state regulation.
C	Therefore , efforts should focus on enforcement of the law and deterrence of its violations , possibly by investigating discrepancies between disclosed payment by donors and beneficiaries.
C	The law should be amended to close loopholes.
C	Furthermore , there should be periodic follow up of relevant databases , and relevant stakeholders should be interviewed in order to seek feedback and identify problems in implementation.
B	Relatively little is known about how depression amongst people with chronic illness is identified and managed in diverse primary health care settings.
B	We evaluated the role of complex physical needs in influencing current practice of depression screening , documentation and antidepressant prescriptions during a 12-month period , among adults with Type 2 diabetes attending Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary care health centres in Australia.
M	We analysed clinical audit data from 44 health centres participating in a continuous quality improvement initiative , using previously reported standard sampling and data extraction protocols.
M	Eligible patients were those with Type 2 diabetes with health centre attendance within the past 12 months.
M	We compared current practice in depression screening , documentation and antidepressant prescription between patients with different disease severity and co-morbidity.
M	We used random effects multiple logistic regression models to adjust for potential confounders and for clustering by health centre.
R	Among the 1174 patients with diabetes included , median time since diagnosis was 7 years , 19% of patients had a co-existing diagnosis of Ischaemic Heart Disease and 1/3 had renal disease.
R	Some 70% of patients had HbAc1>7.0% ; 65% had cholesterol >4.0 mmol1-1 and 64% had blood pressure> 130/80 mmHg.
R	Documentation of screening for depression and of diagnosed depression were low overall ( 5% and 6% respectively ) and lower for patients with renal disease ( Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.21 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14 to 0.31 and AOR 0.34 ; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75 ) , and for those with poorly controlled disease ( HbA1c>7.00 ( AOR 0.40 ; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68 and AOR 0.51 ; 95% CI 0.30 to 84 ) ).
R	Screening for depression was lower for those on pharmaceutical treatment for glycaemic control compared to those not on such treatment.
R	Antidepressant prescription was not associated with level of diabetes control or disease severity.
C	Background levels of depression screening and documentation were low overall and significantly lower for patients with greater disease severity.
C	Strategies to improve depression care for vulnerable populations are urgently required.
C	An important first step in the Australian Indigenous primary care context is to identify and address barriers to the use of current clinical guidelines for depression screening and care.
P	We evaluated changes in and factors affecting second-hand smoke ( SHS ) exposure in a panel study of nonsmokers.
M	This study was based on data from a larger study of tobacco use among a representative sample of adults of Korean descent residing in California.
M	Participants included 846 males and 1 ,399 females who were nonsmokers at baseline ( 2005-2006 ) and at follow-up ( 2007-2009 ).
M	Participants were selected by probability sampling and were interviewed by telephone.
R	At baseline , 50.0% were exposed to any SHS , and at follow-up 2 years later , 60.4% were exposed to any SHS ( p < .001 ).
R	SHS expbsure at baseline was associated with acculturation , employment , spousal smoking , and having a friend who smoked ( p < .001 ).
R	Employment , spousal smoking , and other family members smoking were associated with SHS at follow-up ( p < .001 ).
R	The odds ratio of SHS in the employed group declined from 2.01 at baseline to 1.53 at follow-up , that of the group having a smoking spouse increased from 1.88 to 2.36 , and that of the group having other family members smoking increased from 1.20 to 1.69.
C	We showed that SHS exposure increased among Korean American nonsmokers in California , and the most important variables explaining the change in SHS exposure involved smoking among others with whom the subject is associated.
C	These findings could be used as objective evidence for developing public health policies to reduce SHS exposure.

P	This study tested two hypotheses about gender-specific mental health effects of peer stressors during early adolescence: ( 1 ) boys and girls are sensitive to different types of peer stressors , and ( 2 ) peer stress is associated with different mental health problems in boys and girls.
M	These two hypotheses were tested in a prospective large population cohort of 2 ,084 Dutch young adolescents.
M	Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured at baseline and follow-up , whereas stressful life events in the period between baseline and follow-up were measured retrospectively at follow-up.
M	We performed the analyses with two types of peer stressors ; victimization at school and relationship losses.
R	Relationship losses were more strongly associated with internalizing and externalizing problems in girls than boys , supporting the first hypothesis.
R	Peer victimization at school was also associated with both types of mental health problems , but equally strong in boys and girls.
C	Peer stress is unlikely to be associated with different mental health problems in boys and girls.
C	Instead , boys and girls are more likely to be susceptible to different types of peer stressors.

P	Speech produced by individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease ( PD ) is characterized by a number of features including impaired speech prosody.
P	The purpose of this study was to investigate intonation contrasts produced by this group of speakers.
M	Speech materials with a question-statement contrast were collected from 14 Cantonese speakers with PD.
M	Twenty listeners then classified the productions as either questions or statements.
M	Acoustic analyses of F0 , duration , and intensity were conducted to determine which acoustic cues distinguished the production of questions from statements , and which cues appeared to be exploited by listeners in identifying intonational contrasts.
R	The results show that listeners identified statements with a high degree of accuracy , but the accuracy of question identification ranged from 0.56% to 96% across the 14 speakers.
R	The speakers with PD used similar acoustic cues as nondysarthric Cantonese speakers to mark the question-statement contrast , although the contrasts were not observed in all speakers.
R	Listeners mainly used F0 cues at the final syllable for intonation identification.
C	These data contribute to the researchers' understanding of intonation marking in speakers with PD , with specific application to the production and perception of intonation in a lexical tone language.
B	A statistical methodology is available to estimate the proportion of cell types ( cellular heterogeneity ) in adult whole blood specimens used in epigenome-wide association studies ( EWAS ).
B	However , there is no methodology to estimate the proportion of cell types in umbilical cord blood ( also a heterogeneous tissue ) used in EWAS.
P	The objectives of this study were to determine whether differences in DNA methylation ( DNAm ) patterns in umbilical cord blood are the result of blood cell type proportion changes that typically occur across gestational age and to demonstrate the effect of cell type proportion confounding by comparing preterm infants exposed and not exposed to antenatal steroids.
M	We obtained DNAm profiles of cord blood using the Illumina HumanMethylation27k BeadChip array for 385 neonates from the Boston Birth Cohort.
M	We estimated cell type proportions for six cell types using the deconvolution method developed by Houseman et al. ( 2012 ).
R	The cell type proportion estimates segregated into two groups that were significantly different by gestational age , indicating that gestational age was associated with cell type proportion.
R	Among infants exposed to antenatal steroids , the number of differentially methylated CpGs dropped from 127 to 1 after controlling for cell type proportion.
C	EWAS utilizing cord blood are confounded by cell type proportion.
C	Careful study design including correction for cell type proportion and interpretation of results of EWAS using cord blood are critical.
P	This study was conducted to develop and test a structural model of evidence-based practice ( EBP ) implementation among clinical nurses.
P	The model was based on Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt's Advancing Research and Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration model and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory.
M	Participants were 410 nurses recruited from ten different tertiary hospitals in Korea.
M	A structured self-report questionnaire was used to assess EBP knowledge/skills , EBP beliefs , EBP attitudes , organizational culture & readiness for EBP , dimensions of a learning organization and organizational innovativeness.
M	Collected data were analyzed using SPSS/WlNdows 20.0 and AMOS 20.0 program.
R	The modified research model provided a reasonable fit to the data.
R	Clinical nurses' EBP knowledge/skills , EBP beliefs , and the organizational culture & readiness for EBP had statistically significant positive effects on the implementation of EBP.
R	The impact of EBP attitudes was not significant.
R	The dimensions of the learning organization and organizational innovativeness showed statistically significant negative effects on EBP implementation.
R	These variables explained 32.8% of the variance of EBP implementation among clinical nurses.
C	The findings suggest that not only individual nurses' knowledge/skills of and beliefs about EBP but organizational EBP culture should be strengthened to promote clinical nurses' EBP implementation.
B	There are few studies of mortality amongst people who inject drugs ( PWID ) in Australia.
B	In this study , we estimate mortality in a cohort of PWID in Melbourne and examine predictors of mortality including health service use , demographic characteristics , drug use and personal wellbeing.
R	We linked identifiers from the Melbourne injecting drug use cohort study ( MIX ; n = 655 ) to the National Death Index from 2008 to 2012 to estimate standardised mortality ratios ( SMRs ).
R	Cox regression was used to examine the bivariate relationship between exposures determined at baseline and subsequent mortality.
R	There were 24 ( 3.6 % ) deaths over the study period.
R	The mortality rate in the cohort was 1.0 per 100 PY ( 95 % CI 0.71-1.57 ) , with an SMR of 17.3 ( 95 % CI 11.6-25.8 ).
R	Baseline reports of four or more lifetime incarcerations ( HR 3.65 , 95 % CI 1.16-11.52 ) , past month ambulance attendance ( HR 4.43 , 95 % CI 1.76-11.17 ) , past month emergency department presentation ( HR 3.44 , 95 % CI 1.47-8.03 ) and past 6-month self-reported heroin overdose ( HR 3.14 , 95 % CI 1.24-7.96 ) were associated with increased mortality risk.
C	Contact with emergency services , particularly for drug overdose , remains a lost opportunity to provide referrals for harm reduction and naloxone training programmes to PWID at greater risk of mortality.
P	This study examined factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ).
M	A total of 113 new mothers with very low-birth-weight infants in their initial NICU admission were recruited from 2 urban hospitals servicing low-income minority communities.
M	This study employed a cross-sectional design.
M	Data were collected during the infants' postpartum NICU admission and included maternal demographic information ( eg , age , education , race , living with the baby's father ) , infant illness severity ( Neurobiologic Risk Score from infant's medical record ) , and maternal psychological measures ( the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale , the Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Questionnaire , and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ).
R	The findings indicated that 47 ( 42% ) women had elevated postpartum depressive symptoms and 33 ( 30% ) women had elevated postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms ( PTSs ).
R	Factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms included PTS , anxiety , maternal age , and whether the mother lived with the baby's father ( F-4 ,F-104 = 52.27 , P < .001 ).
R	The severity of the infants' illness , parental stress , and maternal education were not associated with depressive symptoms among low-income mothers of NICU infants.
C	On the basis of our findings , we recommend that low-income women should be screened for symptoms of anxiety , posttraumatic stress , and postpartum depression on their infants' admission to the NICU.
C	When this is not feasible , we advise NICU healthcare providers to assess women for familial support , maternal age , posttraumatic stress related to their infants birth , and anxiety to determine which mothers are at the greatest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms.
C	Screening for postpartum depression in the NICU can aid in early identification and treatment , thereby decreasing negative consequences for mothers and their infants.
B	Spaced-repetition and test-enhanced learning are two methodologies that boost knowledge retention.
B	ALERT STUDENT is a platform that allows creation and distribution of Learning Objects named flashcards , and provides insight into student judgments-of-learning through a metric called 'recall accuracy'.
B	This study aims to understand how the spaced-repetition and test-enhanced learning features provided by the platform affect recall accuracy , and to characterize the effect that students , flashcards and repetitions exert on this measurement.
M	Three spaced laboratory sessions ( s0 , s1 and s2 ) , were conducted with n= 96 medical students.
M	The intervention employed a study task , and a quiz task that consisted in mentally answering open-ended questions about each flashcard and grading recall accuracy.
M	Students were randomized into study-quiz and quiz groups.
M	On s0 both groups performed the quiz task.
M	On s1 and s2 , the study-quiz group performed the study task followed by the quiz task , whereas the quiz group only performed the quiz task.
M	We measured differences in recall accuracy between groups/sessions , its variance components , and the G-coefficients for the flashcard component.
R	At s0 there were no differences in recall accuracy between groups.
R	The experiment group achieved a significant increase in recall accuracy that was superior to the quiz group in s1 and s2.
R	In the study-quiz group , increases in recall accuracy were mainly due to the session , followed by flashcard factors and student factors.
R	In the quiz group , increases in recall accuracy were mainly accounted by flashcard factors , followed by student and session factors.
R	The flashcard G-coefficient indicated an agreement on recall accuracy of 91% in the quiz group , and of 47% in the study-quiz group.
C	Recall accuracy is an easily collectible measurement that increases the educational value of Learning Objects and open-ended questions.
C	This metric seems to vary in a way consistent with knowledge retention , but further investigation is necessary to ascertain the nature of such relationship.
C	Recall accuracy has educational implications to students and educators , and may contribute to deliver tailored learning experiences , assess the effectiveness of instruction , and facilitate research comparing blended-learning interventions.
B	Individuals who use cocaine have fewer cognitive resources needed to maintain abstinence.
B	This is evidenced by blunted brain function during cognitive control tasks and reduced communication between brain regions associated with cognitive function.
B	For instance , relapse vulnerability is heightened in individuals with less communication between the right and left frontoparietal executive control network ( ECN ).
B	Given that recent cocaine use enhances such communication , it is plausible that recency of cocaine use influences interhemispheric ECN communication.
B	However , it is unclear whether ECN communication weakens over the course of early cocaine abstinence , which may then enhance relapse risk.
M	In ten men with cocaine use disorder , we conducted a preliminary assessment of the relationship between the number of days since last cocaine use ( 1-3 days ) and interhemispheric ECN coupling using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ).
R	Reduced interhemispheric ECN coupling was associated with increasing days since last cocaine use ; weaker coupling was also associated with lower urine cocaine metabolite concentrations.
R	This association was more prominent in prefrontal than parietal ECN-subregions.
C	Preliminary results indicate that resting state interhemispheric ECN coupling weakens within the first few days following last cocaine use.
C	Because of the known link between reduced ECN interhemispheric coupling and relapse vulnerability , these results suggest that relapse risk may increase the longer an individual abstains during an early quit attempt.
C	Treatments focused on reversing this coupling deficit may facilitate abstinence.
B	Delivery of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) prevention programs by community pharmacists appears effective and enhances health service access.
B	However , their capacity to implement complex behavioural change processes during patient counselling remains largely unexplored.
B	This study aims to determine intervention fidelity by pharmacists for behavioural components of a complex educational intervention for CVD prevention.
B	After receiving training to improve lifestyle and medicines adherence , pharmacists recruited 70 patients aged 50-74 years without established CVD , and taking antihypertensive or lipid lowering therapy.
B	Patients received five counselling sessions , each at monthly intervals.
B	Researchers assessed biomedical and behavioural risk factors at baseline and six months.
B	Pharmacists documented key outcomes from counselling after each session.
B	Most patients ( 86% ) reported suboptimal cardiovascular diets , 41% reported suboptimal medicines adherence , and 39% were physically inactive.
B	Of those advised to complete the intervention , 85% attended all five sessions.
B	Pharmacists achieved patient agreement with most recommended goals for behaviour change , and overwhelmingly translated goals into practical behavioural strategies.
B	Barriers to changing behaviours were regularly documented , and pharmacists reported most behavioural strategies as having had some success.
B	Meaningful improvements to health behaviours were observed post-intervention.
B	Findings support further exploration of pharmacists' potential roles for delivering interventions with complex behaviour change requirements.
B	Little is known about health care experiences among people with and without disabilities.
P	We sought to explore perceptions of people with and without disabilities related to their health care experiences.
M	Nineteen persons with and without disabilities participated in one of four focus groups.
M	Focus groups were conducted in the physical world in Milwaukee , WI and in the virtual world in Second Life ( R ) with Virtual Ability , a well-established community designed by and for people with a wide range of disabilities.
M	A grounded theory methodology was employed to analyze focus group data.
M	Inclusion of physical and virtual world focus groups enabled people with a wide range of disabilities to participate.
R	While some participants described instances of receiving good care , many discussed numerous barriers.
R	The main themes that emerged in focus groups among both persons with and without disabilities related to their health care experiences including poor coordination among providers ; difficulties with insurance , finances , transportation and facilities ; short duration of visits with physicians ; inadequate information provision ; feelings of being diminished and deflated ; and self-advocacy as a tool.
R	Transportation was a major concern for persons with disabilities influencing mobility.
R	Persons with disabilities described particularly poignant experiences wherein they felt invisible or were viewed as incompetent.
C	Both persons with and without disabilities experienced challenges in obtaining high quality health care.
C	However , persons with disabilities experienced specific challenges often related to their type of disability.
C	Participants stressed the need for improving health care coordination and the importance of self-advocacy.

B	Drunk or drug-impaired drivers represent a major public health and societal problem worldwide.
B	Because over 95% of drivers killed on the roads in Sweden are autopsied , reliable information is available about the use of alcohol and/or other drug before the crash.
M	This retrospective 4-year study ( 2008-2011 ) used a forensic toxicology database ( TOXBASE ) to evaluate the concentrations of alcohol and other drugs in blood samples from drivers killed in road-traffic crashes.
R	The mean age of all victims ( N = 895 ) was 48 +/- 20 years , and the majority were male ( 86% ).
R	In 504 drivers ( 56% ) , the results of toxicological analysis were negative and these victims were older ; mean age ( +/- SD ) 47 +/- 20 years , than alcohol positive cases ( 35 +/- 14 years ) and illicit drug users ( 34 +/- 15 years ).
R	In 21% of fatalities , blood-alcohol concentration ( BAC ) was above the statutory limit for driving ( 0.2 g/L ) , although the median BAC was appreciably higher ( 1.72 g/L ).
R	Illicit drugs ( mainly amphetamine and cannabis ) were identified in similar to 7% of victims , either alone ( 2.5% ) , together with alcohol ( 1.8% ) or a prescription drug ( 2% ).
R	The psychoactive prescription drugs identified were mainly benzodiazepines , z-hypnotics and tramadol , which were found in the blood of 7.6% of crash victims.
C	The high median BAC in fatally-injured drivers speaks strongly towards alcohol-induced impairment as being responsible for the crash.
C	Compared with alcohol , the prevalence of illicit and psychoactive prescription drugs was fairly low despite a dramatic increase in the number of drug-impaired drivers arrested by the police after a zero-tolerance law was introduced in 1999.
B	There is growing evidence that a palliative approach to care provision for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities improves their quality of life and provides support for family members.
B	Despite the development of Guidelines for a Palliative Approach in Residential Aged Care ( hereafter the Guidelines ) , there is limited evidence that these have been adopted.
B	To date , little research has been undertaken to explore processes which could assist aged care staff to develop their practice consistent with the intent of the Guidelines.
M	This project utilized an action research method , through which staff members from a residential dementia special care unit ( SCU ) undertook an investigation into their practice to explore how they could develop strategies to support a palliative approach to care provision.
M	A key focus was related to addressing the information needs of family members of residents on the SCU.
R	Aged care staff involved in this project had little understanding of available evidence that could assist them to better support family members , including the existence of the Guidelines.
R	Through their engagement in successive action research cycles , these staff accessed evidence-based resources and developed strategies to address the information needs of family members.
C	When provided with an opportunity to reflect on and critique their practice , aged care staff were better positioned to engage with evidence concerning a palliative approach and to execute change in their practice to improve care provision for family members.
B	An effective preceptor is a vital component of a strong learning experience for learners.
B	Many clinical preceptors provide on-site supervision and clinical teaching but lack the skills necessary to be effective teachers.
B	Few studies have examined the factors related to teaching competence among clinical nurse preceptors.
P	This article is a report of a study that examined ( a ) the differences in teaching competence by preceptor background , ( b ) the influence of locus of control on self-evaluated teaching competence , ( c ) the association between self-directed learning and self-evaluated teaching competence , and ( d ) the predictors of self-evaluated teaching competence among clinical nurse preceptors.
M	This descriptive and correlational study used a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 243 clinical nurse preceptors from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
M	Of these , 242 completed questionnaires for an effective response rate of 99.6%.
M	The self-evaluated Teaching Competencies Scale , Internal-External Scale , and Self-Directed Learning Instrument were used to assess teaching competencies and related factors among clinical nurse preceptors.
M	Descriptive statistics , one-way ANOVA , Mann-Whitney test , and multivariate linear regression were used to analyze data.
R	Clinical nurse preceptors averaged 4.03 in teaching competence , indicating a moderately above average score.
R	Higher teaching competence was associated with older age , being married , >10-year work experience , not assigned by unit manager , and good internal locus of control.
R	Self-directed learning significantly correlated with teaching competence ( r = .62 ).
R	Internal locus of control and self-directed learning were significant independent predictors of teaching competence after adjusting for age , marital status , total years as a clinical nurse preceptor , and willingness to be a clinical nurse preceptor.
R	Together , these accounted for 33.6% of teaching competence variance.
C	Nurse managers should recognize all factors and characteristics of clinical nurse preceptors that influence teaching competence to help achieve optimal learning outcomes for nursing staff and students.
B	The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children ( TSC-C ) is the most widely used self-report scale to assess trauma-related symptoms in children and adolescents on six clinical scales.
B	The purpose of the present study was to develop a German version of the TSC-C and to investigate its psychometric properties , such as factor structure , reliability , and validity , in a sample of German adolescents.
M	A normative sample of N = 583 and a clinical sample of N = 41 adolescents with a history of physical or sexual abuse aged between 13 and 21 years participated in the study.
R	The Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the six-factor model ( anger , anxiety , depression , dissociation , posttraumatic stress , and sexual concerns with the subdimensions preoccupation and distress ) revealed acceptable to good fit statistics in the normative sample.
R	One item had to be excluded from the German version of the TSC-C because the factor loading was too low.
R	All clinical scales presented acceptable to good reliability , with Cronbach's alpha's ranging from .80 to .86 in the normative sample and from .72 to .87 in the clinical sample.
R	Concurrent validity was also demonstrated by the high correlations between the TSC-C scales and instruments measuring similar psychopathology.
R	TSC-C scores reliably differentiated between adolescents with trauma history and those without trauma history , indicating discriminative validity.
C	In conclusion , the German version of the TSC-C is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing trauma-related symptoms on six different scales in adolescents aged between 13 and 21 years.
B	Our aim was to investigate the frequency of the behaviors that are most often associated with excess weight gain in Kuwaitis and to determine which gender and age groups are at highest risk for each behavior.
M	A questionnaire developed to identify barriers to exercise in western populations was modified for use with Kuwaitis and posted online during September through December 2012.
M	Data from 1370 adults 18 to 59 years old with BMIs ranging from 15.1-70.8 was collected.
M	The prevalence of seven behavior patterns was examined for age , BMI , and gender groups as well as the odds ratio of each behavior for each BMI group.
R	Both individual unhealthy exercise behaviors and the sum of all such behaviors were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals.
R	For all behaviors the odds ratio was significantly greater for those with BMIs of 30-39 than for those with BMIs below 25 ( P< 0.05 ).
R	Some exercise avoidance behaviors were more frequent in older age groups and in overweight females.
C	Unhealthy exercise behavior patterns were highly prevalent in obese individuals.
C	Tailoring programs and counseling to the most common of these patterns in Kuwaiti obese should facilitate greater success in weight management.
B	Alcohol dependence ( AD ) in developmentally vulnerable adolescents is ubiquitous and confers a risk for long-term neurocognitive sequelae , yet comorbid substance use disorders and psychopathology can complicate interpretations.
B	Here , we compare cognitive functioning in adolescents with and without AD , who are free from comorbicl disorders.
M	English- and Afrikaans-speaking adolescents ( 13-15 years ) of mixed ancestry and low socioeconomic status were recruited from the Cape Town region of South Africa.
M	Adolescents with psychiatric , developmental , or other substance use disorders ( SUDs ) were excluded.
M	AD ( n=26 ) and control ( n=26 ) groups were matched on age , gender , language , and level of education.
M	Neuropsychological testing in participants' home language followed detailed medical/psychiatric evaluation.
R	Although our sample included participants who smoked tobacco , lifetime dosage of other drugs was negligible.
R	When tobacco and other drug use as well as demographic variables were controlled , adolescents with AD performed more poorly on measures of Verbal Story Memory , Self-Monitoring , and Psychomotor Speed and Coordination.
C	These preliminary results , although relatively subtle , suggest that adolescents with AD may be at increased risk for failure to reach optimal levels of neuromaturation , and may be susceptible to cognitive problems associated with protracted alcohol consumption.

B	The continuity provided by longitudinal clerkships has documented benefits to medical student education.
B	Yet , little quantitative data exist on the association between longitudinal clerkships and patient outcomes.
P	This study compares screening metrics of a longitudinal clerkship called the education-centered medical home ( ECMH ) with the standard clinical model at a student-volunteer free clinic ( SVFC ).
P	In the ECMH model , the same attending physician staffs one half-day of clinic with same group of students weekly for 4 years.
P	Standard clinical models are staffed with students and physicians who come to the SVFC based on availability.
M	ECMH students aimed to increase human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) screening rates in their patient panel as part of a quality improvement project.
M	Students prepared individualized care plans prior to patient visits that included whether screening had been performed.
M	They were also reminded to confirm completion of testing.
M	Percentages of patients screened for HIV before and after establishment of the ECMH were compared with four standard clinical models.
M	Screening rates for breast , colon , and cervical cancer , as well as hepatitis C , served as secondary endpoints.
R	While screening rates were initially similar between models ( 43.2% and 34.8% for the ECMH and standard clinical panels , respectively , p = 0.32 ) , HIV screening rates increased from 43.2% to 95.0% in the ECMH compared with a significantly smaller increase from 35.0% to 50.0% in the standard clinical panel ( p < 0.0001 ).
R	Additionally , the ECMH resulted in statistically significantly increased screening rates for cervical cancer ( p < 0.001 ) and hepatitis C ( p < 0.0001 ).
C	This study demonstrates an association between a longitudinal ECMH clerkship and improved quality metrics at an SVFC.
C	Even measures not targeted for intervention , such as colorectal cancer and hepatitis C , showed significant improvement in screening rates when compared with the standard clinical model.
P	To determine whether a literature-based guideline , powered by educational meetings and individual feedback , improves manual hyperinflation ( MH ) performance by intensive care unit ( ICU ) nurses.
B	MH is frequently applied in intubated and mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
B	MH is a complex intervention , and large variation in its performance has been found.
M	First , a literature-based guideline on MH was developed.
M	The intervention consisted of education of this guideline and individual feedback.
M	Before and 3 months after the intervention , ICU nurses performed MH maneuvers in a skills laboratory.
M	Data collected included applied volumes , peak inspiratory flows ( PIF ) and peak expiratory flows ( PEF ) , and the use of inspiratory holds.
R	Eighty nurses participated.
R	Decrease of PIF was not statistically significant.
R	PEF increased from 52 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 23 L/min ( P < 0.01 ).
R	PIF to PEF ratio decreased from 1.4 [1.1-1.7] to 0.8 [0.6-1.1] ( P < 0.01 ).
R	Peak inspiratory pressures decreased from 40 +/- 14 to 19 +/- 6 cm H2O ( P < 0.01 ).
R	The proportion of nurses applying inspiratory holds increased from 14% to 58% ; use of rapid release of the resuscitation bag , considered mandatory , increased from 4% to 61%.
C	Implementation of a literature-based guideline on MH , powered by educational meetings and individual feedback , improves MH performance by ICU nurses.
C	If it is decided to practice MH in the care of the intubated and mechanical ventilated patient , a standardized , uniform performed MH procedure is a prerequisite.
B	There is still significant uncertainty as to whether market competition raises or lowers clinical quality in publicly funded healthcare systems.
B	We attempted to assess the effects of market competition on inpatient care quality of stroke patients in a retrospective study of the universal single-payer health insurance system in Taiwan.
M	In this 11-year population-based study , we conducted a pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis with a fixed-effects model and the Hausman test approach by utilizing two nationwide datasets: the National Health Insurance Research Database and the National Hospital and Services Survey in Taiwan.
M	Patients who were admitted to a hospital for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were enrolled.
M	After excluding patients with a previous history of stroke and those with different types of stroke , 247 379 ischemic and 79 741 hemorrhagic stroke patients were included in our analysis.
M	Four outcome indicators were applied: the in-hospital mortality rate , 30-day post-operative complication rate , 14-day re-admission rate and 30-day re-admission rate.
R	Market competition exerted a negative or negligible effect on the medical care quality of stroke patients.
R	Compared to hospitals located in a highly competitive market , in-hospital mortality rates for hemorrhagic stroke patients were significantly lower in moderately ( beta = -0.05 , P < 0.01 ) and less competitive markets ( beta = -0.05 , P < 0.01 ).
R	Conversely , the impact of market competition on the quality of care of ischemic stroke patients was insignificant.
C	Simply fostering market competition might not achieve the objective of improving the quality of health care.
C	Other health policy actions need to be contemplated.
B	The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation and interaction between the air pollution's components with cardiopulmonary endurance of elderly people in eight regions by using a multi-modal and correlation analysis.
M	The data of air pollution was collected in eight selected regions in 2013 to 2015.
M	At the same time , total number of 880 male and female , older than 65 year-olds , were investigated based on the cardiopulmonary endurance measurement in the same regions.
M	The correlation , interaction and multiple linear regressions was tested between the air pollution components in each region and cardiopulmonary endurance of elderly people , also between the air pollution components in each region and gender , respectively.
M	In this case , the regression analysis for both hypotheses was conducted.
R	There was a correlation between the level of air pollution and cardiopulmonary endurance , especially for the carbon monoxide which has a strong effect , it was followed by the effect of sulfur dioxide and fine dust , meanwhile nitrogen dioxide seems not to be effective for this measurement test.
R	Furthermore , it was highly unlikely that gender was a significant factor for the correlation between air pollution and cardiopulmonary endurance.
C	The importance and correlation between air pollution and cardiopulmonary capacity is a critical determinant for the public health of a society , while at the same time having a serious impact on certain age groups.
C	Provided that the factor of gender is highly unlikely to modify this impact , it is necessary to study the potential of other factors.
B	Nearly 3 million people in resource-poor countries receive antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV/AIDS , yet millions more require treatment.
B	Key barriers to treatment scale up are shortages of trained health care workers , and challenges integrating HIV/AIDS care with primary care.
B	The research: PALM PLUS ( Practical Approach to Lung Health and HIV/AIDS in Malawi ) is an intervention designed to simplify and integrate existing Malawian national guidelines into a single , simple , user-friendly guideline for mid-level health care workers.
B	Training utilizes a peer-to-peer educational outreach approach.
B	Research is being undertaken to evaluate this intervention to generate evidence that will guide future decision-making for consideration of roll out in Malawi.
B	The research consists of a cluster randomized trial in 30 public health centres in Zomba District that measures the effect of the intervention on staff satisfaction and retention , quality of patient care , and costs through quantitative , qualitative and health economics methods.
R	In the first phase of qualitative inquiry respondents from intervention sites demonstrated in-depth knowledge of PALM PLUS compared to those from control sites.
R	Participants in intervention sites felt that the PALM PLUS tool empowered them to provide better health services to patients.
R	Interim staff retention data shows that there were , on average , 3 to 4 staff departing from the control and intervention sites per month.
R	Additional qualitative , quantitative and economic analyses are planned.
R	The partnership: Dignitas International and the Knowledge Translation Unit at the University of Cape Town Lung Institute have led the adaptation and development of the PALM PLUS intervention , using experience gained through the implementation of the South African precursor , PALSA PLUS.
R	The Malawian partners , REACH Trust and the Research Unit at the Ministry of Health , have led the qualitative and economic evaluations.
R	Dignitas and Ministry of Health have facilitated interaction with implementers and policy-makers.
R	Challenges and successes: This initiative is an example of South-South knowledge translation between South Africa and Malawi , mediated by a Canadian academic-NGO hybrid.
R	Our success in developing and rolling out PALM PLUS in Malawi suggests that it is possible to adapt and implement this intervention for use in other resource-limited settings.
P	To investigate change across development in two smoking outcomes ( smoking status and rate ) , describe demographic differences in smoking , and longitudinally examine the effects of psychosocial variables on smoking ( psychological distress , victimization , and social support ) in lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) youth.
M	Participants were 248 ethnically diverse LGBT youth ( ages 16-20 years at baseline ) from a longitudinal cohort study with six waves over 3.5 years.
M	Baseline questionnaires included demographic variables and a measure of impulsivity , and longitudinal questionnaires included measures of cigarette smoking ( status and average number of cigarettes smoked daily ) , LGBT-based victimization , psychological distress , and perceived social support.
M	Analyses were conducted with hierarchical linear modeling.
R	Males had higher odds of smoking and smoking rate than females , but females' smoking rate increased more rapidly over time.
R	Psychological distress was associated with higher odds of smoking and smoking rate at the same wave , and it predicted smoking rate at the subsequent wave.
R	LGBT victimization was associated with higher odds of smoking at the same wave and predicted smoking rate at the subsequent wave.
R	Finally , significant other support predicted higher odds of smoking and smoking rate at the subsequent wave , but family support was negatively correlated with smoking rate at the same wave.
C	There are several viable avenues for the development of smoking prevention interventions for LGBT youth.
C	To optimize the efficacy of prevention strategies , we must consider experiences with victimization , the impact of psychological distress , and optimizing support from families and romantic partners.

B	Social support is an important factor to consider in understanding the grief process.
B	However , existing measures of social support fail to account adequately for the unique characteristics of grief experienced by healthcare workers in relation to the deaths of patients or nursing home residents.
P	The purposes of this study were to develop and to test a grief support measure specific to the experiences of healthcare workers.
M	Using a cross-sectional design , 380 nursing assistants completed self-administered surveys focusing on grief and loss in the nursing home setting.
M	Exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis were conducted to test the psychometric properties of the Grief Support in Healthcare Scale ( GSHCS ) and to investigate the scale's relationships with grief outcomes.
R	Reflective of the theory of disenfranchised grief , the 15 items of the GSHCS were loaded onto three distinct factors: recognition of the relationship , acknowledgement of the loss , and inclusion of the griever.
R	Reliability was acceptable to high across these factors ( Cronbach's alpha of .89 , .86 , and .78 , respectively ).
R	Regression analysis indicated that the three subscales of the GSHCS were related significantly to both distress from grief and growth from grief , yet these relationships were unique for each factor.
C	This research demonstrated that the GSHCS has acceptable reliability and face validity for understanding grief in healthcare workers and may aid in the development of interventions targeted at enfranchising grief in this population.
C	Additional testing is needed to estimate the validity and the reliability of the scale with other groups of healthcare workers.
B	Evidence of brain structural and functional alterations have been implicated in patients with somatization disorder ( SD ).
B	However , little is known about brain functional connectivity in SD.
B	In the present study , resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and graph theory were used to obtain a comprehensive view of whole-brain functional connectivity and to investigate the changes of voxel-wise functional networks in patients with SD.
M	Twenty-five first-episode , medication-naive patients with SD and 28 age- , sex- and education-matched healthy controls ( HCs ) underwent resting-state fMRI.
M	The graph theory approach was employed to analyze the data.
R	Compared to the HCs , patients with SD showed significantly increased functional connectivity strength in the right inferior temporal gyrus ( ITG ).
R	There is a significant positive correlation between the z-values of the cluster in the right ITG and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores.
C	Our findings indicate that there is a disruption of the functional connectivity pattern in the right ITG in first-episode , treatment-naive patients with SD , which bears clinical significance.
P	Greater acculturation is associated with higher rates of Substance use among Latino adolescents , but the reasons are poorly understood.
P	One potential explanation is that social networks chan.-e with acculturation , leading to decreased protection and increased risk.
P	Our objective was to identify Spanish language-sensitive individual and social network attributes associated with substance use in Latino adolescents.
M	Latino eighth-grade students in a Los Angeles public middle school completed a computerized.
M	self-administered survey about tobacco , alcohol , drug use.
M	and parental monitoring: and description of 30 social network members.
M	Regression analyses were used to estimate the independent associations of network-level Spanish language use and other factors With a substance use behavior scale.
M	Mediation analysis identified Spanish language-sensitive attributes.
R	Network-level Spanish language use was associated with a substance use scale in bivariate but not multivariate models.
R	Protective Spanish language-sensitive attributes included greater numbers of extended family members in the network , less substance use among network members.
R	and greater perceived Parental monitoring.
R	Risky Spanish language-insensitive attributes include more high school aged network members.
C	These results suggest that parental monitoring and some characteristics of social networks account for the relationship between Spanish language use and substance use among Latino adolescents.
C	Clinic- or community-based interventions that enhance protective characteristics of social networks in Latino adolescents may be effective.

B	The representation of low- and middle-income countries ( LMIC ) in traumatic stress research is important to establish a global evidence base , build research capacity , and reduce the burden of unmet mental health needs around the world.
B	Reviews of the traumatic stress literature up to 2002 showed trends toward globalization although LMIC were only marginally represented compared to high-income countries ( HIC ).
P	To examine the global nature of current traumatic stress research.
P	In particular , we were interested in the extent to which traumatic stress research is: ( 1 ) conducted in LMIC , ( 2 ) conducted by LMIC researchers , and ( 3 ) accessible to them.
M	Using the databases PubMed , PsychInfo , and PILOTS , we systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles on traumatic stress published in any language in the year 2012.
M	Out of the 3 ,123 unique papers identified , we coded a random sample ( N = 1 ,000 ) for study , author , article , and journal characteristics.
R	Although our sample involved research in 56 different countries , most papers ( 87% ) involved research in HIC , with 51% of all papers describing studies in the United States.
R	In 88% of the papers , the author team was affiliated with HIC only.
R	Less than 5% of all author teams involved collaborations between HIC and LMIC researchers.
R	Moreover , 45% of the articles on LMIC studies published by a HIC corresponding author did not involve any LMIC co-authors.
R	LMIC researchers appeared to publish empirical studies in lower impact journals.
R	Of the 1 ,000 articles in our sample , 32% were open access and 10% were made available via different means ; over half of the papers were not accessible without subscription.
C	Traumatic stress research is increasingly global but still strongly dominated by HIC.
C	Important opportunities to build capacity in LMIC appear to be missed.
C	Implications toward more international traumatic stress research are discussed.
B	No tool exists to measure self efficacy for overcoming lymphedema-related exercise barriers in individuals with cancer related lymphedema.
B	However , an existing scale measures confidence to overcome general exercise barriers in cancer survivors.
B	Therefore , the purpose of this study was to develop , validate and assess the reliability of a subscale , to be used in conjunction with the general barriers scale , for determining exercise barriers self efficacy in individuals facing lymphedema-related exercise barriers.
M	A lymphedema-specific exercise barriers self efficacy subscale was developed and validated using a cohort of 106 cancer survivors with cancer related lymphedema , from Brisbane , Australia.
M	An initial ten item lymphedema-specific barrier subscale was developed and tested , with participant feedback and principal components analysis results used to guide development of the final version.
M	Validity and test retest reliability analyses were conducted on the final subscale.
R	The final lymphedema-specific subscale contained five items.
R	Principal components analysis revealed these items loaded highly ( >0.75 ) on a separate factor when tested with a well established nine tern general barriers scale.
R	The final five item subscale demonstrated good construct and criterion validity , high internal consistency ( Cronbach's alpha = 0.93 ) and test retest reliability ( ICC = 0.67 , p <0.01 ).
C	A valid and reliable lymphedema-specific subscale has been developed to assess exercise barriers self efficacy in individuals with cancer related lymphedema.
C	This scale can be used in conjunction with an existing general exercise barriers scale to enhance exercise adherence in this understudied patient group.
B	Increasing concern about adolescent mental health problems has resulted in schools being identified as central sites for their prevention ( PsycInfo ; ERIC 2000-2012 ).
B	In this context , SEAL for secondary schools was launched in 2007.
M	The implementation strand of the national evaluation of secondary SEAL comprised longitudinal case studies of nine schools and used multiple methods and data sources , including interviews , observations and document review.
R	Implementation was variable , both within and between schools ; barriers were identified at programme , teacher and school levels.
C	Implementation issues identified have implications for SEAL and school-based mental health prevention and promotion interventions more generally.
B	Major depression ( MD ) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor , but the exact mechanisms are not clear.
B	In this study we have investigated the intraplatelet L-arginine-nitric oxide ( NO ) pathway and platelet function in depressive patients.
M	Nineteen unmedicated patients with MD ( 34 +/- 4 years ) and 19 control subjects ( CS , 34 +/- 3 years ) were included.
M	L-[H-3]-arginine influx , NO synthase ( NOS ) activity and intracellular cGMP levels were evaluated in platelets , as well as the expression of eNOS , iNOS , arginase and soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) , platelet aggregation and the systemic amino acid profile in MD patients and CS.
R	L-arginine influx ( pmol/10( 9 )cells/min ) in platelets was reduced from 46.2 +/- 9.5 to 20.02 +/- 2.12 in depression.
R	NOS activity ( pmol/10( 8 ) cells ) was diminished in MD patients ( 0.09 +/- 0.01 ) compared to CS ( 0.17 +/- 0.01 ).
R	Intracellular cGMP levels were also impaired in MD patients associated with hyperaggregability.
R	Moreover , the concentration of plasma L-arginine was reduced by 20% in MD patients.
R	The expression of eNOS , iNOS , arginase II and sGC in platelet lysates was not affected by MD.
C	Small number of patients in the study.
C	This study has demonstrated an impairment of L-arginine-NO signaling in platelets from MD patients , suggesting a role in platelet activation and cardiovascular events.

P	Investigate breeding sites with host snails and autochthonous human cases of schistosomiasis.
M	Between July 2010 and September 2012 were performed: ( 1 ) malacological survey searching for breeding sites , collection and identification of Biomphalaria snails positive for Schistosoma mansoni in Recife , PE , Northeastern Brazil ; ( 2 ) prevalence survey in 2 ,718 schoolchildren aged from seven to 14 years old to identify cases of schistosomiasis , clinical examination and ultrasound in positive cases of S. mansoni.
M	The autochthony of the cases was investigated and all of them were clinically evaluated.
M	The cases and breeding sites were georeferenced and spatially described.
R	The results identified 30 breeding with B. straminea , four of which were potential foci of transmission , as molecular testing identified snails with S. mansoni DNA.
R	There were 14 children diagnosed with schistosomiasis , of which five were considered to be autochthonous cases of the disease.
C	Urgent measures are required in order to avoid schistosomiasis becoming endemic to Recife , as has happened in other coastal areas of the state of Pernambuco.
B	In 2007 the European Commission issued the White Paper: "Together for Health".
B	Considered the EU Health Strategy for the years 2008-2013 , it offers the cornerstones for setting priorities in EU health actions.
P	The public health framework offered in this strategy is explicitly built on shared values including the overarching values of universality , access to good quality care , equity and solidarity that reacted to certain health care challenges within the EU.
P	This article analyses the Health Strategy via its ethical scope and considers implications for future health policy making.
M	The Health Strategy and related documents are scrutinised to explore how the mentioned values are defined and enfolded.
M	Additionally , scientific databases are searched for critical discussions of the value base of the Health Strategy.
M	The results are discussed and reasoned from a public health ethical perspective.
R	The Health Strategy is barely documented and discussed in the scientific literature.
R	Furthermore , no attention was given to the value base of the Health Strategy.
R	Our analysis shows that the mentioned values are particularly focussed on health care in general rather than on public health in particular.
R	Besides this , the given values of the Health Strategy are redundant.
C	An additional consideration of consequentialist public health ethics values would normatively strengthen a population-based health approach of EU health policy making.
B	In Cameroon , the effects of using acting as therapy for personal and social development are rarely documented by empirical studies.
B	Investigation for this research shows the absence of theatre activities in the hospital milieu destined to ensure a therapeutic follow-up of mental health patients.
M	Based on this realisation , this study focuses on theatre activities and their therapeutic potentials on these patients.
M	It presents a case study on the utilisation of acting with six patients from a mental health clinic in Yaounde , Cameroon.
M	It seeks to elaborate the use of the theatre medium for rehabilitation , particularly on cases of mental health.
M	A qualitative methodology is concretised by a therapeutic theatre workshop and a description of various theatre activities carried out as well as their effects on participants.
R	Based on the analyses , the results indicate that personal and social change can be facilitated in some mental health patients through the medium of therapeutic theatre.
C	By engaging in this collective production , the participants attained deeper understanding of their psychological states and developed coping mechanisms and re-adaptation of skills vis-a-vis depression , anxiety and stress.
P	We examine the extent to which components of social learning theory ( i.e. , definitions , differential reinforcement , and differential association/modeling ) predict stalking victimization and perpetration using survey data from a large sample of college students.
M	Among a sample of 2 ,766 college students , logistic regression models were estimated to analyze the relationships between social learning theory and stalking perpetration and victimization.
R	Results suggest that victimization and perpetration are functions of social learning.
R	The findings also indicated that females were significantly more likely to be both stalking victims and perpetrators.
C	Regarding stalking perpetration and victimization , our results suggest that there may be responses , attitudes , and behaviors that are learned , modified , or reinforced primarily through interaction with peers.
C	Overall , social learning theory concepts appear to be important predictors of stalking perpetration and victimization that help to develop theoretical explanations for stalking.

B	A considerable number of patients receive chelation therapy to treat their coronary artery disease.
B	However , there is no current empirical evidence to support its use.
P	To better understand patient's decision-making processes regarding the use of chelation therapy as a treatment for coronary artery disease.
M	Based on qualitative interviews with 32 coronary artery disease patients , a taxonomy of decision-related issues , hierarchical decision-model , and survey based on the model were developed.
M	The model was then pilot tested with another group of 30 patients and revised accordingly.
M	The final model was tested with another group of 167 patients ( 27 current users , 72 previous users , and 68 never users of chelation therapy ).
M	The primary examination of the model was to determine the degree to which it successfully identified people who fell within each behavioral group.
M	This was done by dividing the total number of successes by the total number of cases on all paths ( or questions in the questionnaire ).
R	The most important elements in the decision to use or not use chelation therapy were: previous experience with or learning about chelation therapy , openness to alternative treatments , satisfaction with current level of ( traditional ) care , physician opinion regarding chelation therapy , costs associated with chelation therapy , perceived access to chelation therapy provider , current state of health ( good or bad ) , and wanting to do 'all one can' for heart health.
R	When tested , the ability of the model to predict the appropriate outcome was nearly 93%.
R	The most salient junctures in the model that led participants to different behavioral outcomes were: considering using non-traditional treatments ; perceptions regarding potential risks and benefits ; cost ; and believing that using chelation therapy was 'doing all that they can' to help their heart health.
C	Descriptive decision-modeling is a useful method to depict cardiac patients' decision-making concerning the use of chelation therapy.
C	It can also assist healthcare providers and policy makers in directing interventions and policy aimed at enhancing the use of evidence-based therapies for cardiac patients.

B	The Islamic Republic of Iran is at high risk of natural disasters.
B	Households are the basic unit of society and they need to be prepared for disasters.
P	This study assessed disaster preparedness among Iranian households in 2015.
M	Using multistage cluster sampling , 2968 households in the catchment area of 53 public health departments in all 30 provinces of the Islamic Republic of Iran were surveyed on the disaster preparedness measures they had taken in the past year.
M	The data collection questionnaire included 15 disaster preparedness measures.
M	The mean preparedness score was calculated and its association with residence ( urban versus rural ) , house ownership ( owner versus renter ) and education level of the head of the household ( illiterate , elementary school , middle school , high school , university ) was evaluated.
R	The mean score for household disaster preparedness was 9.3 out of 100 ( 95% confidence interval: 8.3-10.3 ).
R	Multivariate analysis showed higher preparedness among rural than urban households ( P = 0.02 ).
R	Higher education level was positively associated with a higher preparedness score ( P < 0.001 ) , as was house ownership ( P < 0.001 ).
C	The level of household disaster preparedness in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2015 was low.
C	In line with the first priority for action of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction , the current study provides an overall picture of household disaster preparedness in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
C	This estimation can be used as a baseline value for policy-making , planning , and evaluation of public awareness of disasters in the country.
B	The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument ( LLFDI ) provides a comprehensive , reliable , and valid assessment of physical function and disability in community-dwelling adults.
B	There does not appear to be a validated , comprehensive instrument for assessing function and disability in Arabic.
B	The objective of the present study was to translate and culturally adapt the LLFDI to Arabic , and to determine its test-retest reliability and validity.
M	The LLFDI was translated to Arabic through a forward and backward translation process , and approved by a bilingual committee of experts.
M	Sixty-one ( 26 male and 35 female ) Arabic speaking , healthy , older adults , ages 65-88 , living in northern Israel participated in the study.
M	To determine test-retest reliability , the questionnaire was administered twice to 41 subjects with a 6 to 8day interval.
M	Construct validity was examined by correlating the LLFDI responses with the 10-item physical function ( PF-10 ) subscales of the General Health Survey ( SF-36 ) , with the physical component of SF-36 ( SF-36 PCS ) , and with two performance measures , the Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) and Time Up and Go ( TUG ) test.
M	Additionally , gender and fall related differences in the LLFDI were also examined.
R	Internal consistency ( Cronbach's alpha ) was good to excellent ( 0.77 to 0.97 ).
R	Test-retest agreement was good to very good ( function component: 0.86-0.93 , disability component: 0.77-0.93 ).
R	Correlation with the SF-36 PCS and PF-10 was moderate to strong for both LLFDI components ( function , r = 0.53-0.65 and r = 0.57-0.63 , and LLFDI disability , r = 0.57-0.76 and 0.53-0.73 , respectively ).
R	Significant , moderate-to-strong correlations between the LLFDI and BBS ( r = 0.73-0.87 ) and a significant , moderate , negative correlation between LLFDI and TUG test ( r = -0.59--0.68 ) were noted.
R	The standard error of measure was 6-12% , and the smallest real difference was 18-33%.
R	Discriminative validity for both gender and fall status were also demonstrated.
C	The Arabic version of the LLFDI is a highly reliable and valid instrument for assessing function and disability in community dwelling , Arab older adults.
C	The translated instrument has a discriminative ability between genders and between fallers and non-fallers.
C	The translated instrument may be used in clinical settings and for research purposes.
P	To investigate the effect of whole-body tilt exercise for treating hemispatial neglect and to identify the effects of incorporating mental practice into the exercise.
M	We used a single-subject experimental design alternating with multiple baselines.
M	Three stroke patients with hemispatial neglect participated in this study.
M	The severity of hemispatial neglect and balance function were measured during baseline and intervention sessions.
M	The whole-body tilt exercise was performed by using a device that allows the body to tilt 20 degrees.
M	from the neutral upright position.
M	Mental practice consisted of 5 min of relaxation , main whole-body tilt imagination , and normalization phases.
R	When the whole-body tilt exercise alone was performed , the average severity score of hemispatial neglect in subjects 1 , 2 , and 3 decreased by 7.54 , 10.02 , and 8.24 , respectively ; their respective average balance function score increased by 35.95% , 28.13% , and 15.33% under the open-eye condition and 34.66% , 20.33% , and 13.77% under the closed-eye condition.
R	For subjects 1 , 2 , and 3 , the respective average hemispatial neglect score decreased by 9.07 , 11.35 , and 10.13 after the whole-body tilt exercise with mental practice ; their average balance function scores increased by 40.15% , 33.38% , and 24.22% under the open-eye condition and by 38.93% , 27.08% , and 11.88% under the closed-eye condition , respectively.
C	These findings suggest that a whole-body tilt exercise alone may be beneficial in enhancing hemispatial neglect symptoms but the addition of mental practice produces a greater positive effect.
B	Many cancers arise from sites of infection and inflammation.
B	Results from animal studies indicate that inflammatory cells may facilitate neoplastic processes by orchestrating the tumor microenvironment.
B	Little is known about the role of inflammation in the etiology of breast cancer.
B	The aim of this study was to examine possible associations between a history of mastitis requiring hospitalization and subsequent risk of breast cancer.
M	This cohort study of 2 ,577 ,565 women used data from several Swedish population-based registers , including the Inpatient Register and the Cancer Register.
M	The risk of breast cancer was assessed by Poisson regression modeling.
R	We identified 8411 women in the Inpatient Register with a discharge diagnosis of mastitis.
R	Of these , 106 had a subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer recorded in the Cancer Register.
R	Compared with women who had no recorded mastitis , the incidence rate of breast cancer ( regardless of laterality ) was higher in women with mastitis , with an incidence rate ratio of 1.23 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.49 ) following adjustment for age , calendar time , age at first birth and parity.
R	In the group of women among whom information on laterality was available for both the mastitis and the malignancy ( n = 87 ) , side of lesions corresponded for 52% ( 95% CI = 41%-62% ) , which is what could be expected by chance.
C	The overall risk of breast cancer was slightly elevated in women with a history of mastitis recorded in the Inpatient Register.
C	The absence of a correlation between laterality of lesions , however , does not support a causal association between inflammation and the development of breast cancer.
B	Craving is a major issue in drug addiction , and a target for drug treatment.
B	The Marijuana Craving Questionnaire-Short Form ( MCQ-SF ) is a useful tool for assessing cannabis craving in clinical and research settings.
P	To validate the French version of the MCQ-SF ( FMCQ-SF ).
M	Young adult cannabis users not seeking treatment ( n = 679 ) completed the FMCQ-SF and questionnaires assessing their frequency of cannabis use and craving , cannabis use disorder criteria , and alcohol use.
R	Confirmatory factor analysis of the four-factor FMCQ-SF model did not fit the data well.
R	Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution ( "pleasure" , characterized by planning and expectation of positive effects , and "release of tension" , characterized by relief from anxiety , nervousness , or tension ) with good psychometric properties.
R	This two-factor model showed good internal and convergent validity and correlated with cannabis abuse and dependence and with frequency of cannabis use and craving.
C	Validation of the FMCQ-SF generated a two-factor model , different from the four-factor solution generated in English language studies.
C	Considering that craving plays an important role in withdrawal and relapse , this questionnaire should be useful for French-language addiction professionals.
B	Psychiatric disorders during the reproductive years and their treatment with psychotropic medications are increasingly common , and their effect on the reproductive system is an important area of research.
P	To review the effect of mental illness and psychotropic medication on gametes and fertility.
M	Searches of the PubMed database were conducted for English-language articles containing the keywords gametes , fertility , psychotropic , oocyte , sperm , mental illness , depression , and/or anxiety , in the title or abstract.
M	The searches yielded 3 ,603 citations.
M	Studies were evaluated for relevance.
M	Those not pertinent to the clinical question , not written in English , and focusing on invertebrates were excluded.
M	Full texts of 50 articles were obtained for further evaluation.
M	Additional articles were identified from reference lists.
M	Ultimately , a total of 37 studies were deemed suitable and reviewed.
R	Clinical studies have not demonstrated a deleterious effect of psychotropic medication on oocytes in terms of retrieval and pregnancy rates.
R	Clinical studies demonstrate inconclusive results regarding the effect on sperm , with several studies suggesting increased sperm motility and quantity with certain psychotropics.
R	Decreased sperm quantity and motility are described in a number of studies , including in vitro and in vivo studies.
R	Maternal psychiatric illness is associated with decreased reproductive success , including lower rates of oocyte retrieval , lower rates of ongoing pregnancy , and dysregulation of the stress system in a majority ( n = 11 ) but not all ( n = 3 ) studies reviewed.
R	Male depression did not appear to affect sperm , but anxiety did have an effect ( n = 1 ).
C	Given the detrimental effect of untreated mental illness , current literature is not robust enough to influence the use of psychotropics in males or females who are considering reproduction.
B	Junior doctors undertake a significant amount of prescribing ; however , they are not well prepared for this , and report they would like more training in their undergraduate courses.
B	To address this we tested a pharmacist-led prescribing program for final-year medical students.
M	Sixteen final-year students took part in the program.
M	The program involved students writing prescriptions and getting feedback from clinical pharmacists , undertaking prescribing and calculation tutorials , and spending time in the pharmacy department.
M	Evaluation included a pre- and post-assessment of their confidence and skills in prescribing , and a feedback session discussing the strengths and weakness of the program , and their perceptions about the role of pharmacists.
M	Changes in the pre- and post-assessment of confidence and skills were examined with permutation and Mann-Whitney U tests.
R	There was a significant improvement in students' confidence in prescribing , and a small but consistent improvement in prescribing skills.
R	Of note , no student prescribed inappropriately and potentially harmfully after the program.
R	Participants were positive about the program , and indicated a better understanding about the pharmacists' role and their ability to support them as junior doctors.
C	This study has shown the potential effect of a pharmacist-led prescribing program on the skills and confidence in prescribing by medical students.
C	It provided an interprofessional teaching opportunity , preparing students for a team-based approach to patient management.
B	Current food safety issues are deleteriously reshaping the lifestyle of the population in the developing world.
B	The globalization of food supply impacts patterns of foodborne disease outbreaks worldwide , and consumers are having increased concern about microbiological food safety.
M	A total of 2305 samples including sauced meat , sausage , smoked meat , shrimp , sashimi and shellfish were collected from different farmer's markets and supermarkets.
M	The prevalence of selected foodborne pathogens was evaluated in cooked meat and seafood from 2010 to 2013 in Shandong Province , China.
R	The average contamination rate was 6.39% ( 93.1456 ) for the selected pathogens in cooked meat and 16.84% ( 143.849 ) for V. parahaemolyticus in seafood.
R	For the selected pathogens , 0.55% , 1.03% , 1.17% , 3.64% and 16.84% samples were contaminated with E. coli O157: H7 , Salmonella spp. , L. monocytogenes , S. aureus and VP , respectively.
R	There was a significant ( P< 0.05 ) difference in the contamination rate between the farmer's markets and supermarkets.
C	The contamination was decreasing in cooked meat and maintaining a relatively high level in seafood from 2010 to 2013.
C	E. coli O157: H7 , S. aureus , L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. existed at a relatively low rate in retail foods.
C	For VP , the contamination rate has been maintained at a relatively high level in Shandong Province in China.
C	Moreover , cooked meat and seafood obtained from farmer's markets are more susceptible to be contaminated compared to those from supermarkets.
B	Developments in data collection technology enable evaluation of kinematic characteristics of the drawing process.
B	We examined the clock drawing task in elderly patients with mild Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , assessed the relative importance of kinematic measures that differentiate the groups and analyzed associations between computerized measures , and the cognitive and depression status of the study groups.
M	The participants comprised 20 elderly people with mild MDD and 20 matched controls.
M	Both groups performed a clock drawing task using a computerized system.
M	Kinematic measures included: number of segments drawn , performance time , pressure implemented towards the drawing surface , and pen azimuth.
M	Three representative spatial characteristics were analyzed per segments drawn on the paper: height , width and length.
M	The clock drawing tasks were blindly scored with Freedman's method.
M	Cognitive state was quantified using the Mini-mental State Examination ( MMSE ) and depression with the Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ).
R	Freedman's method found no between-group differences.
R	Pressure and azimuth measures and spatial measures of segments height , width and length were significantly lower in the mild MDD group , while the number of paper segments and performance time did not differ.
R	The azimuth measure correlated with the GDS score , and pressure with the MMSE and the GDS scores.
R	Spatial measures did not correlate with either the MMSE or GDS.
R	Pressure , segment width and length , azimuth and segment height allowed correct classification of 81.1% of the participants.
C	A computerized system focusing on the clock drawing task might be sensitive to altered performance among elderly people with mild MDD.
B	Parent training ( PT ) is identified as the most effective intervention for the treatment of conduct disorder ( CD ).
B	Intervention observational outcomes are often reported as summarised composite scores , providing an overview of overall construct change.
B	Methods and aims: Parents of children aged 3-5 years identified 'at risk' of developing CD were randomly allocated to either PT intervention or waiting list control group.
B	Parent and child behaviours were assessed before and after the intervention period.
B	The current paper aims to establish which individual observed parenting categories change as a result of PT , and which specific observed leader categories predict these changes.
R	Controlling for baseline scores , ANCOVA demonstrated changes in parent praise and reflective behaviours as significant post-intervention.
R	One-way ANOVAs demonstrated higher levels of leader praise and reflective behaviours resulted in greater change in parental praise and reflective behaviours respectively.
R	Regression analyses indicated these leader behaviours predict positive change in parental praise and reflective behaviours for intervention families.
C	Composite observational scores provide an account of behaviour constructs , whereas individual behaviour categories provide an insight into the core components of these constructs.
C	The results suggest praise and reflection as key leader behaviours that influence the mechanisms of change in parenting behaviours as a result of PT.

B	This paper investigates the relationship between care staff perceptions' of self-harm behaviours presented by adult and adolescent inpatients and the emotional responses and helping behaviours of the staff.
M	Seventy-six nursing staff participated , including qualified and unqualified staff , who worked in either adolescent or adult secure inpatient settings within a single organization.
M	Participants completed vignette , knowledge , and attitudes questionnaires , related to working with patients who display deliberate self-harm.
R	Further support was found for attributional theories suggesting that views on deliberate self-harm are linked to propensity to help , and that emotional responses can be a mediating factor.
R	Staff who reported feeling more negative about patients who self-harm reported more worry about working with this patient group.
R	Unqualified nursing staff reported more negativity and worry than qualified staff.
R	Neither gender nor length of work experience was found to be significant factors.
C	These findings indicate that training and support should be aimed at helping nursing staff , particularly unqualified staff working in inpatient settings 66 where self-harm is frequent , feet more positive and less concerned about working with patients who self-harm.
C	Such needs of unqualified nursing staff have not been highlighted in previous research.
B	Previous studies have shown that hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive impairment , but whether this association is also present in extremely poor populations in Low Middle Income Countries settings remains to be studied.
B	Understanding other drivers of cognitive impairment in this unique population also merits attention.
M	We performed a secondary analysis using data from the "Encuesta de Salud y Bienestar del Adulto Mayor" , a regional survey conducted in an extremely poor population of people older than 65 years old from 12 Peruvian cities in 2012.
M	The outcome variable was cognitive impairment , determined by a score of <= 7 in the modified Mini-Mental State Examination.
M	The exposure was self-reported hypertension status.
M	Variables such as age , gender , controlled hypertension , education level , occupation , depression and area of living ( rural/urban ) were included in the adjusted analysis.
M	We used Poisson regression with robust variance to calculate prevalence ratios ( PR ) and 95% confidence interval ( 95% CI ) adjusting for confounders.
R	Data from 3842 participants was analyzed , 51.8% were older than 70 years , and 45.6% were females.
R	The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 1.7% ( 95% CI 1.3%-2.1% ).
R	There was no significant difference on the prevalence of cognitive impairment between the group of individuals with hypertension in comparison with those without hypertension ( PR = 0.64 , 95% CI 0.33-1.23 ).
C	The association described between hypertension and cognitive impairment was not found in a sample of extremely poor Peruvian older adults.
B	Although the escalation of cocaine consumption is a hallmark of cocaine dependence , the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this change in behavior are not well understood.
M	This study used an extended access version of the drug self-administration procedure to explore how N-methyl-n-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors are involved in escalation of cocaine consumption.
M	Male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 59 ) were first trained to self-administer cocaine ( 0.33 mg/infusion , i.v. ) under a fixed-ratio 1 ( FR1 ) schedule of reinforcement.
M	After training , rats were implanted with subcutaneous osmotic minipumps filled with vehicle or the non-competitive NMDAR antagonist , dizocilpine ( 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg/d ) , and subsequently allowed to self-administer cocaine in 2 h or 6 h self-administration sessions.
R	In the 6 h groups , vehicle-treated rats escalated cocaine self-administration across 15 self-administration sessions ; rats treated with dizocilpine escalated cocaine self-administration at a greater rate and to a greater degree.
R	Rats that self-administered cocaine during 2 h sessions did not escalate consumption of cocaine under any treatment condition.
R	Discontinuation of dizocilpine treatment in the 6 h access condition led to a substantial decrease in cocaine consumption , down to pre-escalation levels , and then control rates of escalation thereafter.
R	Despite large differences in intake under the FR1 schedule , post-escalation break point under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement did not differ between groups.
C	These data suggest that glutamate tone through NMDA receptors can play a dynamic role in regulating cocaine intake and escalation of consumption.

B	Alcohol use disorders ( AUD ) is a phase of alcohol misuse in which the drinker consumes excessive amount of alcohol and have a continuous urge to consume alcohol which may lead to various health complications.
B	The current methods of alcohol use disorders diagnosis such as questionnaires and some biomarkers lack specificity and sensitivity.
B	Metabolomics is a novel scientific field which may provide a novel method for the diagnosis of AUD by using a sensitive and specific technique such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ).
M	A cross sectional study was conducted on three groups: individuals with alcohol use disorders ( n = 30 ) , social drinkers ( n = 54 ) and alcohol-naive controls ( n = 60 ).
M	H-1 NMR-based metabolomics was used to obtain the metabolic profiles of plasma samples.
M	Data were processed by multivariate principal component analysis ( PCA ) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA ) followed by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to produce the best fit-model for discrimination between groups.
R	The OPLS-DA model was able to distinguish between the AUD group and the other groups with high sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of 64.29% , 98.17% and 91.24% respectively.
R	The logistic regression model identified two biomarkers in plasma ( propionic acid and acetic acid ) as being significantly associated with alcohol use disorders.
R	The reproducibility of all biomarkers was excellent ( 0.81-1.0 ).
C	The applied plasma metabolomics technique was able to differentiate the metabolites between AUD and the other groups.
C	These metabolites are potential novel biomarkers for diagnosis of alcohol use disorders.

B	Every curriculum needs to be reviewed , implemented and evaluated ; it must also comply with the regulatory standards.
B	This report demonstrates the value of curriculum mapping ( CM ) , which shows the spatial relationships of a curriculum , in developing and managing an integrated medical curriculum.
M	A new medical school developed a clinical presentation driven integrated curriculum that incorporates the active-learning pedagogical practices of many educational institutions worldwide while adhering to the mandated requirements of the accreditation bodies.
M	A centralized CM process was run in parallel as the curriculum was being developed.
M	A searchable database , created after the CM data was uploaded into an electronic curriculum management system , was used to ensure placing , integrating , evaluating and revising the curricular content appropriately.
R	CM facilitated in a ) appraising the content integration , b ) identifying gaps and redundancies , c ) linking learning outcomes across all educational levels ( i.e. session to course to program ) , c ) organizing the teaching schedules , instruction methods , and assessment tools and d ) documenting compliance with accreditation standards.
C	CM is an essential tool to develop , review , improve and refine any integrated curriculum however complex.
C	Our experience , with appropriate modifications , should help other medical schools efficiently manage their curricula and fulfill the accreditation requirements at the same time.
B	Socio-cultural factors , including media and family , play an important role in introducing and reinforcing pro-smoking intentions.
B	Tendencies to appraise smokers in media in positive , negative , and empathic ways may play a role in the social and familial dynamics influencing smoking intentions.
P	This study assessed: ( 1 ) social group differences in appraisals of pro-and antismoking imagery in media ; ( 2 ) whether parental antismoking expectations are associated with less positive appraisals ; and ( 3 ) whether these appraisal tendencies mediate the relationship between parental antismoking expectations and smoking intentions.
M	Adolescents ( N = 515 , ages 11-13 , M = 11.5 years ) from Auckland , New Zealand completed a multimedia , computer-based questionnaire assessing media exposure of smoking imagery in four media clips as well as media exposure , parental attitudes toward smoking , and smoking intentions.
R	Appraisals of smoking imagery in the media clips and media consumption were patterned on the basis of gender , ethnic group , school economic status , and peer and parent smoking behaviors.
R	Positive appraisals of the smoking images were found to mediate the relationship between weaker parental antismoking expectations and greater smoking intentions.
C	Parents may have significant influence over how adolescents perceive smoking imagery in media by presenting clear and unambiguous expectations about tobacco use at home.
C	These expectations may shape how adolescents respond to smoking images by effectively "tainting" the image.

P	Individuals with aphasia often report that they feel able to say words in their heads , regardless of speech output ability.
P	Here , we examine whether these subjective reports of successful "inner speech" ( IS ) are meaningful and test the hypothesis that they reflect lexical retrieval.
M	Participants were 53 individuals with chronic aphasia.
M	During silent picture naming , participants reported whether or not they could say the name of each item inside their heads.
M	Using the same items , they also completed 3 picture-based tasks that required phonological retrieval and 3 matched auditory tasks that did not.
M	We compared participants' performance on these tasks for items they reported being able to say internally versus those they reported being unable to say internally.
M	Then , we examined the relationship of psycholinguistic word features to self-reported IS and spoken naming accuracy.
R	Twenty-six participants reported successful IS on nearly all items , so they could not be included in the item-level analyses.
R	These individuals performed correspondingly better than the remaining participants on tasks requiring phonological retrieval , but not on most other language measures.
R	In the remaining group ( n = 27 ) , IS reports related item-wise to performance on tasks requiring phonological retrieval , but not to matched control tasks.
R	Additionally , IS reports were related to 3 word characteristics associated with lexical retrieval , but not to articulatory complexity ; spoken naming accuracy related to all 4 word characteristics.
R	Six participants demonstrated evidence of unreliable IS reporting ; compared with the group , they also detected fewer errors in their spoken responses and showed more severe language impairments overall.
C	Self-reported IS is meaningful in many individuals with aphasia and reflects lexical phonological retrieval.
C	These findings have potential implications for treatment planning in aphasia and for our understanding of IS in the general population.
B	Text2Quit , an interactive text-messaging program , aimed at smoking cessation , has been shown to increase quit rates , but engagement has not been thoroughly explored.
B	Understanding :the program features associated with engagement and behavior change is integral: for effective program design.
P	This study explored participants' interaction with the Text2Quit text-messaging program and associations between engagement and smoking.
P	cessation.
M	The study included the 262 participants who received the Text2Quit intervention.
M	Self-reported engagement measures ; primarily usage of Text2Quit keywords and survey responses , were collected through computer records of ,participant use ; Demographic variables and self-reported smoking , abstinence were recorded in surveys at baseline and 6-Month assessment.
R	The majority of participants ( 73% ) maintained their subscription during the 6-month intervention: On average , participants received 210.51 text messages , 23.75 emails , and logged into the web portal.
R	.
R	1.94 times Being female was predictive of engagement with the program ( beta = 15.39 ).
R	Program engagement , measured by the keyword PLEDGE ( p = .002 ) and the smokefree Status at 7 Days survey ( p < .001 ):Were associated with 6-Month abstinence ; use of keywords SMOKED ( p :001 ) , RELAPSE ( p = .007 ) , and STOP ( p = .023 ) were inversely related to abstinence.
R	While abstainers ( N = 83 , 31% ) Stayed enrolled.
R	longer and engaged with the program more frequently , program "dose" was not predictive of smoking cessation.
C	Using interactive tools such as Pledges:and reporting on smoking status were predictive of Cessation.
C	Further study of program features is required to understand how to optimally design text messaging programs.
B	Prior research endorsed the establishment of sexual assault centres in the Netherlands because of the potential benefit for victims' mental recovery.
B	In 2012 , the first Dutch sexual assault centre was founded at the University Medical Center Utrecht.
B	The aim of the centre is to provide 24/7 coordinated and integrated services ( i.e. , medical , forensic , and psychological ) in one location.
P	The purpose of the present study was to describe demographic , background , and assault characteristics of victims seen at the centre within one week post-assault , and their use of post-assault services in order to improve current services.
M	From January 2012 to September 2013 , prospective data of 108 patients were collected.
M	To describe the population included , frequency counts and proportions were generated for categorical variables.
R	The mean age was 21.3 years ( SD = 9.8 ).
R	Most victims were female ( 91.7% ).
R	A large proportion of victims reported background characteristics known to increase the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and revictimisation such as prior sexual abuse ( 32.4% ) , pre-existing use of mental health services ( 45.4% ) , and not living with both biological parents ( 61.7% ).
R	Most patients ( 88.9% ) consulted the centre within 72 hours post-assault.
R	The uptake of services was high: 82.4% received emergency medical care , 61.7% underwent a forensic-medical exam , 34% reported to the police , and 82.4% utilised psychological services.
C	To prevent revictimisation and PTSD , current psychological services could be improved with immediate trauma-focused treatments.
C	Current forensic services may be improved with the use of standard top to toe forensic-medical examinations for both children and adults.
P	The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using the mHealth Family Adaptation Intervention ( FamilyAdapt-DS ) , with families of young children with Down syndrome ( DS ) , and to assess the effect of participating in this mHealth intervention on family adaptation.
M	A one-group pre-test post-test design was employed.
M	Sixteen parents from eight families of young children with DS ( under the age of three years ) participated in this study between September 2015 and September 2016.
M	A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to identify the difference between the pre-test and post-test scores.
R	All parents perceived that the program was feasible to use and they were willing to recommend the intervention to other families.
R	Improvements were noted between pre-test and post-test scores.
R	For fathers , views of their child's daily life became more positive , their child's condition became more manageable , their problem-solving communication became more affirming and their family functioning scores improved.
R	Mothers reported less difficulty managing their child's condition.
C	These findings suggest that FamilyAdapt-DS is a feasible m-Health intervention for families of young children with DS ; however , scaling up of this program with larger and more diverse samples is needed to test its effectiveness.
C	Nurses and other healthcare providers may find it helpful to use therapeutic conversations and mHealth interventions such as the one described in this paper to tailor the care they provide to families of young children with DS.

B	Radon , a naturally occurring radioactive gas , is a carcinogen that causes a small proportion of lung cancers among exposed populations.
B	Theoretical models suggest that radon may also be a risk factor for skin cancer , but epidemiologic evidence for this relationship is weak.
B	In this study , we investigated ecologic associations between environmental radon concentration and the incidence of various types of skin cancer.
M	We analyzed data for 287 small areas ( postcode sectors ) in southwest England for the years 2000-2004.
M	Poisson regression was used to compare registration rates of malignant melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma across mean indoor radon concentrations from household surveys.
M	Analyses were adjusted for potentially confounding factors , including age , sex , population socioeconomic status , and mean hours of bright sunshine.
R	No association was observed between mean postcode sector radon concentration and either malignant melanoma or basal cell carcinoma registration rates.
R	However , sectors with higher radon levels had higher squamous cell carcinoma registration rates , with evidence of an exposure-response relationship.
R	Comparing highest and lowest radon categories , postcode sectors with mean radon >= 230 Bq/m( 3 ) had registration rates 1.76 ( 95% confidence interval = 1.46-2.11 ) times those with mean radon 0-39 Bq/m( 3 ).
R	Associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders.
C	This ecologic study suggests that environmental radon exposure may be a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.
C	Further study is warranted to overcome ecologic design limitations and to determine whether this relationship is generalizable to national and international settings.
B	Unintentional overdose deaths due to nonmedical use of prescription drugs disproportionately impact rural over urban settings in the United States.
B	Sources of these prescriptions may play a factor.
P	This study examines the relationships between rurality and source of prescription drugs used nonmedically.
M	Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2008-2010 ( n = 10 693 ) , we examined bivariate and multivariate associations of socio-demographic and clinical correlates and source ( physician or non-physician ) of prescription drugs ( opioid , sedative , tranquilizer , or stimulant ) used nonmedically among urban and rural residents.
M	We also examined the type of prescription drugs used nonmedically among urban and rural residents by source.
R	Among respondents reporting past year nonmedical use of prescription medications , 18.9% of urban residents and 17.5% of rural residents had a physician source for drugs used nonmedically.
R	Likelihood of physician source for urban and rural residents was increased in Hispanic , insured individuals and those with any prescription drug dependence.
R	Rural residents who had a non-physician source were more likely than urban residents with a non-physician source to use hydrocodone ( 49% vs. 43.3% , p = 0.05 ) , morphine ( 17.7% vs. 14.0% , p = 0.04 ) , tramadol products ( 18.1% vs. 11.2% , p = 0.003 ) , and methadone ( 17.2% vs. 10.9% , p = 0.001 ).
C	Urban and rural individuals with nonmedical use of prescription drugs are equally likely to obtain these prescriptions from a physician source.
C	Some factors associated with obtaining prescription drugs from a physician source differed between these populations , which may have implications for public health approaches to addressing problems such as overdose.
B	While alcohol cessation improves mortality in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) , many patients struggle to achieve abstinence.
B	Our aim was to characterize ALD patients' preferences , misconceptions , and barriers to alcohol use treatment options.
M	This mixed-methods study included outpatients with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis recruited from a hepatology clinic for a survey or an in-depth semi-structured interview.
M	We purposefully sampled men and women , compensated and decompensated patients to ensure adequate representation of gender and severity of liver disease for the qualitative interviews.
R	123 patients completed surveys among which 50% reported having at least one drink within the past year while only 20 patients were in any form of current alcohol treatment.
R	Of the 23 patients reporting drinking within 3 months , only 3 were in AUD treatment currently.
R	17% had at least one misconception about alcohol use or treatment.
R	An additional 22 ALD patients ( 10 women , 12 men ) completed phone interviews of which two third self-reported alcohol abstinence.
R	All 22 interview participants had awareness of some form of alcohol treatment , but 13 felt that they did not need treatment with several characterizing it as ineffective or a "waste of time."
R	Misconceptions included inaccurate perceptions of relapse medication side effects , beliefs that the presence of advanced liver disease symptoms means it is too late to treat alcohol use , and a lack of understanding about the chronicity of alcohol use disorders.
R	The most common barriers to treatment included unwillingness to be in treatment , financial/insurance and transportation barriers.
C	Alcohol use treatment was underutilized in many ALD patients , despite active drinking in many.
C	Tailored education and preference sensitive treatment engagement may overcome barriers to alcohol use treatment and promote abstinence.
B	We compared women's acceptability of urine and cervico-vaginal sample self-collection for high-risk ( oncogenic ) human papillomavirus ( hrHPV ) testing and assessed whether acceptability varied across racial/ethnic groups.
M	As part of a test accuracy study of urine-based hrHPV testing , we recruited a convenience sample of women 25-65 years of age at two colposcopy clinics in North Carolina between November 2016 and January 2019.
M	After self-collection of urine and cervico-vaginal samples , women completed a questionnaire on the acceptability of the sample collection methods.
M	We coded open-ended questions inductively.
M	All results are presented stratified by racial/ethnic group.
R	We included 410 women ( 119 Hispanic , 115 non-Hispanic Black , 154 non-Hispanic White , and 22 women with other racial identities ).
R	Most women ( 79% , 95% confidence interval [CI] = 76%-83% ) had positive feelings about urine-based hrHPV testing.
R	Women generally preferred urine ( 78% , 95% CI = 74%-82% ) over cervico-vaginal self-collection ( 18% , 95% CI = 14%-22% ) , but the degree differed by racial/ethnic group , increasing from 75% in non-Hispanic Black to 82% in Hispanic women ( p = 0.011 ).
R	Most women reported at least one positive aspect of urine ( 89% ) and cervico-vaginal self-collection ( 85% ) for hrHPV testing with the most common positive aspect being easy sample collection , although 16% of women were concerned about performing the cervico-vaginal self-collection correctly.
C	Self-collection for hrHPV-based cervical cancer screening is highly acceptable to women across different racial/ethnic groups in the United States , and most women in our study would be more likely to attend future cervical cancer screening appointments if screening were urine based.
C	Urine-based hrHPV testing is a promising approach to improve cervical cancer screening coverage.
B	Inclement weather and home environment can act as barriers to physical activity.
B	However , it is unclear if they reduce the activity of persons participating in activity-promoting programs.
M	Data from a 6-monthworkplace financial incentives program were used to establish the association between meteorologic ( temperature , rain , snow , and wind ) and geographic factors ( urban/nonurban home location and distance between home and work ) and moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ).
M	Multivariable models were built to estimate mean weekly minutes of MVPA adjusting for demographic factors , clinical factors , and impulsivity.
R	The 292 participants had a mean age of 38 ( SD = 11 ) years.
R	Eighty-three percent were female and 62% were white.
R	Twentynine percent lived within 3 miles of work , and 35% lived in urban areas.
R	Participants who lived more than 3 miles from work averaged 75 [95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 65-84] minutes of weekly MVPA compared with 105 ( 95% CI , 88-122 ) minutes for those who lived within 3 miles of work.
R	Urban participants averaged 70 ( 95% CI , 57-83 ) minutes of MVPA compared with 91 ( 95% CI , 80-102 ) minutes for nonurban participants.
R	Colder temperatures were associated with decreased MVPA , and impulsivity modified the effect.
C	Colder temperatures , greater distance from work , and an urban residence are associated with fewer minutes of MVPA.
B	Antipsychotics are frequently used to treat psychosis , aggression and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) , but safety warnings abound.
B	Escitalopram was investigated since citalopram has demonstrated some effectiveness in AD.
B	We compared escitalopram and risperidone for psychotic symptoms and agitation associated with AD.
M	Inpatients with AD , who had been hospitalized because of behavioral symptoms , were recruited to a six-week randomized , double-blind , controlled trial.
M	Participants ( n = 40 ) were randomized to once daily risperidone 1 mg or escitalopram 10 mg.
R	The NPI total score improved in both groups.
R	Onset was earlier in the risperidone-treated group , but improvement did not significantly differ between groups by study end.
R	Completion rates differed for escitalopram ( 75% ) and risperidone ( 55% ) , mainly due to adverse events.
R	There were no adverse events in the escitalopram group , while in the risperidone group two patients suffered severe extrapyramidal symptoms and four patients suffered acute physical illness necessitating transfer to general hospital.
C	Escitalopram and risperidone did not differ in efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms and agitation in patients with AD.
C	Completion rates were higher for escitalopram-treated patients.
C	Replication in larger trials with ambulatory patients is needed.
B	Segmental muscle vibration ( SMV ) improves motor performances in neurological conditions , including stroke.
P	To determine if SMV modifies upper limb muscular activity in chronic stroke patients performing a reaching movement.
M	We randomized 22 chronic stroke patients to an experimental group ( EG ; n = 12 ) , receiving 10 sessions of exercise + 120 Hz SMV over the biceps brachii ( BB ) and the flexor carpi ulnaris ( FCU ) muscles , or to a control group ( CG ; n = 10 ) receiving exercise only.
M	All subjects performed a reaching movement with the affected side before and 4 weeks after therapy ended.
M	We recorded surface EMG activity of the anterior deltoid ( AD ) , posterior deltoid ( PD ) , BB , triceps brachii ( TB ) , FCU and extensor carpi radialis ( ECR ) muscles.
M	We calculated muscular onset times , modulation ratio , co-contractions and degree of contraction.
R	After SMV , onset times of the PD ( p = 0.03 ) , BB ( p = 0.02 ) and ECR ( p = 0.04 ) in the EG were less anticipated than at baseline ; the modulation ratio increased in AD ( p = 0.003 ) and BB ( p = 0.01 ) ; co-contractions decreased in the pairs BB/TB ( p = 0.007 ) , PD/BB ( p = 0.004 ) and AD/BB ( p = 0.01 ) ; and the degree of contraction decreased in BB ( p = 0.01 ).
C	The modulation of muscular function induced by SMV may aid to explain its action on smoothness and coordination of movements.
P	This study investigated changes in oral-verbal expressive language associated with improvements following 2 treatment periods of constraint-induced language therapy in 4 participants with stroke-induced chronic aphasia.
P	Generalization of treatment to untrained materials and to discourse production was also analyzed , as was the durability of the treatment effect.
M	Participants with aphasia were assessed using standardized measures and discourse tasks at 3 to 4 time points to document behavioral changes throughout each of two 30-hr treatment periods of constraint-induced language therapy.
M	Daily probes of trained and untrained materials were also administered.
R	Despite participant heterogeneity , behavioral results for each person with aphasia indicated a positive response to treatment following each treatment period indicated by performance on standardized tests , trained materials , or both.
R	Treatment effects generalized to some degree to untrained stimuli and to discourse measures and were generally maintained at follow-up testing.
C	Data support the utility of a 2nd treatment period.
C	Results are relevant to rehabilitation in chronic aphasia , confirming that significant language gains continue well past the point of spontaneous recovery and can occur in a relatively short time period.
C	Importantly , changes are not confined to a single treatment period , suggesting that people with aphasia may benefit from multiple doses of high-intensity treatment.
B	Despite the evidence of benefit , cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) remains highly underutilized.
B	The present study examined the effect of two inpatient and one outpatient strategy on CR utilization: allied healthcare provider completion of referral ( a policy that had been endorsed and approved by the cardiac program leadership in advance ; PRE-APPROVED ) ; CR intake appointment booked before hospital discharge ( PRE-BOOKED ) ; and early outpatient education provided at the CR program shortly after inpatient discharge ( EARLY ED ).
B	In this prospective observational study , 2 ,635 stable cardiac inpatients from 11 Ontario hospitals completed a sociodemographic survey , and clinical data were extracted from charts.
B	One year later , participants were a mailed survey that assessed CR use.
B	Participating inpatient units and CR programs to which patients were referred were coded to reflect whether each of the strategies was used ( yes/no ).
B	The effect of each strategy on participants' CR referral and enrollment was examined using generalized estimating equations.
R	A total of 1 ,809 participants completed the post-test survey.
R	Adjusted analyses revealed that the implementation of one of the inpatient strategies was significantly related to greater referral and enrollment ( PRE-APPROVED: OR = 1.96 , 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.05 , and OR = 2.91 , 95% CI = 2.20 to 3.85 , respectively ).
R	EARLY ED also resulted in significantly greater enrollment ( OR = 4.85 , 95% CI = 2.96 to 7.95 ).
C	These readily-implementable strategies could significantly increase access to and enrollment in CR for the cardiac population.
C	The impact of these strategies on wait times warrants exploration.
B	Community-based participatory research ( CI3PR ) holds the promise of improving the planning , conduct , and long-term translation of research findings into community settings.
P	This 2-year , exploratory study applied CI3PR structures and processes to the identification of individual , cultural and community factors associated with obesity among Pacific Islander ( PI ) youth in Southern California.
M	We describe the CBPR principles and strategies used by a community-university partnership to develop , implement , and report on the findings from assessments of obesity , physical activity , and nutritional intake among PI youth.
R	Although CBPR planning processes led to successes in community-based youth recruitment and retention , we learned key lessons regarding implementation of tailored assessment protocols , often involving problems arising from the university side of the Cl3PR collaborative.
C	CBPR has its strengths and limits ; more studies are needed that report on processes to increase our understanding of how to balance research rigor with community sustainability.
B	Obesity is a risk factor for renal cell ( or renal ) cancer.
B	The increasing prevalence of obesity may be contributing to the rising incidence of this cancer over the past several decades.
B	The effects of early-age obesity and change in body mass index ( BMI ) on renal cancer have been studied less thoroughly , and the influence of race has never been formally investigated.
M	Using data gathered as part of a large case-control study of renal cancer ( 1214 cases and 1234 controls ) , we investigated associations with BMI at several time points , as well as with height.
M	Adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) were computed using logistic regression modeling.
M	Race- and sex-stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate subgroup differences.
R	Obesity ( BMI >= 30 kg/m( 2 ) ) early in adulthood ( OR = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.1 to 2.4] ) and 5 years before diagnosis ( 1.6 [1.1 to 2.2] ) was associated with renal cancer.
R	The association with early- adult obesity was stronger among whites than blacks ( test for interaction , P = 0.006 ) , whereas the association with obesity near diagnosis was marginally stronger in women than men ( test for interaction , P = 0.08 ).
R	The strongest association with renal cancer was observed for obese whites both in early adulthood and before interview ( 2.6 [1.5 to 4.4] ) ; this association was not present among blacks.
R	Estimates of the annual excess rate of renal cancer ( per 100 ,000 persons ) attributed to both overweight and obesity ( BMI > 25 kg/m( 2 ) ) ranged from 9.9 among black men to 5.6 among white women.
C	Obesity , both early and later in life , is associated with an increased risk of renal cancer.
C	The association with early obesity seems to be stronger among whites than blacks.
B	Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty affecting up to 10% of British children that is associated with a wide range of cognitive , emotional and physical symptoms.
B	In the absence of effective conventional treatment , it is likely that parents will seek complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) to try and help their children.
B	However , little is known about the level of CAM use or the type of CAM used by dyslexic children.
P	This study assessed: ( 1 ) the lifetime use of CAM by dyslexic children , ( 2 ) the role of socio-demographic factors in CAM use by dyslexic children , ( 3 ) parental attitudes towards CAM use in the treatment of dyslexia , and ( 4 ) how parents' understanding of dyslexia affects CAM use.
M	A semi-structured questionnaire-based survey of parents of 148 dyslexic school children was undertaken.
M	The children had been recruited to a university research programme investigating the effectiveness of a complementary therapy for the treatment of learning difficulties.
R	Lifetime use of CAM was 55.4% ( 82 children ).
R	The most popular CAM approaches were nutritional supplements/special diets ( 63 children ) followed by homeopathy ( 29 children ) and osteopathy/chiropractic manipulation ( 29 children ).
R	Socio-demographic factors did not predict CAM use.
R	In total , parents of 101 dyslexic children reported that an interest in CAM for the treatment of dyslexia was based on their preference for CAM for their families more generally.
R	Parents who thought that dyslexia was a 'medical/health' disorder were more likely to have used CAM with their children ( p0.01 ) than other parents in this survey.
C	Educational and health professionals should be aware that many dyslexic children use CAM.
C	Parents of dyslexic children should be provided with evidence-based advice to help them make informed therapeutic choices.
P	Research development and regional consortium strategies are described to assist schools in all countries extend their gerontological nursing research productivity.
P	The strategies , collaboration and mentoring experiences , and outcomes are also shared to illustrate a highly successful approach in increasing faculty programs of nursing research in a focused area of inquiry.
M	A case description of gerontological nursing research development and regional consortium strategies in schools of nursing is used.
M	The regional consortium included 17 schools of nursing that are working to increase faculty programs of gerontological nursing research.
M	Survey responses describing publications , presentations , and research funding awards from 65 of 114 total faculty participants in consortium opportunities ( pilot and mentoring grant participants , participants in summer scholars' grantsmanship seminars ) were collected annually from 1995 through 2008 to describe outcomes.
R	From 1994 through 2008 , faculty participants from the consortium schools who responded to the annual surveys reported a total of 597 gerontological nursing publications , 527 presentations at research conferences , funding of 221 small and internal grants , and 130 external grant awards , including 47R-series grants and 4 K awards.
C	There is an urgent need for more nurse faculty with programs of research to inform the health care of persons and support the preparation of nurse clinicians and faculty.
C	The shortage of nurse scientists with active programs of gerontological research is especially serious and limits the number of faculty who are needed to prepare future gerontological nurses , particularly those with doctoral degrees who will assume faculty positions.
C	Further , junior faculty with a gerontological nursing research foci often lack the colleagues , mentors , and environments needed to develop successful research careers.
C	The outcomes of the development and regional consortium strategies suggest that the principles of extending collaboration , mentoring , and resource sharing are useful to augment faculty research opportunities , networking and support , and to increase productivity in individual schools.
C	Clinical relevance includes: ( a ) implications for preparing nurse scientists and academicians who are and will be needed to train nurses for clinical practice , and ( b ) development of more faculty programs of research to provide systematic evidence to inform nursing practice.
P	The School-to-Work ( STW ) Opportunities Act was passed to aid students in transitioning from education to employment by offering work-based learning opportunities.
P	In the United States , 72% of high schools offer work-based learning opportunities for credit.
P	This is the first study to describe school performance and school-based behaviors among students enrolled in STW programs and compare them with nonworking and other-working students.
M	In 2003 , a questionnaire was administered to five school districts and one large urban school in Wisconsin.
M	Between 2008 and 2010 , analyses were completed to characterize STW students and compare them with other students.
R	Of the 6 ,519 students aged 14-18 years included in the analyses , 461 were involved in an STW program ( 7% ) , 3 ,108 were non-working ( 48% ) , and 2 ,950 were other-working students ( 45% ).
R	Compared with other students , STW students were less likely to have a grade point average >2.0 , more likely to have three or more unexcused absences from school , and more likely to spend <1 hour in school-sponsored activities.
R	Holding multiple jobs also negatively affected a student's academic performance.
C	School-to-Work students reported poorer academic performance and more unhealthy school-related behaviors compared with nonworking students and other-working students.
C	Whereas many factors have a role in why students perform poorly in school , more research on students enrolled in STW programs is needed to understand whether participating has a negative impact on students' academic achievement.

B	Research is essential to identify and prioritize health needs and to develop appropriate strategies to improve health outcomes.
B	In the last decade , non-academic research capacity strengthening trainings in sub-Saharan Africa , coupled with developing research infrastructure and the provision of individual mentorship support , has been used to build health worker skills.
B	The objectives of this review are to describe different training approaches to research capacity strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa outside academic programs , assess methods used to evaluate research capacity strengthening activities , and learn about the challenges facing research capacity strengthening and the strategies/innovations required to overcome them.
M	The PubMed database was searched using nine search terms and articles were included if 1 ) they explicitly described research capacity strengthening training activities , including information on program duration , target audience , immediate program outputs and outcomes ; 2 ) all or part of the training program took place in sub-Saharan African countries ; 3 ) the training activities were not a formal academic program ; 4 ) papers were published between 2000 and 2013 ; and 5 ) both abstract and full paper were available in English.
R	The search resulted in 495 articles , of which 450 were retained ; 14 papers met all inclusion criteria and were included and analysed.
R	In total , 4136 people were trained , of which 2939 were from Africa.
R	Of the 14 included papers , six fell in the category of short-term evaluation period and eight in the long-term evaluation period.
R	Conduct of evaluations and use of evaluation frameworks varied between short and long term models and some trainings were not evaluated.
R	Evaluation methods included tests , surveys , interviews , and systems approach matrix.
C	Research capacity strengthening activities in sub-Saharan Africa outside of academic settings provide important contributions to developing in-country capacity to participate in and lead research.
C	Institutional support , increased funds , and dedicated time for research activities are critical factors that lead to the development of successful programs.
C	Further , knowledge sharing through scientific articles with sufficient detail is needed to enable replication of successful models in other settings.
B	Psychiatric ward design may make an important contribution to patient outcomes and well-being.
B	However , research is hampered by an inability to assess its effects robustly.
B	This paper reports on a study which deployed innovative methods to capture service user and staff perceptions of ward design.
M	User generated measures of the impact of ward design were developed and tested on four acute adult wards using participatory methodology.
M	Additionally , inpatients took photographs to illustrate their experience of the space in two wards.
M	Data were compared across wards.
R	Satisfactory reliability indices emerged based on both service user and staff responses.
R	Black and minority ethnic ( BME ) service users and those with a psychosis spectrum diagnosis have more positive views of the ward layout and fixtures.
R	Staff members have more positive views than service users , while priorities of staff and service users differ.
R	Inpatient photographs prioritise hygiene , privacy and control and address symbolic aspects of the ward environment.
C	Participatory and visual methodologies can provide robust tools for an evaluation of the impact of psychiatric ward design on users.
B	Person-centeredness has had substantial uptake in the academic literature on care of older people and people with dementia.
B	However , challenges exist in interpreting and synthesizing the evidence on effects of providing person-centered care , as the person-centered components of some intervention studies are unclear -targeting very different and highly specific aspects of person-centeredness , as well as not providing empirical data to indicate the extent to which care practice was actually perceived to become more person-centered post-intervention.
M	The study employed a quasi-experimental , one-group pre-test-post-test design with a 12-month follow-up to explore intervention effects on person-centeredness of care and the environment ( primary endpoints ) , and on staff strain and stress of conscience ( secondary endpoints ).
R	The intervention resulted in significantly higher scores on person-centeredness of care at follow-up , and the facility was rated as being significantly more hospitable at follow-up.
R	A significant reduction of staff stress of conscience was also found at follow-up , which suggests that , to a larger extent , staff could provide the care and activities they wanted to provide after the intervention.
C	The results indicated that an interactive and step-wise action-research intervention consisting of knowledge translation , generation , and dissemination , based on national guidelines for care of people with dementia , increased the staff self-reported person-centeredness of care practice , perceived hospitality of the setting , and reduced staff stress of conscience by enabling staff to provide the care and activities they want to provide.
B	Awake bruxism is defined as an oral parafunctional activity that includes clenching and grinding of teeth during wakefulness.
B	Confirming the possible related anatomy and the clinical significance of awake bruxism in geriatric hospitals is the aim of this study.
M	We analyzed the medical records of 503 patients who were admitted to hospital from April to June 2008.
M	After the recognition of bruxism , the clinical , brain imaging studies and statistical parametric mapping ( SPM ) of brain single photon emission computed tomography were performed.
R	In each disease group , five of 125 Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) patients ( 4.0% ) , three of 11 frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) patients ( 27.3% ) , seven of 230 stroke patients ( including two patients related to citalopram , 3.0% ) , one of 45 Parkinson's disease patients ( 2.2% ) and four of 17 hydrocephalus patients ( 23.5% ) had bruxism.
R	Even though awake bruxism occurred early after stroke onset , it occurred late after AD and FTD onset.
R	This occurred in a far advanced stage of AD , while it occurred in a moderately advanced stage of FTD.
R	SPM analysis in AD and FTD patients with awake bruxism revealed significant hypoperfusion in frontotemporal and other subcortical structures.
R	Surface electromyography recordings from the masseter muscle showed rhythmic regular motor activity at a rate of 1-2/s.
C	This study suggests that awake bruxism is encountered not infrequently in various diseases in geriatric hospitals.
C	It is frequently observed in FTD and normal pressure hydrocephalus , which characteristically shows frontal lobe dysfunction.
C	These facts and SPM analysis show that awake bruxism can be regarded as a frontal neurological sign of various neurological disorders.
B	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is one of the most common genetic deficiencies , which approximately 400 million people in the world suffer from.
B	According to authors' initial search , numerous studies have been carried out in Iran regarding molecular variants of this enzyme.
B	Thus , this meta-analysis presented a reliable estimation about prevalence of different types of molecular mutations of G6PD Enzyme in Iran.
M	Keywords "glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase or G6PD , Mediterranean or Chatham or Cosenza and mutation , Iran or Iranian and their Persian equivalents" were searched in different databases.
M	Moreover , reference list of the published studies were examined to increase sensitivity and to select more studies.
M	After studying titles and abstracts of retrieved articles , excluding the repeated and unrelated ones , and evaluating quality of articles , documents were selected.
M	Data was analyzed using STATA.
R	After performing systematic review , 22 papers were entered this meta-analysis and 1698 subjects were examined concerning G6PD molecular mutation.
R	In this meta-analysis , prevalence of Mediterranean mutation , Chatham mutation and Cosenza mutation in Iran was estimated 78.2% , 9.1% and 0.5% respectively.
C	This meta-analysis showed that in spite of prevalence of different types of G6PD molecular mutations in center , north , north-west and west of Iran , the most common molecular mutations in people with G6PD deficiency in Iran , like other Mediterranean countries and countries around Persian Gulf , were Mediterranean mutation , Chatham mutation and Cosenza mutation.
C	It is also recommended that future studies may focus on races and regions which haven't been taken into consideration up to now.
B	Tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) is a neurological motor complication eventually arising in one-third of patients chronically exposed to antipsychotic drugs.
B	Some orodental peripheral factors have been reported to influence TD.
P	To measure orodental factors such as temporomandibular joint function , static occlusal contacts , and denture condition , and attempt correlations with orofacial TD intensity.
M	In this exploratory cross-sectional pilot study , 31 subjects between 30 and 75 years of age were divided in two groups displaying minimal to mild , or moderate to severe orofacial TD , respectively , and underwent a detailed oral , dental , and prosthetic evaluation to capture various aspects of oral health compared between the two groups.
M	Blinded video-based TD ratings along a validated scale were obtained to compare dentulous and edentulous subjects , and contrast TD intensity in complete denture wearers with and without their own prostheses.
R	None of the factors examined tightly correlated with orofacial TD intensity.
R	However , edentulism was associated with a higher median orofacial TD rating compared to the dentulous group ( p = 0.001 ).
R	Further , a significant intra-subject difference was observed in the edentulous subjects rated with their own complete dentures in place or not ( p = 0.028 ) , the dentures attenuating the mean orofacial ratings by 21.8 +/- 7.3%.
C	Of all orodental factors considered , only edentulism and complete denture wearing influenced oral TD expression , calling for the close monitoring of the dental status in antipsychotic drug-exposed patients to prevent tooth loss.
C	Further studies to measure the impact of an adequate prosthodontic rehabilitation in edentulous subjects with orofacial TD seem warranted.

P	Rural residents are less likely to obtain optimal care for many serious conditions and have poorer health outcomes than those residing in more urban areas.
P	We determined whether rural vs urban residence affected postdischarge medication persistence and 1 year outcomes after stroke.
M	The Adherence eValuation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal ( AVAIL ) study is a multicenter registry of stroke patients enrolled in 101 hospitals nationwide.
M	Medications were recorded at hospital discharge and again after 3 and 12 months.
M	Persistence was defined as continuation of prescribed discharge medications.
M	Participants were categorized as living in rural or urban settings by cross-referencing home ZIP code with metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) designation.
R	Rural patients were younger , more likely to be white , married , smokers , and less likely to be college graduates.
R	There was no difference in stroke type or working status compared to urban patients , and there were minor differences in comorbid conditions.
R	There were no differences based on rural vs urban residence in medication persistence at 3 or 12 months postdischarge and no differences in outcomes of recurrent stroke or rehospitalization at 12 months.
C	Despite differences in patient characteristics , there was no difference in medication persistence or outcomes between rural and urban dwellers after hospitalization for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ).
B	Understanding the potential impact of cannabis use on cardiovascular health is increasingly important as cannabis use rises in the U.S.
P	This study evaluated the associations between regular cannabis use , with and without tobacco co-use , and cardiovascular outcomes.
M	Analysis of a limited dataset obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys , a platform integrating electronic health record data.
M	Matched controls using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers were defined for: 1 ) cannabis-using patients ( n = 8 ,944 ; 43% female ) ; and subgroups of cannabis-using patients: 2 ) with an encounter diagnosis for tobacco use disorder ( TUD ; n = 4 ,682 ) ; and 3 ) without a TUD diagnosis ( non-TUD ; n = 4 ,262 ).
M	Patients had >= 1 blood pressure measurement and blood chemistry lab result in the MetroHealth System ( Cleveland , Ohio ).
M	Cannabis-using patients had an encounter diagnosis of cannabis abuse/dependence and/or >= 2 cannabis-positive urine drug screens.
M	Control patients , with no cannabis-use-documentation , were matched to the cannabis-using patients on demographics , residential zip code median income , body mass index , and , for the total sample , TUD-status.
M	Outcomes were encounter diagnosis ( yes/no ) of cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , heart arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , and all-cause mortality.
R	TUD-patients had the greatest prevalence of cardiovascular disease , regardless of cannabis-use indication.
R	In the total sample and non-TUD subgroup , regular cannabis use was significantly associated with greater risk for CVA , arrhythmia , SAH , and mortality.
R	In the TUD subgroup , regular cannabis use was significantly associated with greater risk for arrhythmia and SAH.
C	Cannabis use is associated with significantly greater risk of adverse cardiovascular diagnoses and overall death , particularly in non-tobacco users.
B	Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals experiencing non-clinical psychosis ( NCP ) represent a critical group for improving understanding of etiological factors underlying the broader psychosis continuum.
B	Although a wealth of evidence supports widespread neural dysfunction in formal psychosis , there has been little empirical evidence to inform our understanding of putative vulnerability markers or brain structure in NCP.
B	In this study , we examined the neural correlates of spontaneous movement abnormalities , a biomarker previously detected in NCP that is linked to abnormalities in the striatal dopamine.
M	We screened a total of 1285 adolescents/young adults , and those scoring in the upper 15th percentile on a NCP scale were invited to participate ; 20 of those invited agreed and these individuals were matched with healthy controls.
M	Participants were administered a structural scan , clinical interviews , and an instrumental motor assessment.
R	The NCP group showed elevated force variability and smaller putamen ( but not caudate ) , and there was a significant relationship between motor dysfunction and striatal abnormalities for the sample.
R	Elevated force variability was associated with both higher positive and negative symptoms , and there was a strong trend ( p=.06 ) to suggest that smaller left putamen volumes were associated with elevated positive symptoms.
C	The results are among the first to suggest an association between neural structure and a risk marker in NCP.
C	Findings indicate that vulnerabilities seen in schizophrenia also characterize the lower end of the psychosis spectrum.

B	In chronic pain , patients' coping affects their adaptation.
B	In two studies , we examined the role of pain catastrophizing , a maladaptive coping strategy , in pain , distress , and disability.
B	In Study 2 we compared catastrophizing to pain acceptance and to other coping strategies.
M	Study 1.
M	Chronic pain patients ( N = 428 ) were assessed four times as to their pain , disability , catastrophizing , and distress ( depression and anxiety ).
M	Study 2.
M	Patients ( N = 165 ) were assessed as to coping and pain acceptance , pain , related distress , depression , hope , suicidal ideations , perceived burdensomeness , and thwarted belongingness.
R	Study 1.
R	A Structural Equation Modeling ( SEM ) analysis revealed that Time 1 Pain-based catastrophizing prospectively predicted pain ( beta = .36 , p < .001 ).
R	Distress prospectively predicted pain related disability ( beta = .34 , p < .001 ).
R	Study 2.
R	Pain-based catastrophizing predicted sensory pain ( beta = .22 , p = .018 ) , depression ( beta = .43 , p < .001 ) , and suicidal ideation ( O.R. = 1.88 ) , which were also predicted by depression and perceived burdensomeness.
R	Distraction predicted sensory pain ( beta = .21 , p = .017 , respectively ).
R	Activity engagement predicted low levels of depression ( beta = -.29 , p < .001 , respectively ) , and willingness to accept pain predicted low pain-related distress ( beta = -.16 , p = .05 ).
C	Pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance constitute risk and resilience factors.
C	Both should be assessed and targeted in pain management.
P	Child sexual abuse ( CSA ) is one of the most serious public health problems among children and adolescents , owing to its widespread prevalence and serious health consequences.
P	The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of , and characteristics and circumstances associated with , CSA.
M	An epidemiological survey was conducted on a nationally representative sample of 6 ,787 ninth-grade students ( 15.5 +/- .66 years of age ) in Switzerland.
M	Self-reported computer-assisted questionnaires were administered between September 2009 and May 2010.
M	Various forms of sexual victimization were assessed using the newly developed Child Sexual Abuse Questionnaire.
R	Overall , 40.2% and 17.2% of girls and boys , respectively , reported having experienced at least one type of CSA event.
R	Lifetime prevalence rates were 35.1% and 14.9% , respectively , for CSA without physical contact , 14.9% and 4.8% for CSA with physical contact without penetration , and 2.5% and .6% for CSA with penetration among girls and boys.
R	The most frequently experienced event was sexual harassment via the Internet.
R	More than half of female victims and more than 70% of male victims reported having been abused by juvenile perpetrators.
R	Depending on the specific event , only 44.4%-58.4% of female victims and 5.8%-38% of male victims disclosed CSA , mostly to peers.
C	The present study confirms the widespread prevalence of CSA.
C	The high prevalence of CSA via the Internet and the frequent reports of juvenile perpetrators suggest emerging trends in CSA.
C	Low disclosure rates , especially among male victims , and reluctance to disclose events to family members and officials may impede timely intervention.

B	Across several research studies comparing the individual placement and support ( IPS ) approach to traditional vocational services , the approach has achieved employment outcomes superior to comparison conditions.
B	However , to understand the efficacy of IPS , it is equally important to consider what is more or less effective as viewed by the IPS participants.
P	To investigate participants' experiences of IPS participation and their experiences of receiving support from an employment specialist ( ES ).
M	Interviews were conducted with 17 persons with severe mental illness.
M	The interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis.
M	The principles of informed consent and the voluntary nature of participation were included as ethical considerations.
R	Participation in IPS was associated with hope , meaning and an individualized support provided by the ES.
R	The skills of the ES facilitated the relationship with the participant and the contact with the labour market.
R	However , to make a change happen , everybody involved in IPS had to contribute.
C	These findings have endorsed the guiding principles of IPS and emphasized the ES's role and skills during IPS as well as the participant's motivation.
P	The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychological distress is an independent risk factor for recurrentcardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ).
M	A prospective cohort of studies that measured psychological distress and the incidence of recurrent cardiac events in the adult population were included.
M	Three computerized databases were assessed ( PubMed , CINAHL , and PSYCINFO ).
M	Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to determine summary estimates of risks of major recurrent cardiac events associated with each psychological distress.
M	Of 506 publications identified , 33 met inclusion criteria , and 24 studies were used to estimate effect size of psychological distress on recurrent cardiac events.
R	Mean number in the research sample was 736 and mean time of follow-up was 4.0 years.
R	Depression , anxiety , anger , and hostility as psychological factors were studied.
R	According to estimation of effect size using random model effect , depression ( OR=1.39 , 95% Cl: 1.22-1.57 ) , anxiety ( OR=1.22 ,95% Cl: 0.96-1.56 ) , and anger/hostility ( OR=1.29 , 95% Cl: 1.07-1.57 ) CAD patients in significantly increased risk for recurrent cardiac events.
C	Finding suggests that psychological distress in forms of depression , anxiety , anger , and hostility impact unfavorably on recurrent cardiac events in CAD patients.
P	This study investigated consonant cluster acquisition in Chinese-influenced Malaysian English ( ChME )-speaking children.
M	This cross-sectional study involved 262 typically developing ChME-speaking children ( 138 girls , 124 boys ) ages 3 to 7 years old.
M	A single-word picture-naming task , which contained 66 words and targeted 32 syllable-initial ( SI ) and 14 syllable-final ( SF ) consonant clusters , was administered.
R	Older children produced more correct productions than younger children , and there was no sex effect for consonant cluster production.
R	SF consonant clusters were more accurate than SI consonant clusters among the younger children.
R	The overall sequence of SI consonant cluster accuracy based on cluster categories from most to least accurate was /s/+ C , C + /w/ , C + /j/ , C + /l/ , and C + /r/ , whereas for SF consonant clusters , the order was C + stop , C + /s/ , nasal + C , and /l/+ C. Two-element clusters consistently had higher accuracy in comparison to three-element clusters across the age groups.
R	The overall consonant cluster accuracy of the present study showed similar patterns to those found in previous studies of Standard English.
C	The findings of the study will be useful in the assessment of consonant cluster production of ChME-speaking children.
B	Small-scale , home-like care environments are increasingly implemented in institutional nursing care as a model to promote resident-directed care , although evidence on its effects is sparse.
B	This study focuses on the effects of small-scale living facilities on the behavior of residents with dementia and use of physical restraints and psychotropic drugs.
M	A quasi-experimental study was conducted comparing residents in two types of long-term institutional nursing care ( i.e. small-scale living facilities and traditional psychogeriatric wards ) on three time points: at baseline and follow-ups after six and 12 months.
M	Residents were matched at baseline on cognitive and functional status to increase comparability of groups at baseline.
M	Nurses assessed neuropsychiatric and depressive symptoms , agitation , social engagement , and use of physical restraints using questionnaires.
M	Psychotropic drug use was derived from residents' medical records.
R	In total , 259 residents were included: 124 in small-scale living facilities and 135 controls.
R	Significantly fewer physical restraints and psychotropic drugs were used in small-scale living facilities compared with traditional wards.
R	Residents in small-scale living facilities were significantly more socially engaged , at baseline and after six months follow-up , and displayed more physically non-aggressive behavior after 12 months than residents in traditional wards.
R	No other differences were found.
C	This study suggests positive effects of small-scale living facilities on the use of physical restraints and psychotropic drugs.
C	However , the results for behavior were mixed.
C	More research is needed to gain an insight on the relationship between dementia care environment and other residents' outcomes.
P	This research analyzes the trend of reference service in public libraries in Japan , and reconsiders the meaning of reference service.
M	Statistics about reference service of the public libraries in Shizuoka , Toyama and Kanagawa , and prefectural libraries were analyzed.
M	In addition , issues concerning reference service were derived from the argument about the Market Test in Osaka.
R	In Japanese public libraries in which reference service is active , the number of reference questions is generally decreasing in recent years.
R	In contrast , the number of reference questions is increasing in the libraries in which reference service is inactive.
R	And the trend of number of reference questions mainly depends on the number of easy questions.
R	This result casts doubt on the generally accepted statement that reference questions are becoming more difficult in the internet era.
R	Furthermore , not a few people consider that reference service is excessive.
R	Therefore , it is difficult to maintain the level of resources for reference service , and it is necessary to redesign the structure and strategy for reference service.
B	Although sleep is considered an essential part of individuals' lives , there are no previous studies analysing how sleep duration affects the levels of life satisfaction reported by males and females with disabilities.
B	Objective/
P	To analyse and compare the impact of hours of sleep on life satisfaction scores reported by people without and with disabilities ( stratified by sex ) in Germany.
M	Using data taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the period 2008-2013 , we estimate life satisfaction equations for males and females ( running a fixed-effects model ) which include a set of variables measuring the number of sleep hours on workdays and weekends.
R	A higher number of sleep hours on workdays increase life satisfaction for all males and females.
R	However , the contribution of each hour of sleep on workdays is greater for males with disabilities in terms of life satisfaction , whereas for females no significant differences by disability status have been found.
R	Although sleep hours on weekends also increase life satisfaction , the magnitude of the coefficients is relatively higher than that found for the corresponding hours of sleep on workdays , but only for the male sample ( disabled or not ).
C	The participation and commitment of policymakers , governments , trade unions , employers , and health care professionals are key aspects for developing and formulating new guidelines and specific measures that promote a healthy lifestyle and increase sleep duration.
C	Such guidelines and measures are of essence for people with disabilities who are employed ( e.g. using brief sleep opportunities during prolonged work periods , which can contribute to reducing fatigue , stress and anxiety ).

B	The prevalence of tobacco cigarette smoking in the US has declined to approximately 15% , yet , it remains over 90% among individuals with opioid use disorder regardless of whether they are currently using opioids illicitly or as opioid substitution therapy.
B	This disparity raises the question of whether opioids facilitate smoking among individuals with opioid use disorder and whether opioid antagonists may reduce it.
P	Determine whether injectable extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) treatment of opioid use disorder patients is associated with a spontaneous smoking reduction.
P	We hypothesized that treatment with XR-NTX for would lead to a reduction in smoking in tobacco cigarette smokers with opioid use disorder.
M	We analyzed data from 64 tobacco cigarette smokers 38% with opioid use disorder who were induced on XR-NTX for prevention of relapse to opioids.
M	The number of cigarettes smoked per day and opioid-related craving and withdrawal were assessed at baseline and during treatment.
R	Smoking was reduced from 14.4 +/- 1.0 to 9.8 +/- 1.0( p < 0.001 ) cigarettes per day after one month and 8.6 +/- 1.1 cigarettes per day after two months of treatment.
R	Daily cigarette consumption was positively correlated with the pre-treatment frequency of opioid use and opioid-related craving during the XR-NTX treatment.
C	XR-NTX treatment in smokers with opioid use disorder was associated with a 29% decline in daily cigarette consumption.
C	Together with prior evidence of increased smoking during opioid agonist therapy , our finding suggests a pharmacodynamic interaction between nicotine and opioid systems that could influence treatment choices in this population.
C	Our findings merit confirmation in a prospective controlled study.

P	This study was conducted to develop and test the effects of an elder health promotion program and apply strategies for elder health leader training sessions with elders at senior citizen halls.
M	A nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used.
M	Participants were 49 elders at a senior citizen hall ( intervention: 27 , control: 22 ).
M	The elder health promotion program consisted of health education and exercise.
M	A professional leader led the program for 4 weeks , and then an elder health leader and research assistant led for 8 weeks ( total 12 weeks ).
M	Scales for elder health promoting behaviors , perceived health status , life satisfaction and senior citizen hall capability were used and physical fitness levels were measured.
M	Data were collected between April 21 and July 28 , 2010 and analyzed using Chi-square , Fisher's exact test , t-test , and repeated measure ANOVA with SPSS/WIN 12.0.
R	Health promoting behaviors , physical fitness , perceived health status , and senior citizen hall capacity were significantly better in the experimental group after the intervention compared to the control group.
C	Study findings indicate that elder health promotion programs applying strategies of elder health leader training are effective and can be recommended as nursing interventions for health promotion of these elders.
B	Culturally valid measures of depression for Spanish-speaking Hispanic women are important for developing and implementing effective interventions to reduce health disparities.
B	The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale ( CES-D ) is a widely used measure of depression.
B	Differential item functioning has been studied using language preference as a proxy for acculturation , but it is unknown if the results were due to acculturation or the language of administration.
P	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of acculturation , defined with a dimensional measure , to Spanish CES-D item responses.
M	Spanish-speaking Hispanic women ( n = 504 ) were recruited for a randomized controlled trial of Salud , Educacion , Prevencion y Autocuidado ( Health , Education , Prevention , and Self-Care ).
M	Acculturation , an important dimension of variation within the diverse U.S. Hispanic community , was defined by high or low scores on the Americanism subscale of the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale.
M	Differential item functioning for each of the 20 CES-D items between more acculturated and less acculturated women was tested using ordinal logistic regression.
R	No items on the Depressed Affect , Somatic Activity , or Positive Affect sub-scales showed meaningful differential item functioning , but 1 item ( "People were unfriendly" ) on the Interpersonal subscale had small results ( R( 2 ) = 1.1% ).
C	The majority of CES-D items performed similarly for Spanish-speaking Hispanic women with high and low acculturation.
C	Less acculturated women responded more positively to "People were unfriendly ," despite having an equivalent level of depression , than did more acculturated women.
C	Possibilities for improving this item are proposed.
B	Achondroplasia , the most common form of chondrodysplasia ( inherited skeletal dysplasia ) , is characterized by a significant delay in the development of communication and motor skills , particularly during the first 2 years.
B	Although some information regarding timing of development for children with achondroplasia is available , no study has evaluated simultaneously the pattern of skill development across multiple key developmental areas.
M	This study used a retrospective questionnaire to quantify developmental data on milestone achievement.
M	Twenty families of children with achondroplasia throughout Australia and New Zealand were asked to document age of acquisition for 41 gross motor , fine motor , and communication and feeding milestones.
M	More than one half of the items assessed were milestones identified in the Australian State Government Personal Health Record Books.
M	The results are compared with previously available information regarding development of motor skills by a cohort of American children with achondroplasia.
R	Although the results support previously reported delays in gross motor and communication skill development , fine motor development does not seem to be as delayed as previously suggested.
R	information on development of self-feeding skills is presented for the first time and occurs later in this group than the typically developing population.
R	We describe 2 distinctive and previously unreported methods of transitioning between static positions commonly used by children with achondroplasia.
C	Delays were reported across gross motor and communication and feeding skills but were not observed during development of fine motor skills.
C	Additional information is also offered regarding a variety of unusual movement strategies demonstrated by young children with achondroplasia.
P	To explore barriers and enablers to community walking perceived by people with lower limb amputation.
M	Three focus groups ( n = 14 participants ) , using purposive sampling , were conducted with people with lower limb amputation who used a prosthesis to walk in the community.
M	Three investigators analyzed transcripts using thematic content analysis.
R	Themes aligned with the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health domains.
R	Barriers related to body function and structure included prosthetic function , residual limb integrity , phantom limb pain and other medical issues , with optimal prosthetic function and adequate fitness identified as enablers.
R	Personal barriers included challenges adjusting to change , whereas personal enablers included being able to adjust to change , having a positive attitude , goal setting and a purpose for community walking.
R	Environmental barriers included physical ( e.g. , terrain , crowds , climate ) and social ( e.g. , unwanted attention and finances ).
R	Environmental enablers included aids , transport , preparation , social support and finances.
R	Community walking was essential to participation in work , leisure , social activities and family roles.
C	Walking in the community for people with a lower limb amputation presents many barriers , but enablers have also been identified.
C	Targeted assessments and interventions , and appropriate environmental planning may assist in minimizing barriers to community walking.
B	fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders is a term used to describe a range of physical , cognitive and behavioural deficits in the offspring of women who drank alcohol during pregnancy.
B	A growing body of evidence suggests alcohol consumption in the presence of poor maternal nutrition may increase the risk of harm to the developing fetus.
P	to investigate relationships between maternal dietary patterns and alcohol consumption , and explore which factors influence women's decisions about what to eat and drink during pregnancy.
M	a mixed methods study comprising a questionnaire ( paper-based and online ) and semi-structured , in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of women who completed the questionnaire.
M	women were eligible for inclusion if they were >= 16 years of age , pregnant and living in the UK and were recruited through antenatal clinics , specialist substance misuse antenatal clinics or via social media platforms ; 350 women completed a questionnaire and a sub-sample of 6 women participated in an interview.
M	the questionnaire comprised the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption to measure alcohol consumption patterns and a Food Frequency Questionnaire to measure dietary intake.
M	Dietary pattern analysis was conducted using Principle Components Analysis and linear regression models were used to explore relationships between dietary pattern scores and alcohol consumption.
M	Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics.
M	Semi-structured , in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face and analysed thematically.
R	two key dietary patterns were derived.
R	Women who reported frequent alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy were more likely to adhere to the 'Prudent' dietary pattern compared to those who abstained.
R	No relationships were observed between alcohol consumption and adherence to the 'Cafeteria' dietary pattern.
R	Six key themes were identified through the qualitative analysis: ( 1 ) pregnancy as a time to review behaviour ; ( 2 ) listen to your body - it will tell you what you need ; ( 3 ) treats are still important - on special occasions ; ( 4 ) social and cultural expectations constrain behaviour ; ( 5 ) inconsistent or ambiguous information creates uncertainty ; and 6 ) confidence increases following a successful pregnancy.
C	those who drink low levels of alcohol during pregnancy may have better quality diets compared to women who report no alcohol consumption.
C	The reasons for this are complex and influenced by social context and previous pregnancy experience , which should be considered when healthcare professionals provide advice during this period.
B	Childhood/adolescent obesity and stunting are associated with heightened risk of metabolic syndrome.
B	Understanding the prevalence and patterns of stunting , the emergence of overweight/obesity in children and adolescents and the concomitant risk for metabolic syndrome is of critical importance for public health policy.
P	To investigate the prevalence of overweight , obesity and stunting in school children and adolescents aged 6-19 years in Beijing and to compare the differences in screening rates by national and international references.
M	School children aged 6-19 years in Xuanwu , Haidian and Fangshan district were selected.
M	Overweight and obesity in the children was screened for using the International Obesity Task-force ( IOTF ) and Chinese standards.
M	Stunting was defined as height-for-age Z-score ( HAZ ) less than -2 using the 2009 Chinese standards and 2007 WHO reference.
R	A total of 99482 children were included in this survey.
R	The prevalences of overweight and obesity are 17.7% and 14.4% in the Chinese standard , but they are 18.1% and 8.6% in the IOTF standard ; there were significant differences between the prevalences of these two standards ( p<0.01 ).
R	The prevalences of overweight/obesity in boys are all significantly higher than that of girls in every age-group ( p<0.05 ).
R	Overall there was stunting in 2630 children and adolescents ( 2.6% ) according to the Chinese standards , with 2.8% in boys , higher than the 2.5% of girls ( p<0.01 ).
R	According to WHO standards , there was stunting in 1201 children and adolescents ( 1.2% ) with 1.1% in boys and 1.3% in girls ( p<0.05 ).
R	The prevalence of stunting in urban areas was 1.3% , which is significantly lower than that of suburban areas , at 3.9% ( p<0.01 ).
C	The prevalence of overweight/obesity in children and adolescents aged 6-19 years in Beijing was close to western countries , which should be highly valued when considering public health policies and the problem of growth stunting should not be ignored.
B	Although the clinical efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) has been well established in patients with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression , the physiological mechanism and changes in regional cerebral function after ECT are unclear.
M	We recruited 16 depressed patients who underwent ECT , and 11 healthy controls.
M	The change in cerebral glucose metabolism was evaluated before and after a series of ECT using [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ).
R	Before ECT , the patient group showed significant hypometabolism in the superior frontal gyrus , and hypermetabolism in the inferior temporal gyri compared with healthy controls , and these abnormalities remained after ECT.
R	Comparisons between pre- and post-ECT metabolic activity revealed decreased regional metabolism in the frontotemporal neocortical areas after ECT , while increased metabolism was found in the right medial temporal structures including amygdala and pons.
R	In addition , a decrease in glucose metabolism in the frontotemporo-parietal regions correlated with an increase in glucose metabolism in the right medial temporal regions across subjects.
C	There was considerable variability in the interval between the last ECT and FDG-PET scan.
C	Depressed subjects were maintained on medication.
C	The subjects included both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder patients , as well as both ECT responders and non-responders.
C	Depression refractory to pharmacotherapy might have functional deficits in specific circumscribed frontal and temporal structures.
C	ECT resolves the clinical symptoms without largely affecting these brain metabolic abnormalities.
C	In contrast , ECT shifts the balance of corticolimbic function , which might explain how ECT ameliorates symptoms of depression in patients.

P	Youth with special health care needs ( YSHCN ) increasingly live into adulthood , and approximately 500 ,000 U.S. youth transition from pediatric to adult health care systems annually.
P	Through a systematic literature review , we sought to ( 1 ) determine adult outcomes for YSHCN who have no special transition interventions and ( 2 ) identify evidence for strategies that lead to better outcomes , in particular , access to adult health care.
M	We searched the medical , nursing , psychology , and social science literature and reviewed selected articles' reference lists.
M	Transition experts also recommended relevant articles.
M	Search criteria included health conditions , transition-related activities , and health care and related outcomes.
M	We selected English-language articles published from 1986 to 2010 , with an abstract , description of transition-related interventions ( objective 2 ) , and posttransition outcomes.
M	Investigators abstracted study design , population , sample size , description of intervention , data collection methods , and findings.
R	The search yielded 3 ,370 articles , of which 15 met study criteria.
R	Although many YSHCN appear to make the transition to adult health providers successfully , some experience serious gaps in outcomes ; those with more complex conditions or with conditions affecting the nervous system appear to have less good transitions.
R	Some evidence supports introducing YSHCN to adult providers before leaving the pediatric system ; one study supports using care coordinators to improve outcomes.
C	Evidence regarding programs to facilitate transition for YSHCN is inconclusive.
C	Weak evidence suggests that meeting adult providers before transfer may facilitate posttransition access to care.
C	We recommend additional studies with strong research designs to guide best practice in preparing YSHCN for adulthood.

B	Extreme heat events are the number one cause of weather-related fatalities in the United States.
B	The current system of alert for extreme heat events does not take into account intra-urban spatial variation in risk.
B	The purpose of this study is to evaluate a potential method to improve spatial delineation of risk from extreme heat events in urban environments by integrating sociodemographic risk factors with estimates of land surface temperature derived from thermal remote sensing data.
R	Comparison of logistic regression models indicates that supplementing known sociodemographic risk factors with remote sensing estimates of land surface temperature improves the delineation of intra-urban variations in risk from extreme heat events.
C	Thermal remote sensing data can be utilized to improve understanding of intra-urban variations in risk from extreme heat.
C	The refinement of current risk assessment systems could increase the likelihood of survival during extreme heat events and assist emergency personnel in the delivery of vital resources during such disasters.
B	The increasing prevalence of residents with dementia in Nursing Homes ( NH ) leads to a demanding work with high physical and psychological workloads.
B	This study focuses on NH nurses and their satisfaction with quality of care for residents with dementia ( SQCD ) and its impact on nurses' general health , burnout and work ability.
M	Two-wave ( 2007/2009 ) self-report questionnaire data of 305 nurses ( RNs and nurses' aides ) from 50 German NHs.
R	58.6% ( 2007 ) and 64.9% ( 2009 ) of the respondents reported satisfaction with the quality of care of the dementia residents.
R	However , when dissatisfied , this was perceived as substantial work stressor and was adversely associated with nurses' individual resource outcomes.
R	Those nurses who between 2007 and 2009 had become dissatisfied or were dissatisfied at both measurements showed the most adverse scorings for burnout , general health and work ability.
C	The findings imply that in NHs , SQCD may be a relevant work factor with substantial impact on nurses' core resources.

B	Environmental factors have been associated with psychosis but there is little qualitative research looking at how the ongoing interaction between individual and environment maintains psychotic symptoms.
P	The current study investigates how people with persecutory delusions interpret events in a virtual neutral social environment using qualitative methodology.
M	20 participants with persecutory delusions and 20 controls entered a virtual underground train containing neutral characters.
M	Under these circumstances , people with persecutory delusions reported similar levels of paranoia as non-clinical participants.
M	The transcripts of a post-virtual reality interview of the first 10 participants in each group were analysed.
R	Thematic analyses of interviews focusing on the decision making process associated with attributing intentions of computer-generated characters revealed 11 themes grouped in 3 main categories ( evidence in favour of paranoid appraisals , evidence against paranoid appraisals , other behaviour ).
C	People with current persecutory delusions are able to use a range of similar strategies to healthy volunteers when making judgements about potential threat in a neutral environment that does not elicit anxiety , but they are less likely than controls to engage in active hypothesis-testing and instead favour experiencing "affect" as evidence of persecutory intention.
B	Few studies have examined the impact of lifestyle patterns on survival following breast cancer.
B	We aimed to identify distinct lifestyle patterns based on five behavior/dietary exposures among a population -based sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer and to examine their association with subsequent survival.
M	In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phases I/II , we interviewed 1 ,808 women 20-74 years of age following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.
M	We determined vital status using the National Death Index ( 717 deaths , 427 from breast cancer ; median follow-up 13.56 years ).
M	We assessed lifestyle patterns using a latent class analysis based on five behavioral and dietary exposures: current versus never former smokers ; low versus high vegetable and fruit intake ; high and low/moderate , versus no alcohol consumption ; and no and low/moderate , versus high regular physical activity.
M	We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for all-cause mortality , and cause -specific and subdistrihution EIRs for breast cancer -specific mortality within 5 years and 13 years postdiagnosis conditional on 5 -year survival.
R	We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: healthy behavior and diet ( n = 916 ) ; healthy behavior and unhealthy diet ( n = 624 ) ; and unhealthy behavior and diet ( n = 268 ).
R	The unhealthy ( vs. healthy ) behavior and diet pattern was associated with a 13 -year conditional all -cause mortality HR of 1.4 ( 95% CI = 1.1 , 1.9 ) and with 13 -year conditional breast cancer -specific and suhdistribution HRs of 1.2 ( 95% CI = 0.79 , 1.9 ) and 1.2 ( 95% CI= 0.77 , 1.8 ) , respectively.
C	Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestyle patterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis.
B	Depression and intimate partner violence ( IPV ) are significant health issues for U. S. women.
B	Interaction effects between IPV and other psychosocial factors on the severity of depressive symptoms have not been fully explored.
B	This study assessed effect modification , that is , how IPV interacts with sociodemographics , psychosocial factors and health risk behaviors , on the severity of depressive symptoms in women.
M	We utilized cross-sectional data from female respondents ( n = 16 ,106 ) of the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey.
M	Sociodemographics , psychosocial variables , and health risk behaviors determined to be significantly associated with depression were tested for interaction effects with IPV.
M	Weighted ordinal logistic regression and predicted probabilities illustrated the effect of IPV status on depressive symptom severity , stratified by interaction effects.
R	Recent and lifetime IPV exposure were associated with more severe depressive symptoms compared with no IPV exposure.
R	IPV history interacted with employment status and social support on the severity of depressive symptoms in women.
R	Overall , any IPV exposure was associated with more severe depressive symptoms among women with low social support and unemployment , although the effect of recent ( versus lifetime ) IPV was most pronounced among women with high social support or employed women.
C	Social support and employment status interact with IPV on the severity of depressive symptoms in women.
C	Therefore , social support or workplace interventions designed to improve depressive symptoms should examine IPV history.

B	Climate change is producing major impacts including increasing temperatures in tropical countries , like Costa Rica , where the sugarcane industry employs thousands of workers who are exposed to extreme heat.
P	This article outlines a pilot qualitative evaluation of working conditions and heat in the sugarcane industry.
M	A literature review , direct observations and exploratory interviews with workers were conducted to reach a preliminary understanding of the dimensions of heat-related health issues in the sugarcane industry , as a basis for the design of future studies.
R	The industry employs temporary workers from Nicaragua and Costa Rica as well as year-round employees.
R	Temporary employees work 12-hour shifts during the harvest and processing ( 'zafra' ) season.
R	In many cases , sugarcane field workers are required to carry their own water and often have no access to shade.
R	Sugar mill workers are exposed to different levels of heat stress depending upon their job tasks , with the most intense heat and workload experienced by the oven ( 'caldera' ) cleaners.
C	Research is needed to achieve better understanding of the multiple factors driving and interacting with heat exposures in the sugarcane industry in order to improve the health and safety of workers while maintaining worker productivity.
B	Finding solutions to global health problems will require a highly-trained , inter-disciplinary workforce.
B	Global health education and research can potentially have long-range impact in addressing the global burden of disease and protecting and improving the health of the global population.
M	We conducted an online survey of twelve higher education institutions in the Pacific Rim that spanned the period 2005-2011.
M	Program administrators provided data on program concentrations , student enrollment and student funding opportunities for 41 public health programs , including those specific to global health.
R	The Master of Public Health ( MPH ) was the most common degree offered.
R	A growing demand for global health education was evident.
R	Enrollment in global health programs increased over three-fold between 2005-2011.
R	Very few institutions had specific global health programs or offered training to undergraduates.
R	Funding for student scholarships was also lacking.
C	The growing demand for global health education suggests that universities in the Pacific Rim should increase educational and training opportunities in this field.
C	Schools of medicine may not be fully equipped to teach global health-related courses and to mentor students who are interested in global health.
C	Increasing the number of dedicated global health research and training institutions in the Pacific Rim can contribute to building capacity in the region.
C	Faculty from different departments and disciplines should be engaged to provide multi-disciplinary global health educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.
C	New , innovative ways to collaborate in education , such as distance education , can also help universities offer a wider range of global health-related courses.
C	Additional funding of global health is also required.
B	A self-verification model of social anxiety views negative social self-esteem as a core feature of social anxiety.
B	This core feature is proposed to be maintained through self-verification processes , such as by leading individuals with negative social self-esteem to prefer negative social feedback.
B	This model is tested in two studies.
M	In Study 1 , questionnaires were administered to a college sample ( N = 317 ).
M	In Study 2 , questionnaires were administered to anxiety disordered patients ( N = 62 ) before and after treatment.
R	Study 1 developed measures of preference for negative social feedback and social self-esteem , and provided evidence of their incremental validity in a college sample.
R	Study 2 found that these two variables are not strongly related to fears of evaluation , are relatively unaffected by a treatment that targets such fears , and predict residual social anxiety following treatment.
C	Overall , these studies provide preliminary evidence for a self-verification model of social anxiety.
B	Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that may affect the decisional capacity , and as a consequence , preferred alternative decision-makers may be engaged to help with clinical care and research-related choices.
B	Ideally , alternative decision-makers will seek to make decisions that fit with the views and preferences of the ill individual.
B	Few data exist , however , comparing the views of alternative decision-makers to those of individuals with schizophrenia.
M	We conducted a written survey with individuals with schizophrenia living in a community setting , and a parallel survey with the person whom the ill individual identified as being a preferred alternative decision-maker.
M	Complete data were obtained on 20 pairs ( n = 40 , total ).
M	Domains queried included ( a ) burden , happiness , and safety of the ill individual and of his or her family in treatment and research decisions and ( b ) importance of ethical principles in every day life.
M	Two-sided paired t-tests and graphical summaries were used to compare responses.
R	Individuals with schizophrenia and their linked preferred alternative decision-makers were attuned on four of six aspects of treatment decision-making and on all six aspects of research decision-making that we queried.
C	The preferred alternative decision-makers overall demonstrated attunement to the views of the ill individuals in this small study.
C	Ill individuals and their preferred alternative decision-makers were aligned in their views of ethically-salient aspects of every day life.
C	These novel findings suggest that alternative decision-makers identified by ill individuals may be able to guide choices based on an accurate understanding of the ill individuals' views and values.

B	Regular physical activity is associated with quality of life and other health-related outcomes in ovarian cancer survivors , but participation rates are low.
B	This study investigated the determinants of physical activity in ovarian cancer survivors.
M	A population-based , cross-sectional , mailed survey of ovarian cancer survivors in Alberta , Canada , was conducted.
M	Measures included self-reported physical activity , medical and demographic factors , and social-cognitive variables from the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ).
R	A total of 359 women participated ( 51.4% response rate ) , of whom 112 ( 31.1% ) were meeting physical activity guidelines.
R	Variables associated with meeting guidelines were younger age , higher education and income , being employed , lower body-mass index , absence of arthritis , longer time since diagnosis , earlier disease stage , and being disease free.
R	Analysis of the TPB variables indicated that 36% of the variance in physical activity guidelines was explained , with intention being the sole independent correlate ( beta = .56 ; P < .001 ).
C	Various demographic and medical factors can help identify ovarian cancer survivors at risk for physical inactivity.
C	Interventions should attempt to increase physical activity intentions in this population by focusing on instrumental and affective attitudes , as well as perceptions of control.
P	This study examined links between diurnal patterns of the stress hormone cortisol and time spent by adolescents in nine common daily activities.
M	During eight consecutive nightly telephone interviews , 28 youths ( n = 12 girls ) , 10-18 years of age , reported their daily activities.
M	On 4 days , four saliva samples were also collected and assayed for cortisol.
M	Multilevel models assessed within-and between-person associations between time in each activity and cortisol area under the curve ( AUC ) , cortisol awakening response ( CAR ) , morning peak ( 30 minutes after wake up ) , and daily decline ( morning peak to bedtime ).
R	Links with AUC were found for most activities ; significant associations with cortisol rhythms suggested that most effects were due to anticipation of the day's activities.
R	Specifically , on days when youths when youths spent more time than usual on video games and television , they had lower AUCs , with lower morning peaks.
R	Youths who spent more time reading ( within-person ) and in computer-related activities ( between-person ) had higher AUCs , with stronger CARs ( within-person ).
R	Youths who slept more had lower AUCs , with lower morning peaks on both the between-and within-person levels.
R	Amounts of time spent in clubs , and for older adolescents in sports , were also linked to lower AUCs.
R	Finally , youths who spent more time in school/schoolwork had lower average AUCs , but on days when youths spent more time than usual in school , they had higher AUCs , stronger CARs , and steeper daily declines.
C	Beyond their known implications for psychological adjustment , youths' everyday activities are linked to stress physiology.

B	The aim of the present study was to test promising constructs ( decisional balance and drinking identity ) and their interaction with gender as predictors of risky college drinking.
B	We expected that , consistent with previous work , drinking identity would be positively associated with alcohol consumption and problems.
B	We further expected that drinking identity would be more strongly related to outcomes among individuals scoring low in decisional balance.
B	Additionally , we expect the relationship between drinking identity and alcohol behavior to vary as a function of decisional balance.
M	Participants included 329 undergraduates ( M = 23.11 ; SD = 5.63 ; 74.47% female ) who met heavy drinking criteria ( defined as women who consumed 4 or more drinks per occasion and men who consumed 5 or more drinks per occasion ) and completed an online survey comprised of self-report measures.
R	Decisional balance was negatively correlated with both drinking and problems , which partially supported expectations.
R	As expected , drinking identity was positively correlated with drinking and problems.
R	A two-way interaction emerged between drinking identity and decisional balance regarding problems , indicating that drinking identity was associated with more problems , especially among those lower in decisional balance.
R	A three-way interaction between drinking identity , decisional balance , and gender emerged regarding problems such that drinking identity was associated with more problems for those lower in decisional balance and this effect was stronger among men.
C	Findings lend support to the perspective that decisional balance , drinking identity , and gender are all influential factors that are associated with the experience of alcohol problems.

B	The observed positive effects of school-based prevention programs are frequently lower than what was expected , usually due to inadequate implementation
P	To describe the process evaluation of a cannabis use school-based prevention program ( xkpts corn ) , to measure teachers' satisfaction with the program and to define quantitative and qualitative parameters for assessing the exhaustiveness of the intervention
M	Cross-sectional descriptive study Sample 117 9th-grade classes in 39 schools ( 2812 students ) The information was gathered by means of a self-report questionnaire for teachers and families A descriptive analysis was made of the implementation of the intervention in the classrooms and of the families' participation
R	Teachers' response rate was 65% Discussion was the method most widely applied ( 100% of the classrooms ) and DVD was the most widely used material ( 93 4% ) Skills training was applied in 72 4% of the classrooms In 59 No of the classrooms there was an acceptable intervention ( at least 8 of the 16 preventive activities ) , while in 382% there was a qualified intervention ( at least 1 activity for each general lesson and 2 for each specific one ) Mean score given to the program by teachers was 74 , and 81 6% of them reported their intention to apply it again Participation rate of the students' families was 283% ( 796 )
C	The intervention was acceptable in two out of three classrooms , while in four out of ten the protocol was applied strictly Greater participation of the students' families corresponded to those schools in which the intervention was better implemented
B	The rate of caesarean section ( C-section ) in Iran is too high , so having a plan to control it is crucial.
B	Since one of the most important reasons for inclination of providers to do C-section is financial issues , the purpose of this study was offering financial solutions for increasing normal vaginal delivery ( NVD ) and decreasing non-indicated C-section.
M	This analytical-descriptive research , used game theory for offering financial mechanisms.
M	The game was a dynamic one in which the backward induction was used to obtain a Nash equilibrium.
M	Financial structure and the mean number of NVD and C-section in a certain period of time in comparison with standards were as the main influential factors on financial dimensions and were included in the model.
R	The effect of financial structure was shown through a specified insurance for childbirth , existence of a monitoring department and tariffs.
C	The main solution for controlling C-section in designed game was taxes and fines for physician or hospital in non-indicated cases and giving reward otherwise.
B	Unsafe abortion contributes to a significant portion of maternal mortality in India.
B	Access to safe abortion care is known to reduce maternal mortality.
B	Availability and distribution of abortion care facilities can influence women's access to these services , especially in rural areas.
P	To assess the availability and distribution of abortion care at facilities providing childbirth care in three districts of Madhya Pradesh ( MP ) province of India.
M	Three socio demographically heterogeneous districts of MP were selected for this study.
M	Facilities conducting at least 10 deliveries a month were surveyed to assess availability and provision of abortion services using UN signal functions for emergency obstetric care.
M	Geographical Information System was used for visualisation of the distribution of facilities.
R	The three districts had 99 facilities that conducted > 10 deliveries a month: 74 in public and 25 in private sector.
R	Overall , 48% of facilities reported an ability to provide safe surgical abortion service.
R	Of public centres , 32% reported the ability compared to 100% among private centres while 18% of public centres and 77% of private centres had performed an abortion in the last 3 months.
R	The availability of abortion services was higher at higher facility levels with better equipped and skilled personnel availability , in urban areas and in private sector facilities.
C	Findings showed that availability of safe abortion care is limited especially in rural areas.
C	More emphasis on providing safe abortion services , particularly at primary care level , is important to more significantly dent maternal mortality in India.
B	Hypertension ( HTN ) is a global public health issue.
B	Self-care is an essential component of HTN treatment , but no instruments are available with which to measure self-care of HTN.
P	The purpose of this study is to test the psychometric properties of the Self-care of Hypertension Inventory ( SC-HI ).
M	Using the Self-care of Chronic Illness theory , we developed a 24-item measure of maintenance , monitoring , and management appropriate for persons with chronic HTN , tested it for content validity , and then tested it in a convenience sample of 193 adults.
M	Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify measure structure.
M	Cronbach's alpha and factor determinacy scores and were used to assess reliability.
M	Validity was tested with the Medical Outcomes Study General Adherence Scale and the Decision Making Competency Inventory.
R	Seventy percent of the sample was female ; mean age was 56.4 +/- 13 years ; mean duration of HTN was 11 +/- 9 years.
R	Removal of 1 item on alcohol consumption resulted in a unidimensional self-care maintenance factor with acceptable structure and internal consistency ( alpha =.83 ).
R	A multidimensional self-care management factor included "consultative" and "autonomous" factors ( factor determinacy score = 0.75 ).
R	A unidimensional confidence factor captured confidence in and persistence with each aspect of self-care ( alpha =.83 ).
R	All the self-care dimensions in the final 23-item instrument were associated with treatment adherence and several with decision making.
C	These findings support the conceptual basis of self-care in patients with HTN as a process of maintenance , monitoring , and management.
C	The SC-HI confidence scale is promising as a measure of self-efficacy in self-care.
B	Competence in transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) is unrelated to traditional measures of TTE competence , such as duration of training and number of examinations performed.
B	This study aims to explore aspects of validity of an instrument for structured assessment of echocardiographic technical skills.
M	The study included 45 physicians with three different clinical levels of echocardiography competence who all scanned the same healthy male following national guidelines.
M	An expert in echocardiography ( OG ) evaluated all the recorded , de-identified TTE images blindly using the developed instrument for assessment of TTE technical skills.
M	The instrument consisted of both a global rating scale and a procedure specific checklist.
M	Two scores were calculated for each examination: A global rating score and a total checklist score.
M	OG rated ten examinations twice for intra-rater reliability , and another expert rated the same ten examinations for inter-rater reliability.
M	A small pilot study was then performed with focus on content validity.
M	This pilot study included nine physicians who scanned three patients with different pathologies as well as different technical difficulties.
R	Validity of the TTE technical skills assessment instrument was supported by a significant correlation found between level of expertise and both the global score ( Spearman 0.76 , p<0.0001 ) and the checklist score ( Spearman 0.74 , p<0.001 ).
R	Both scores were able to distinguish between the three levels of competence that were represented in the physician group.
R	Reliability was supported by acceptable inter- and intra-rater values.
R	The pilot study showed a tendency to improved scores with increasing expertise levels , suggesting that the instrument could also be used when pathologies were present.
C	We designed and developed a structured assessment instrument of echocardiographic technical skills that showed evidence of validity in terms of high correlations between test scores on a normal person and the level of physician competence , as well as acceptable inter- and intra-rater reliability scores.
C	Further studies should , however , be performed to determine the adequate number of assessments needed to ensure high content validity and reliability in a clinical setting.
B	Young people with visual impairment ( VI ) face many environmental barriers that influence physical activity.
P	The aims of the study were to assess the level of physical activity ( PA ) in students with VI , with regard to their age , gender , level of VI , body mass index and abdominal obesity ( AO ) , and to identify the percentage of study participants who did not meet the international recommendations for PA.
M	Anthropometric measurements were taken to assess the body mass index and waist-to-height ratio.
M	The PA level was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form.
M	A sample of 122 students with VI aged 15.1e22.7 years were included in the study.
R	The mean total PA was 8514.5 +/- 7201.0 Metabolic Equivalents min/week.
R	Students with normal weight and excess weight had much greater total PA scores than those who were underweight ( p < 0.05 ).
R	Students with abdominal obesity had slightly lower total PA than those without AO.
R	Blind students were engaged less in PA in most of the domains than partially-sighted students.
R	Overall , 39.3% of participants did not meet the recommendation of 75 min/week of vigorous PA , and 23.8% did not meet the recommendation of almost 150 min/week of moderate PA.
R	In total , 32.8% of participants did not meet the international recommendations of 420 min/week moderate or vigorous PA.
C	To improve the PA level of students with VI , health promotion initiatives focused on promoting PA during their school days and free time are required , based on innovative methods adjusted to their needs.

P	Expanding access to hormonal contraception may reduce the barrier created with the current prescription requirement.
P	The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of health care providers' opinions on expanding access to hormonal contraception ( oral pill , transdermal patch , vaginal ring , and injectable ) and the role of pharmacists as direct providers of this reproductive health service.
M	A voluntary , self-administered survey was distributed to participating national professional associations' physician and midlevel provider members who provide reproductive health services.
M	Outcomes of providers' opinions on expanded access to hormonal contraception in pharmacies were analyzed by provider type ( n = 482 ).
R	Almost three-quarters ( 74% ) of the 482 providers surveyed , 76% of physicians and 70% of midlevels , were supportive of expanding access for the pill , patch , and ring contraceptives to include pharmacist-initiated access.
R	Despite overall support for pharmacist-initiated access , more than 70% of respondents were concerned that expanded access would result in decreased reproductive health preventive screening.
R	Slightly fewer providers supported or were neutral towards behind-the-counter ( 65% for pill/patch/ring , 55% injectable ) and over-the-counter ( 47% for pill/patch/ring , 36% injectable ) access than for pharmacist-initiated access.
C	The majority of reproductive health providers support pharmacist-initiated access to the pill , patch , ring , and injectable contraceptives.
C	There is some support for behind-the-counter and over-the-counter access.
C	Provider concerns about lower rates of reproductive health preventive screenings and pharmacist training issues would need to be appropriately addressed along with any policy changes.

B	Developmental Coordination Disorder ( DCD ) affects the learning and performance of everyday motor skills.
B	It commonly co-occurs with other developmental disorders and a range of associated psycho-social impairments.
B	Recent evidence-based guidelines on diagnosis , assessment , and intervention provide valuable information for practitioners.
B	However these are directed primarily at German-speaking countries and focus on work with children.
P	The aim of this project was to consider the application of these guidelines in the UK and to extend them for use with adults with DCD.
M	Individuals with DCD , parents , and professionals from a wide range of disciplines were invited to two workshops to discuss and debate the guidelines , to adapt them for the UK and produce dissemination materials.
R	A working definition of DCD was agreed , minor revisions were made to the guidelines to reflect the UK context , an extension for adults was compiled and a series of leaflets was produced to disseminate this information to health and education professionals , parents , and employers.
C	This work will raise awareness of the condition across different professional groups.
C	It provides information to help those working with children and adults with DCD in the UK to assist in the process of diagnosis , assessment , and intervention.
B	Increasing longevity presents new social and medical challenges in developed countries.
B	The prevalence of frailty is of interest because of its association with health prognosis and outcomes , but so far there is no single best diagnostic tool for this entity.
B	Therefore , estimated prevalence of frailty in countries varies considerably and ranges between 5% and 58%.
B	In Israel , the nation-wide prevalence of frailty in the elderly population is presently unknown.
B	The objective of our study was to assess the rate of the frailty in elderly Israelis.
M	A post-hoc analysis based on the results of a national Health and Nutrition Survey in Israeli elderly ( MABAT Zahav ).
M	A non-direct model to estimate frailty was based on five components that were most similar to the common frailty assessment suggested by Morley et al.
M	The frailty state was then reclassified according to different explanatory variables.
R	Data collected from 1619 subjects ( F/M = 52.9/47.1% ) with an average age of 74.6 years were analyzed.
R	Estimated frailty prevalence in the elderly population was 4.9%.
R	Frail people were more likely to have a lower income , be unemployed and have a lower education level.
R	Frailty rates were higher in women , in Jews and in subjects more prone to low physical function.
C	The estimated frailty prevalence in the Israeli elderly population , while relatively low , is comparable to some of the rates suggested in the literature.
C	The factors associated with frailty in the Israeli population are in accordance with the existing literature.
C	The suggested model may be helpful in identifying frailty in Israeli elderly.
B	In the context of health care in Belgium , the psychological or psychiatric opinion of a multidisciplinary team is required in the assessment of bariatric surgery candidates.
B	In clinical practice , a wide variety of liaison psychiatry assessment methods exist.
M	On the basis of a post-operative psychiatric comorbidity case report and a literature review on "liaison psychiatry and bariatric surgery" we aim to identify opportunities for the systematization of bariatric pre-surgery psychiatric evaluation.
R	The bariatric pre-surgery evaluation must be rigorous and founded on evidence-based medicine.
R	On this basis , specific psychiatric criteria may be defined and researched in assessments.
R	The issue remains for psychiatric comorbidities that develop after surgery and for which a preventive framework should be sustained in the liaison psychiatry approach.
C	The aim of the research is to support an improved systematization of the psychological assessments of pre-operative bariatric surgery candidates.
C	We believe that systematic evaluation tools should be defined for the identification of possible absolute or relative contra-indications and that a preventive approach to post-operative psychiatric disorders should be included in this assessment
B	A prospective study was undertaken to develop an evidence-based outreach chlamydia screening program and to assess the viability and efficiency of this complementary approach to chlamydia testing within the routine operations of a primary healthcare service.
M	A primary healthcare service based in Townsville , Queensland , Australia , identified high-prevalence groups for chlamydia in the community.
M	Subsequently , a series of outreach clinics were established and conducted between August 2004 and November 2005 at a defence force unit , a university , high school leavers' festivities , a high school catering for Indigenous students , youth service programs , and backpacker accommodations.
R	All target groups were easily accessible and yielded high participation.
R	Chlamydia prevalence ranged between 5 and 15% for five of the six groups ; high school leavers had no chlamydia.
R	All participants were notified of their results and all positive cases were treated ( median treatment interval 7 days ).
R	Five of the six assessed groups were identified as viable for screening and form the basis for the ongoing outreach chlamydia screening program.
C	The present study developed an evidence-based outreach chlamydia screening program and demonstrated its viability as a complementary approach to chlamydia testing within the routine operations of the primary healthcare service , i.e. without the need for additional funding.
C	It contributes to the evidence base necessary for a viable and efficient chlamydia management program.
C	Although the presented particulars may not be directly transferable to other communities or health systems , the general two-step approach of identifying local high-risk populations and then collaborating with community groups to access these populations is.
B	Examination of the genetic structure of complex diseases by a "genomic pathway approach"-which applies stepwise model selection to sets of more than 1000 polymorphisms in studies of several hundred subjects-has recently been proposed.
B	Models constructed through extensive selection procedures may yield misleading test statistics and measures of predictive performance ; we aimed to quantify the extent Of Such problems inherent to stepwise regression on the genomic pathway scale.
M	We performed permutation analyses and data-splitting approaches using one of the datasets examined in the paper that originally Suggested this approach ( n = 536: 1195 SNPs in 22 genes ) ( Lesnick et al.
M	PLoS Genet.
M	2007 ;3:e98 ).
R	The P values for the genetic effects produced by standard testing severely overestimated file significance , resulting in our example in a standard P value of 3.5 X 10( -69 ) and a permutation P of 0.003 ( 95% confidence interval = 0.001 to 0.009 ).
R	Furthermore , the apparent validity as measured by the area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve in 90%.
R	training datasets ( 0.935 [interquartile range = 0.918-0.951] ) was extremely overoptimistic when compared with the validity estimated from the excluded 10% validation subsets ( 0.564 [0.518-0.614] ).
R	This validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was lower than for models predicting case/control Status Solely from age and sex while excluding any genetic effects ( median difference = -0.040 [95% , confidence interval = -0.049 to -0.031] ).
C	The application of stepwise model selection oil the genomic pathway scale-at least in the simple form Currently put forward-is prone to yield highly misleading results.
C	We provide pointers to some promising , alternatives.

P	The aim of this study was to review literature relevant to cohesion measurement , explore developing measurement approaches , and provide theoretical and practical recommendations for optimizing cohesion measurement.
B	Cohesion is essential for team effectiveness and performance , leading researchers to focus attention on understanding how to enhance it.
B	However , cohesion is inconsistently defined and measured , making it difficult to compare findings across studies and limiting the ability to advance science and practice.
M	We reviewed empirical research through which we uncovered specific information about cohesion's conceptualization , measurement , and relationships with performance , culminating in a set of current trends from which we provide suggestions and possible solutions to guide future efforts and help the field converge toward greater consistency.
R	Cohesion demonstrates more significant relationships with performance when conceptualized using social and task ( but not other ) dimensions and when analyses are performed at the team level.
R	Cohesion is inherently temporal , yet researchers rarely measure cohesion at multiple points during the life of a team.
R	Finally , cohesion matters in large , dynamic collectives , complicating measurement.
R	However , innovative and unobtrusive methodologies are being used , which we highlight.
C	Practitioners and researchers are encouraged to define cohesion with task and social subdimensions and to measure with behavioral and attitudinal operationalizations.
C	Individual and team-oriented items are recommended , though team-level analyses are most effective.
C	Innovative/unobtrusive methods should be further researched to enable cohesion measurement longitudinally and in large , dynamic collectives.
C	By applying our findings and conclusions , researchers and practitioners will be more likely to find consistent , reliable , and significant cohesion-to-performance relationships.
B	The adverse effects of a long duration of untreated psychosis ( DUP ) have been explored in numerous short-term studies.
B	These studies support the development of early interventions that reduce treatment delay and promote recovery.
B	However , the enduring impact of DUP is largely unknown , partly due to the paucity of prospective long-term studies.
B	Although the DUP-outcome relationship is commonly assumed to be linear , the threshold effect has not been adequately examined.
P	To explore the relationship between DUP and long-term symptomatic remission.
M	This was a prospective study of a cohort of 153 first-episode psychosis patients in Hong Kong at the 13-year follow-up.
M	The patients were categorized into short ( <= 30 days ) , medium ( 31-180 days ) and long ( >180 days ) DUP groups.
R	The long-term outcome was ascertained in 73% of the patients.
R	Nearly half of the patients ( 47% ) fulfilled the criteria for symptomatic remission.
R	The short DUP group experienced a significantly higher remission rate over the course of the illness.
R	The odds of long-term symptomatic remission was significantly reduced in the medium DUP ( by 89% ) and long DUP ( by 85% ) groups compared with the short DUP group.
R	Further analysis showed that DUP had a specific impact on negative symptom remission.
C	The findings support the threshold theory that DUP longer than 30 days adversely impacts the long-term outcome.
C	The present study is one of the few studies that confirmed the enduring impact of DUP on long-term outcomes based on well-defined criteria and adequate statistical adjustment.

B	Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the leading cause of deaths globally , with greatest premature mortality in the low-and middle-income countries ( LMIC ).
B	Many of these countries , especially in sub-Saharan Africa , have significant budget constraints.
B	The need for current evidence on which interventions offer good value for money to stem this CVD epidemic motivates this study.
M	In this systematic review , we included studies reporting full economic evaluations of individual and population-based interventions ( pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ) , for primary and secondary prevention of CVD among adults in LMIC.
M	Several medical ( PubMed , EMBASE , SCOPUS , Web of Science ) and economic ( EconLit , NHS EED ) databases and grey literature were searched.
M	Screening of studies and data extraction was done independently by two reviewers.
M	Drummond's checklist and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality rating scale were used in the quality appraisal for all studies used to inform this evidence synthesis.
R	From a pool of 4059 records , 94 full texts were read and 50 studies , which met our inclusion criteria , were retained for our narrative synthesis.
R	Most of the studies were from middle-income countries and predominantly of high quality.
R	The majority were modelled evaluations , and there was significant heterogeneity in methods.
R	Primary prevention studies dominated secondary prevention.
R	Most of the economic evaluations were performed for pharmacological interventions focusing on blood pressure , cholesterol lowering and antiplatelet aggregants.
R	The greatest majority were cost-effective.
R	Compared to individual-based interventions , population-based interventions were few and mostly targeted reduction in sodium intake and tobacco control strategies.
R	These were very cost-effective with many being cost-saving.
C	This evidence synthesis provides a contemporary update on interventions that offer good value for money in LMICs.
C	Population-based interventions especially those targeting reduction in salt intake and tobacco control are very cost-effective in LMICs with potential to generate economic gains that can be reinvested to improve health and/or other sectors.
C	While this evidence is relevant for policy across these regions , decision makers should additionally take into account other multi-sectoral perspectives , including considerations in budget impact , fairness , affordability and implementation while setting priorities for resource allocation.
B	Among numerous health benefits , sports participation has been shown to reduce the risk of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents.
B	Schools represent an ideal environment for increasing sports participation , but it is unclear how access and choice influence participation and whether characteristics of the school sports program differentially influence boys' and girls' participation.
B	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of high school athletic programs and determine the extent to which these characteristics influenced boys' and girls' sports team participation.
M	Longitudinal telephone surveys were conducted with 1244 New Hampshire and Vermont students.
M	Students self-reported their sports team participation at baseline ( elementary school ) and follow-up ( high school ).
M	High school personnel were surveyed to assess sports opportunities , which were defined for this analysis as the number of sports offered per 100 students ( i.e. , choice ) and the percent of sports offered that did not restrict the number of players ( i.e. , access ).
R	Approximately 70% of children participated on at least one sports team , including 73% of boys and 66% of girls.
R	We detected statistically significant interactions between sex and two school opportunity variables: 1 ) the number of sports offered per 100 students ( i.e. , choice ) and 2 ) the percent of sports offered that did not restrict the number of players ( i.e. , access ).
R	After controlling for children's baseline sports participation and other covariates , boys were more likely to play on at least one sports team per year if their school did not restrict participation in the most popular sports ( relative risk , RR = 1.12 , p < 0.01 ) ; in contrast , girls were more likely to play on at least one sports team per year if their school offered a wider variety of sports ( RR = 1.47 , p < 0.001 ).
C	Sports participation has previously been shown to confer a number of health benefits ; as such , school sports programs may be an important , effective , and underused target for public health efforts , including obesity prevention programs.
C	Efforts to increase physical activity among youth should consider both access and choice in school athletic programs.
C	Schools may need to use different strategies to increase sports participation in boys and girls.

B	There is a significant potential for e-health to deliver cost-effective , quality health care , and spending on e-health systems by governments and healthcare systems is increasing worldwide.
B	However , there remains a tension between the use of e-health in this way and implementation.
B	Furthermore , the large body of reviews in the e-health implementation field , often based on one particular technology , setting or health condition make it difficult to access a comprehensive and comprehensible summary of available evidence to help plan and undertake implementation.
B	This review provides an update and re-analysis of a systematic review of the e-health implementation literature culminating in a set of accessible and usable recommendations for anyone involved or interested in the implementation of e-health.
M	MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2014.
M	Studies were included if they were systematic reviews of the implementation of e-health.
M	Data from included studies were synthesised using the principles of meta-ethnography , and categorisation of the data was informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ( CFIR ).
R	Forty-four reviews mainly from North America and Europe were included.
R	A range of e-health technologies including electronic medical records and clinical decision support systems were represented.
R	Healthcare settings included primary care , secondary care and home care.
R	Factors important for implementation were identified at the levels of the following: the individual e-health technology , the outer setting , the inner setting and the individual health professionals as well as the process of implementation.
C	This systematic review of reviews provides a synthesis of the literature that both acknowledges the multi-level complexity of e-health implementation and provides an accessible and useful guide for those planning implementation.
C	New interpretations of a large amount of data across e-health systems and healthcare settings have been generated and synthesised into a set of useable recommendations for practice.
C	This review provides a further empirical test of the CFIR and identifies areas where additional research is necessary.
B	While the association between outcome expectancies and drinking is well documented , few studies have examined whether evaluations of expected outcomes ( outcome evaluations ) moderate that association.
P	The present study tested the hypotheses that outcome evaluations moderate the outcome expectancy-drinking association and that outcome expectancies mediate the association between impulsive personality and drinking.
M	College students ( N = 201 ; 55.5% female ) enrolled in a mid-sized metropolitan university completed measures assessing outcome expectancies and evaluations , alcohol consumption , and drinking-related problems.
R	Consistent with study hypotheses , expectation of negative outcomes predicted lower levels of drinking , but only when these outcomes were evaluated as highly aversive.
R	However , impulsivity was found to be a far stronger predictor of both drinking and related problems than were outcome expectancies or evaluations.
C	The association between negative expectancy and drinking was moderated by negative evaluation , such that individuals who both expected that negative outcomes were likely to occur and who judged such outcomes as highly undesirable consumed significantly fewer drinks per week.
C	Impulsivity was found to be a strong predictor of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems.
P	Physicians are encouraged to use inclusive language regarding sexuality in order to help all adolescent patients feel accepted.
P	Non-inclusive language by physicians may influence relationships with adolescent patients , especially those with still-developing sexual identities.
P	The aim of this study was to identify patterns of physicians' use of inclusive and non-inclusive language when discussing sexuality.
M	A total of 393 conversations between 393 adolescents and 49 physicians from 11 clinics located throughout the Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , area were audio recorded.
M	Conversations were coded for the use of inclusive talk ( language use that avoids the use of specific gender , sex , or sexual orientation language ) , direct non-inclusive talk ( language use that assumes the teenager is heterosexual or exclusively engages in heterosexual sexual activity ) , and indirect non-inclusive talk ( language use that frames talk heterosexually but does not pre-identify the adolescent as heterosexual ).
R	Nearly two-thirds ( 63% , 245 ) of the visits contained some sexuality talk.
R	Inclusive talk rarely occurred ( 3.3% ) while non-inclusive language was predominant ( 48.1% direct and 48.6% indirect ).
R	There were no significant differences in language use by gender , age , adolescent race , or visit length.
R	These non-significant findings suggest that all adolescents regardless of race , gender , or age are receiving non-inclusive sexuality talk from their providers.
C	Physicians are missing opportunities to create safe environments for teenagers to discuss sexuality.
C	The examples of inclusive talk from this study may provide potentially useful ways to teach providers how to begin sexuality discussions , focusing on sexual attraction or asking about friends' sexual behavior , and maintain these discussions.
B	Studies have shown that the prevalence of mental illness can vary between urban and rural locations.
B	This study extended research to the countries of the former Soviet Union ( fSU ) by assessing the association between settlement type and psychological distress and whether factors associated with psychological distress vary by settlement type.
M	Data on 18 ,000 adults aged >= 18 years from the Health in Times of Transition ( HITT ) survey undertaken in Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Moldova , Russia , and Ukraine in 2010/11 were analyzed.
M	Settlement types were country capitals , regional capitals , cities/other urban settlements , and villages.
M	Psychological distress was defined as the country-specific highest quintile of a composite score based on 11 questions.
M	Logistic regression analysis with random effects was used to examine associations.
R	In a pooled country analysis , living in a smaller urban settlement or village was associated with significantly higher odds for psychological distress compared to living in the country capital.
R	Lower social support was a strong correlate of psychological distress in all locations except capital cities.
C	The psychological distress measure has not been formally validated in the study countries.
C	Lower levels of urbanicity are associated with greater psychological distress in the fSU countries.
C	As many Western studies have linked greater urbanization to poorer mental health , this highlights the need for caution in extrapolating findings from one part of the world to others and the importance of undertaking research on the geographical correlates of mental health in different world regions.

B	With ever-increasing life expectancy globally , it is imperative to build knowledge of how older peoples' views of their own aging , considering their health-related circumstances , affect quality of life for practitioners and policy-makers alike.
B	Based on our literature review , we wanted to determine whether older adults' attitudes toward their own aging would partly mediate the effect of their health satisfaction ratings upon their quality of life.
B	Furthermore , would these attitudes mediate the relationship between health satisfaction and quality of life in the same way when we account for older adults' country of origin , and their age and gender?
M	This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected in 20 countries taking part in the 2003 WHOQOL-OLD Field study.
M	The study sample consisted of 4593 adults whom were , on average , 72.10 years of age ( range = 60 to 100 years of age ) ; 42.8% were female.
M	The WHOQOL-BREF measured quality of life and health satisfaction.
M	The Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire measured participants' attitudes toward physical change , psychosocial loss , and psychological growth.
M	All items in both questionnaires were measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
M	Questionnaire responses were analyzed using multilevel modeling and path analysis.
R	All three attitudes to aging partly mediated the relationship between health satisfaction and physical , psychological , social , environmental , and global quality of life.
R	These partial mediations manifested in the same way across all 20 country samples , regardless of age or gender.
R	Attitudes toward physical change were the strongest mediator of health satisfaction upon global and domain-specific quality of life , followed by psychosocial loss and psychosocial growth.
C	Our study is the first cross-cultural study with a large sample to show that quality of life judgements , between 60 to 100 years of age , are a product of older men's and women's perceptions of health-related circumstances , and attitudes toward physical and psychosocial aspects of the aging self.
C	A prospective study of the linkages between older peoples' subjective views of health and attitudes toward the aging self over time using multiple subjective measures of health is warranted.
C	Understanding these linkages may help practitioners and policy makers consider strategies to enhance quality of life.
B	Nonverbal communication abilities , including gesture use , are impaired in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ).
B	However , little is known about how common gestures may influence or be influenced by other areas of development.
P	To examine the relationships between gesture , fine motor and language in young children with ASD compared with a comparison group using multiple measures and methods in a structural equation modelling framework.
M	Participants included 110 children with ASD and a non-ASD comparison group of 87 children ( that included children with developmental delays ( DD ) or typical development ( TD ) ) , from 12 to 48 months of age.
M	A construct of gesture use as measured by the Communication and Symbolic Behavior ScalesDevelopmental Profile Caregiver Questionnaire ( CQ ) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) , as well as fine motor from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior ScalesII ( VABS-II ) was examined using second-order confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ).
M	A series of structural equation models then examined concurrent relationships between the aforementioned latent gesture construct and expressive and receptive language.
M	A series of hierarchical regression analyses was run in a subsample of 36 children with ASD with longitudinal data to determine how gesture factor scores predicted later language outcomes.
R	Across study groups , the gesture CFA model with indicators of gesture use from both the CQ ( parent-reported ) and ADOS ( direct observation ) , and measures of fine motor provided good fit with all indicators significantly and strongly loading onto one gesture factor.
R	This model of gesture use , controlling for age , was found to correlate strongly with concurrent expressive and receptive language.
R	The correlations between gestures and concurrent language were similar in magnitude in both the ASD and non-ASD groups.
R	In the longitudinal subsample of children with ASD , gestures at time 1 predicted later receptive ( but not expressive ) language outcomes on the VABS-II , after controlling for nonverbal cognition , ASD severity , age and time 1 language.
C	This study extends research on the relationship between nonverbal communication and language by supporting the idea of an underlying construct of gesture use that includes fine motor ability and relates to language in young children with ASD.
C	This further supports theories espousing developmental influences of motor and nonverbal communication strategies as important in early language learning.
B	Descriptive epidemiological study has shown that drowning is a problem health in low and middle income countries.
B	To analyze records of drowning deaths from two injury registry systems , to ascertain a true estimate of drowning-mortality , it can help to follow up drowning prevention policy.
M	This study uses capture-recapture methods to arrive at a more accurate estimate of the number of drowning events occurring over a one-year period in Guilan and Mazandran Provinces , in northern Iran.
M	Records from the Iran's Forensic Medical System and Death Registry System were compared , using five matching approaches based on various combinations of the following variables: gender , place of drowning , date of death , victim age , name , region of residence , and/or place of residence.
R	The results revealed that the estimated number of drowning cases in the study population is much higher than official figures , ranging from 5.26 to 8.25 per 100 ,000 residents compared to the national figure of 4.5 per 100 ,000.
R	The completeness of Death Registry System records for drowning was 70% of corrected estimates while the completeness of records from Forensic Medicine was 54.4%.
C	We conclude that the use of capture-recapture methodology may provide better accuracy in measuring drowning events.
C	This method may also help reduce bias in the estimate of incidence rates and comparison of different populations.

B	Most research focusing on marital status and sexual risk has compared married and single mid-adult women without differentiating single women by their ever married status.
B	We elucidate differences in sexual risk among divorced and never married women.
M	Data from the National Survey of Family Growth ( NSFG ) ( n = 5 ,081 ) were analyzed to compare divorced and never married women in terms of recent and lifetime sex partners , condom use at last vaginal sex , and other sexual risk behaviors.
R	Overall , 13.1% of the women were currently divorced or separated , 62.1% were currently married , 8.3% were cohabitating , and 16.4% were never married.
R	Divorced/separated women were more likely to report 5 or more lifetime sex partners and 2 or more sex partners in the past year than never married women.
R	They were less likely to report condom use.
C	Current findings expose sexual behavioral discrepancies within the single category of women and the need to redefine risk groups for surveillance and intervention efforts.
P	To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nutritional support compared with standard care in preventing pressure ulcers ( PrUs ) in high-risk hospitalized patients.
M	An economic model using data from a systematic literature review.
M	A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of nutritional support in reducing the incidence of PrUs was conducted.
M	Modeled cohort of hospitalized patients at high risk of developing PrUs and malnutrition simulated during their hospital stay and up to 1 year.
M	INTERVENTIONS: Standard care included PrU prevention strategies , such as redistribution surfaces , repositioning , and skin protection strategies , along with standard hospital diet.
M	In addition to the standard care , the intervention group received nutritional support comprising patient education , nutrition goal setting , and the consumption of high-protein supplements.
M	MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The analysis was from a healthcare payer perspective.
M	Key outcomes of the model included the average costs and quality-adjusted life years.
M	Model results were tested in univariate sensitivity analyses , and decision uncertainty was characterized using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
R	Compared with standard care , nutritional support was cost saving at AU $425 per patient and marginally more effective with an average 0.005 quality-adjusted life years gained.
R	The probability of nutritional support being cost-effective was 87%.
C	Nutritional support to prevent PrUs in high-risk hospitalized patients is cost-effective with substantial cost savings predicted.
C	Hospitals should implement the recommendations from the current PrU practice guidelines and offer nutritional support to high-risk patients.
B	Bipolar I disorder ( BPD ) patients are often overweight or obese , and likely to have metabolic syndrome.
B	Several medications used to treat BPD are associated with increased body weight and/or worsening metabolic parameters.
M	Metabolic data were analyzed from two efficacy studies of aripiprazole plus the mood stabilizers , lithium/valproate ( Study CN138-189 ) , or lamotrigine ( Study CN138-392 ) , in the long-term treatment ( 52 weeks ) of BPD.
M	Changes in body weight , individual metabolic parameters , and incidence of metabolic syndrome were assessed.
R	In the lithium/valproate study , modest increases in body weight were observed at Week 52 in both groups: 1.7 +/- 0.8 kg in the lithium/valproate group , and 1.6 +/- 0.7 kg in the adjunctive aripiprazole group ; this difference was nonsignificant.
R	In the lamotrigine study , decreases in body weight were observed at Week 52 with lamotrigine alone (  2.2 +/- 1.0 kg ) , whereas a modest increase was observed when combined with aripiprazole ( 0.4 +/- 1.0 kg ).
R	In both studies , rates of metabolic syndrome at 52 weeks did not increase from baseline with aripiprazole , and median changes from baseline in individual metabolic syndrome parameters were similar with both mood stabilizer monotherapy and the addition of aripiprazole as an adjunctive therapy.
C	This was a post-hoc analysis , and a low percentage of patients completed the lamotrigine study.
C	Aripiprazole plus a mood stabilizer has minimal impact on metabolic changes in predominantly overweight/obese BPD patients over a 52-week period.
C	In both studies , modest mean increases in weight with the addition of aripiprazole were not accompanied by increased rates of metabolic syndrome or changes in metabolic parameters.

B	The literature points to possible efficiencies in local-hospital-system performance , but little is known about the internal dynamics that might contribute to this.
B	Study of the service arrangements that nearby same-system hospitals have with one another should provide clues into how system efficiencies might be attained.
P	The purpose of this research was to better understand the financial and operational effects of service sharing and receiving arrangements among nearby hospitals belonging to the same systems.
M	Data are compiled for the 1 ,227 U.S. urban acute care hospitals that belong to multihospital systems.
M	A longitudinal structural equation model is employed-environmental pressures and organizational characteristics in 1997 are associated with service sharing and receiving arrangements in 2000 ; service sharing and receiving arrangements are then associated with performance in 2003.
M	Service sharing and receiving are measured by counts of services focal hospitals report that are not duplicated by other-system hospitals within the same county.
M	Linear Structural Relations ( LISREL ) is used to estimate the model.
R	In general , market competition from managed care and hospitals influences hospitals to exchange services.
R	For individual hospitals , service sharing has no effects on operational efficiency and financial performance.
R	Service receiving , however , is related to greater efficiencies and higher profits.
C	The findings underscore the asymmetrical relationships that exist among local-system hospitals.
C	individual hospitals benefit from service receiving arrangements but not from sharing arrangements-it is better to receive than to give.
C	To the extent that individual hospitals independently determine service capacities , systems may not be able to effectively rationalize service offerings.
P	This investigation was designed to provide a quantification and synthesis of a series of single-case experimental design investigations into the effects of sound production treatment , an articulatory-kinematic treatment for acquired apraxia of speech ( AOS ).
P	The main purpose was to perform a meta-analysis of aggregated sound production treatment data in order to provide benchmarks to serve as indicators of magnitude of change.
P	Additional analyses explored various factors influencing effect sizes and level of performance.
M	Effect sizes were calculated for treated and untreated items for 24 participants across 10 investigations.
M	Benchmarks were calculated as the quartiles of the distributions of the effect sizes.
M	Correlational analyses were performed to examine ( a ) end-of-treatment performance relative to follow-up performance , ( b ) response of trained items relative to untrained items , and ( c ) effect size relative to participant variables.
R	Effect sizes were predominantly large and positive ; benchmarks for treated items were larger than those for untreated items.
R	End of treatment and follow-up performance were positively correlated , and response generalization was positively correlated with AOS severity.
C	These benchmarks may assist in evaluating the effects of interventions for individuals with AOS utilizing similar outcome measures in both clinical and research settings.
B	In 2008 UK legislation was amended to enable the use of deferred consent for paediatric emergency care ( EC ) trials in recognition of the practical and ethical difficulties of obtaining prospective consent in an emergency situation.
B	However , ambiguity about how to make deferred consent acceptable to parents , children and practitioners remains.
B	In particular , little is known about practitioners' views and experiences of seeking deferred consent in this setting.
M	As part of a wider study investigating consent methods in paediatric emergency care trials ( called CONNECT ) , a 20 item online questionnaire was sent by email inviting practitioners ( doctors and nurses ) who were involved in talking with families about children's and young people's ( aged 0-16 years ) participation in UK EC trials.
M	To ensure those with and without experience of deferred consent were included , practitioners were sampled using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods.
M	Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data , whilst the constant comparative method was used to analyse qualitative data.
M	Elements of a symbiotic empirical ethics approach was used to integrate empirical evidence and bioethical literature to explore the data and draw practice orientated conclusions.
R	Views on deferred consent differed depending upon whether or not practitioners were experienced in this consent method.
R	Practitioners who had no experience of deferred consent reported negative perceptions of this consent method ; these practitioners were concerned about the impact that deferred consent would have upon the parent-practitioner relationship.
R	In contrast , practitioners experienced in deferred consent described how families had been receptive to the consent method , if conducted sensitively and in a time appropriate manner.
R	Experienced practitioners also described how deferred consent had improved recruitment , parental decision-making capacity and parent-practitioner relationships in the emergency care setting.
C	The views of practitioners with first-hand experience of deferred consent should be considered in the design and ethical review of future paediatric EC trials ; the design and ethical review of such trials should not solely be informed by the beliefs of those without experience of using deferred consent.
C	Further research involving parents and children is required to inform practitioner training and normative guidance on the use and appropriateness of deferred consent in emergency settings.
P	This study examined the extent to which teacher responsivity education affected preschoolers' language and literacy development over an academic year.
P	Additional aims were to determine whether children's initial language abilities and teachers' use of responsivity strategies were associated with language outcomes , in particular.
M	In this randomized controlled trial , preschool centers were assigned to a responsivity education intervention ( n = 19 centers , 25 teachers , and 174 children ) or a "business-as-usual" control condition ( n = 19 centers , 24 teachers , and 156 children ).
M	Teachers within the intervention centers received training focused on a set of strategies designed to promote children's engagement and participation in extended conversational interactions across the school day.
R	Hierarchical linear models showed no main effects on children's language skills , although moderating effects were observed such that the intervention appeared to have positive effects for children with relatively high initial language abilities.
R	In addition , teacher use of responsivity strategies was positively associated with vocabulary development.
R	With regard to children's literacy skills , there was a significant main effect of the intervention on print-concept knowledge.
C	Although teacher responsivity education is viewed as benefitting children's language and literacy development , the impacts of this type of intervention on children's skills warrant further investigation.
P	Immobilization and adequate surface contact to wounds are critical for skin graft take.
P	Techniques such as the tie-over dressing , cotton bolster , and vacuum-assisted closure are used to address this , but each has its limitations.
P	This study is designed to assess the effect of antimicrobial-impregnated dressing ( AMD ) combined with negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) on skin graft survival.
M	Retrospective case-control study
M	Patients with chronic or contaminated wounds treated with split-thickness skin graft.
M	A broad spectrum of wounds was included , from causes such as trauma , burns , chronic diabetic ulcers , and infection.
M	INTERVENTIONS: Antimicrobial-impregnated dressing , which contains 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide , with NPWT MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Success of skin graft
R	In the AMD group , all skin grafts achieved 100% take without secondary intervention.
R	No infection or graft failure was observed in any patients , and no complications , such as hematoma or seroma formation , were noted , although in the control group partial loss of skin grafts was noted in 3 patients.
R	Infection and inadequate immobilization were thought to be the main reasons.
R	There were no hematoma or seroma formations in the control group.
C	Use of an AMD dressing with NPWT after split-thickness skin grafting can be an effective method to ensure good graft to wound contact and enhances skin graft take in chronic and contaminated wounds.
B	With a view to addressing the moral concerns about the use of donor siblings , the Policy Statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics - Children as Hematopoietic Stem Cell Donors ( the Policy ) has laid out the criteria upon which tissue harvest from a minor would be permissible.
C	Although tissue harvest serves the best interests of recipient siblings , parents are also obliged to act in the best interests of the donor sibling in the UK.
C	Tissue harvest should proceed if and only if it serves the best interests of both the donor and recipient.
C	Parents should be forbidden , and they are by UK law , to consent to tissue harvest unless there are substantial benefits for an incompetent minor that can outweigh the potential harm.
C	There is no basis to subject a minor to the medical risks of tissue harvest if the recipient sibling can wait without significant risks of complications until the donor becomes Gillick competent.
C	We also argue that the Policy fails to take into account recent advances in haematopoietic transplantation from haploidentical donors or related tissue-matched donors.
C	Unless a recipient sibling will suffer from serious complications or die without the transplantation and no other medically equivalent donors are available , there is no moral or legal basis to violate the donor sibling's right to bodily integrity.
C	Accordingly , we propose that the Policy should be modified in order to fully satisfy the legal requirements for application in the UK and other commonwealth jurisdictions with similar statute laws protecting minors.
B	This article presents the extent to which providers enrolled in California's Family Planning , Access , Care , and Treatment ( Family PACT ) program offer contraceptive methods onsite , thus eliminating one important access barrier.
B	Family PACT has a diverse provider network , including public-sector providers receiving Title X funding , public-sector providers not receiving Title X funding , and private-sector providers.
B	We explored whether Title X funding enhances providers' ability to offer contraceptive methods that require specialized skills onsite.
M	Data were derived from 1 ,072 survey responses to a 2010 provider-capacity survey matched by unique identifier to administrative claims data.
R	A significantly greater proportion of Title X-funded providers compared to non-Title X public and private providers offered onsite services for the following studied methods: intrauterine contraceptives ( 90% Title X , 51% public non-Title X , 38% private ) ; contraceptive implants ( 58% Title X , 19% public non-Title X , 7% private ) ; vasectomy ( 8% Title X , 4% public non-Title X , 1% private ) ; and fertility-awareness methods ( 69% Title X , 55% public non-Title X , 49% private ) ( all p<0.0001 ).
R	The association between onsite provision and Title X funding remained after stratifying individually by clinic specialty , facility capacity to provide reproductive health services ( based on staffing ) , and rural/urban location.
C	Extra funding for publicly funded family-planning programs , through mechanisms such as Title X , appears to be associated with increased onsite access to a wide range of contraceptive services , including those that require special skills and training.
B	Previous growth references for Norwegian children were based on measurements from the 1970s and 1980s.
B	New reference data , collected through the Bergen Growth Study and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway , are presented as LMS values.
M	A cross-sectional sample of children aged 0-19 years in stratified randomized design measured in 2003-2006 as a part of the Bergen Growth Study ( n = 7291 ) and birth data of children born in 1999-2003 from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway ( n = 12 576 ) was used to estimate the new references by the means of the LMS method.
M	Measurement reliability was assessed by test-rest studies.
R	New references were constructed for length/height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) and head circumference.
R	Length/height and weight for children aged 0-4 years were similar to previous Norwegian references , but mean height increased up to a maximum of 3.4 cm in boys and 2.5 cm in girls during the pubertal years.
R	Mean height was similar to ( or slightly higher ) in comparison with other recent European references.
R	Reliability of the measurements compared well with published estimates.
C	Because of the observed secular trends in growth , it is advised to use the new references , which have been endorsed by the Norwegian Department of Health.
B	Little research or policy guidance about the involvement of mental health service users in risk assessment exists.
P	To explore how mental health professionals assessed risk to others and the extent to which they involved service users.
P	To ascertain service users' knowledge of , and involvement in , risk assessment.
M	Qualitative research methodology was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with mental health services users and professionals.
R	Four key themes arose ( i ) some professionals lacked confidence or experience in discussing risk openly with service users , ( ii ) most were not involving service users in risk assessments , ( iii ) the majority of service users were unaware that professionals were undertaking risk assessments on them , and ( iv ) there were differing levels of agreement between professionals and service users about risk and its seriousness.
C	There is a research and practice gap about effective means of engaging service users in risk assessment.
C	Declaration of interest: The original study upon which this paper is based was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
B	Low serum cholesterol has been linked to suicide and violent behaviour.
B	The same kind of associations has been reported regarding low levels of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) and suicidal behaviour.
B	The hypothesis of the link between serum cholesterol and suicide incorporate serotonin.
B	It proposes that low cholesterol is related to altered serotonergic neurotransmission.
B	A correlation between CSF 5-HIAA and serum cholesterol has been shown in animal studies , but has not been found in humans.
P	To study the interrelationship between serum cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA in suicide attempters.
P	Since both cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA are associated with suicide and violent suicide attempts , we also investigated the correlation with suicide , violent suicide attempt method , suicide intent , hopelessness and depression severity.
M	Serum total cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA were measured in 42 medication free suicide attempters.
M	Patients were assessed with Becks's Hopelessness scale ( BHS ) , Suicide Intent Scale ( SIS ) and Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale ( MADRS ) and followed-up for causes of death.
R	Serum total cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA showed a significant positive correlation adjusted for age , body mass index and substance abuse diagnosis.
R	Cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA levels did not differ between violent and non-violent suicide attempters or between suicide completers and survivors.
C	These findings indicate that the serotonergic system may be connected to serum cholesterol in patients with a recent suicide attempt.

B	To improve management of severely ill hospitalized patients in low-income settings , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) established a triage tool called "Quick Check" to provide clinicians with a rapid , standardized approach to identify patients with severe illness based on recognition of abnormal vital signs.
B	Despite the availability of these guidelines , recognition of severe illness remains challenged in low-income settings , largely as a result of infrequent vital sign monitoring.
M	We conducted a staggered , pre-post quasi-experimental study at four inpatient health facilities in western Uganda to assess the impact of a multi-modal intervention for improving quality of care following formal training on WHO "Quick Check" guidelines for diagnosis of severe illness in low-income settings.
M	Intervention components were developed using the COM-B ( "capability ," "opportunity ," and "motivation" determine "behavior" ) model and included clinical mentoring by an expert in severe illness care , collaborative improvement meetings with external support supervision , and continuous audits of clinical performance with structured feedback.
R	There were 5759 patients hospitalized from August 2014 to May 2015: 1633 were admitted before and 4126 during the intervention period.
R	Designed to occur twice monthly , collaborative improvement meetings occurred every 2-4 weeks at each site.
R	Clinical mentoring sessions , designed to occur monthly , occurred every 4-6 months at each site.
R	Audit and feedback reports were implemented weekly as designed.
R	During the intervention period , there were significant increases in the site-adjusted likelihood of initial assessment of temperature , heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , mental status , and pulse oximetry.
R	Patients admitted during the intervention period were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with sepsis ( 4.3 vs. 0.4% , risk ratio 10.1 , 95% CI 3.0-31.0 , p < 0.001 ) and severe respiratory distress ( 3.9 vs. 0.9% , risk ratio 4.5 , 95% CI 1.8-10.9 , p = 0.001 ).
C	Theory-informed quality improvement programs can improve vital sign collection and diagnosis of severe illness in low-income settings.
C	Further implementation , evaluation , and scale-up of such interventions are needed to enhance hospital-based triage and severe illness management in these settings.
P	The evidence base to support therapeutic exercise for people with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is improving ; however few studies have considered the patients' perspective.
P	This study aimed to explore the experiences and views of people moderately affected with MS following participation in a 12-week exercise programme.
M	Twenty people with MS participated in a group exercise class.
M	Subsequently , four men and ten women took part in one of two focus groups.
M	Semi-structured questions were used to elicit participants' views on the exercise class , outcomes from exercise and the exercise class and any perceived facilitators or barriers to exercise.
M	Data were analysed using a general inductive method.
R	Benefits to participating in exercise for those with MS included social support and symptom improvement.
R	Psychosocial factors , symptoms and lack of service emerged as exercise barriers.
R	Three inter-related themes emerged ; ( 1 ) The exercise class developed as a bridge to allow participants to realise , ( 2 ) the benefits of the class , helping them to overcome and ( 3 ) barriers to exercise.
C	Taking part in an exercise class was a positive experience for people with MS. Healthcare professionals should work with exercise professionals to provide feasible exercise opportunities to help those with MS benefit from therapeutic exercise.
B	The population of individuals with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) in Korea is increasing rapidly , yet comprehensive research on the quality of life ( QOL ) of this population undergoing hemodialysis is scarce.
P	The purpose of this study was to identify the factors influencing QOL of Korean hemodialysis patients with ESRD.
M	This study was a cross-sectional survey.
M	Data were drawn from a convenience sample of 141 patients aged >18 years receiving maintenance hemodialysis in a general hospital.
M	Data were collected by a self-administrated survey conducted from June 15 to July 25 , 2012.
M	The questionnaire included basic subject data , QOL , fatigue , perceived health status , and emotional status.
R	The mean QOL score was 3.09 or "above average" as measured by the World Health Organization's ( 1993 ) Quality of Life Assessment.
R	Significant differences were observed for basic subject data including educational level , occupation , monthly income , medical expense assistance , and family living situation.
R	Significant negative correlations were found between QOL and fatigue and between anxiety and depression , but a significant positive correlation was found with perceived health status.
R	The factors influencing QOL were fatigue and depression , marital status ( married ) , and medical expense assistance ( from self or parents ).
C	The results of this study indicate that , to improve the QOL in patients with ESRD , comprehensive intervention is necessary to assess and manage depression and fatigue.
C	Social mediation is needed to enhance the QOL of patients with ESRD who lack familial and economic support , those who are single , or those who cannot afford medical expenses either by themselves or with the help of their parents.
B	Previous literature revealed that cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy commonly experience physical and psychological symptom distress.
B	Except lack of medical information , inadequate communication with physicians also affected patients' willingness and preparation toward radiotherapy.
B	The prognosis consequently becomes worse.
P	This study aimed to evaluate the change in symptom distress in cancer patients after radiotherapy and its predisposing factors.
M	A longitudinal design was conducted on 164 cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy at a medical center in southern Taiwan.
M	The structured questionnaire included sections on demographics , medical conditions , and a symptom distress scale.
R	Of the cancer patients , 35.9% reported an increase in the overall figures of symptom distress after radiotherapy , whereas 32.2% experienced a decrease.
R	Cancer patients 20 to 39 years old or who received radiotherapy on the head and neck reported the greatest increase in bleeding and the overall figure of symptom distress.
R	Patients after radiotherapy on the head and neck experienced significant increase in bowel disturbance.
C	Radiotherapy did not necessarily increase symptom distress in all patients.
C	The development of bleeding and the overall figure of symptom distress were closely related to younger age and site of radiotherapy.
C	For those cancer patients 20 to 39 years old or who received radiotherapy on the head and neck , nurses may strengthen health education before radiotherapy and pay more attention after radiotherapy , especially in bleeding distress , and remind their families of the correct steps for nursing a wound after radiotherapy and the harmful effects of wound odor on patients' interpersonal relations.
B	Publications and discussions of survey research in empirical bioethics have steadily increased over the past two decades.
B	However , findings often differ among studies with similar research questions.
B	As a consequence , ethical reasoning that considers only parts of the existing literature and does not apply systematic reviews tends to be biased.
B	To date , we lack a systematic review ( SR ) methodology that takes into account the specific conceptual and practical challenges of empirical bioethics.
M	The steps of systematically reviewing empirical findings in bioethics are presented and critically discussed.
M	In particular , ( a ) the limitations of traditional SR methodologies in the field of empirical bioethics are critically discussed , and ( b ) conceptual and practical recommendations for SRs in empirical bioethics that are ( c ) based on the authors' review experiences in healthcare ethics are presented.
R	A 7-step approach for SRs of empirical bioethics is proposed: ( 1 ) careful definition of review question ; ( 2 ) selection of relevant databases ; ( 3 ) application of ancillary search strategies ; ( 4 ) development of search algorithms ; ( 5 ) relevance assessment of the retrieved references ; ( 6 ) quality assessment of included studies ; and ( 7 ) data analysis and presentation.
R	Conceptual and practical challenges arise because of various peculiarities in reviewing empirical bioethics literature and can lead to biased results if they are not taken into account.
C	If suitably adapted to the peculiarities of the field , SRs of empirical bioethics provide transparent information for ethical reasoning and decision-making that is less biased than single studies.
B	Mapping from health status measures onto generic preference-based measures is becoming a common solution when health state utility values are not directly available for economic evaluation.
B	However the accuracy and reliability of the models employed is largely untested , and there is little evidence of their suitability in patient datasets.
B	This paper examines whether mapping approaches are reliable and accurate in terms of their predictions for a large and varied UK patient dataset.
M	SF-36 dimension scores are mapped onto the EQ-5D index using a number of different model specifications.
M	The predicted EQ-5D scores for subsets of the sample are compared across inpatient and outpatient settings and medical conditions.
M	This paper compares the results to those obtained from existing mapping functions.
R	The model including SF-36 dimensions , squared and interaction terms estimated using random effects GLS has the most accurate predictions of all models estimated here and existing mapping functions as indicated by MAE ( 0.127 ) and MSE ( 0.030 ).
R	Mean absolute error in predictions by EQ-5D utility range increases with severity for our models ( 0.085 to 0.34 ) and for existing mapping functions ( 0.123 to 0.272 ).
C	Our results suggest that models mapping the SF-36 onto the EQ-5D have similar predictions across inpatient and outpatient setting and medical conditions.
C	However , the models overpredict for more severe EQ-5D states ; this problem is also present in the existing mapping functions.
P	The aim of this study was to identify atherosclerotic risk using pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) in steel workers employed in different shift-work rotations , and to elucidate its relationship to social jetlag and shift schedule details.
M	Male workers in a steel factory ( n = 77 , 32 fast clockwise ( CW ) , 30 slow counterclockwise ( CC ) , 15 day workers ( DW ) ; mean age 42 +/- SD 7.6 yrs ) with at least 5 years of experience in their current work schedule participated.
M	All workers completed questionnaires on demographics , health , psychotropic agents , sleep , social and work life , social jetlag ( difference between mid-sleep time on workdays and days off used as a marker of circadian disruption ) and chronotype ( mid-sleep time on free days corrected for sleep deficit on workdays ).
M	In 63 workers we measured PWV , blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) between 08: 00 and 12: 30 h in controlled posture conditions ( no caffeine/smoking/exercise ).
R	There was no significant difference in PWV ( covariates: age , BP ) between the different shift-rotations ( CW , CC and DW ).
R	In all workers combined , HR and social jetlag were significantly positively correlated.
R	Demographic variables did not differ between shift-workers and day workers ; shift-workers ( CW , CC ) reported significantly more stomach upsets , digestion problems , weight fluctuations , and social jetlag.
R	The CW and CC workers did not differ in ratings of how shift-work affected sleep , social and work life.
C	PWV was not different between the two shift-rotations.
C	This pilot study shows first evidence that HR is related to social jetlag , and therefore warrants more studies in different shift schedules.
B	Depressive disorders are known to be associated with higher risks of cardiovascular diseases.
B	Several studies have reported an imbalance within the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) as one putative cause.
B	Previous investigations showed decreased cardio-respiratory coupling in depressive patients that were treated with nortriptyline.
B	We aimed to compare parameters of heart rate variability and cardio-respiratory coupling between unmedicated patients suffering from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and healthy controls in order to further understand autonomic dysfunction in the disease.
M	We investigated eighteen unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder and eighteen matched healthy controls.
M	Electrocardiogram and respiratory signals were obtained during a twenty minute resting period.
M	Time- and frequency based parameters of HRV , respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) , approximate entropy of heart rate ( ApEn( RR ) ) and respiratory rate ( ApEn( Resp ) ) were calculated.
M	Additionally , cross-ApEn between RR-intervals and respiration time series was determined , reflecting coupling of both signals.
R	Patients showed an increased heart rate and LF/HF-ratio.
R	Respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) and ApEn( RR ) were reduced in patients in comparison to controls.
R	Breathing rate , ApEn( Resp ) and cross-ApEn did not differ between the two groups.
C	Increased heart rate , increased LF/HF-ratio , reduced RSA and reduced ApEn( RR ) indicate a decrease of cardiac vagal modulation in depressive patients.
C	No difference of cardiorespiratory coupling was observed.
C	Respiratory parameters and cross-ApEn did not differ between both groups , and thus we conclude that diminished vagal modulation is mainly limited to cardiac modulation.

P	To describe the occurrence and perceived stress of major life events , and to investigate whether adjusting for socioeconomic status reduced race/ethnicity differences.
M	Black ( n = 639 ) and white ( n = 419 ) women aged 35-49 years responded to 14 major life event questions within the domains of employment , health , relationship , finance , residential change , and crime.
R	The total number of life events did not differ by race/ethnicity , but black women reported significantly more events in the domains of relationship , financial , and residential change than white women.
R	White women generally reported higher stress for a given event than black women , although for "residential change'' black women reported more severe stress than the white women.
C	Inclusion of both the occurrence and perceived stress of major life events can improve our understanding of how this stressor may affect health.
B	Substance use disorders ( SUDs ) are a public health problem affecting millions of Americans.
B	Despite their prevalence , there are few health care resources allocated for SUDs treatment.
B	Relatively few health care professionals are exposed to SUDs education in their respective programs , which may be one reason for this resource insufficiency.
B	In hopes of rectifying this gap , the authors developed a SUDs course for health professions students combining classroom learning with practical application to patient care.
M	The authors used Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive , affective , and psychomotor learning domains as an educational framework to create numerous opportunities for students to deepen their knowledge , assess their attitudes , and develop their motivational interviewing skills.
M	The primary outcome of the study was a comparison of students' scores on the Substance Abuse Attitude Scale ( SAAS ) pre- and post-course completion.
M	Secondary outcome was to compare students' self-assessment scores of their patient counseling with residents' assessments of them on the Liverpool Communication Skills Assessment Scale ( LCSAS ).
R	One hundred twelve students participated in the authors' SUDs course over a 9-month period.
R	Ninety-five students completed both the pre- and post-course SAAS surveys.
R	The total SAAS survey score and individual domain scores for nonmoralizing , treatment optimism , and treatment intervention demonstrated significant improvement post-course.
R	Eighty-nine students completed a motivational interview with a patient.
R	Eighty students had a LCSAS self-assessment paired with a residents' assessment.
R	Mean scores for individual items on the LCSAS for both groups' assessment were approximately 3.5 , indicating that students' communication was assessed as "acceptable" to "good."
C	This study demonstrates that Bloom's taxonomy was a useful educational framework to ensure a systematic development of the authors' SUDs course.
C	Through participation in our course , students touched each of the 3 domains in Bloom's taxonomy.
C	The authors believe their course design may serve as a framework for future SUDs courses.
B	Research on the increasing use of mobile technology in the addiction field is mainly focused on data collection and brief interventions.
B	The acceptance and outcomes of autonomous self-tracking and self-governance as key elements for behavior change are under-researched.
B	Purpose/
P	The objective of the study was to conduct a quality assessment of design and content features of self-tracking smartphone applications related to alcohol use , available in German , Italian , or French.
M	A total of 25 self-tracking applications were identified , of which 17 could be assessed with the Mobile App Rating Scale ( MARS ) , the System Usability Scale ( SUS ) , and an additional content quality checklist based on the theoretical self-change framework ( n = 13 ).
R	The scale design analysis showed a rather positive picture.
R	Using the SUS , only six cases were below the reference average ( x = 68 ) , and three were clearly above average.
R	Application of the MARS showed higher scores among the self-tracking applications in this study than among the health applications reviewed in the original MARS study.
R	Better design quality goes together with better basic content quality.
R	However , a closer look at the "interactivity scores" and the "risk/information barometer ," as well as at the individual subtopics of the 10-point content checklist revealed major shortcomings.
C	Improvements are necessary for consumer information in app stores , increased availability of alcohol-related self-tracking applications , transparent quality assurance regarding evidence-based content , and user-friendly design quality , to provide guidance for potential users on how to successfully navigate a highly unstable digital environment.
B	A substantial literature has reported that stress negatively impacts on cognitive processes.
B	As dementia caregiving can be stressful , it has been hypothesized that the challenges of dementia care may increase caregivers' own vulnerability to cognitive decline.
B	Prefrontal processes are thought to be most vulnerable to stress ; however , few studies have examined whether greater caregiver stress predicts poorer executive dysfunction , and no previous research has considered potential moderators of this relationship.
B	We examined ( 1 ) whether greater psychological stress mediated a relationship between caregiver stress exposure and executive functioning and ( 2 ) whether greater self-efficacy and cognitive reserve ( CR ) moderated this relationship
M	Spousal dementia caregivers ( n = 253 ) completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire ( stress exposure ) , the Perceived Stress Scale , the National Adult Reading Test ( CR ) , the Fortinsky dementiaspecific caregiver self-efficacy scale , and the Color Trails Test ( executive functioning ).
M	Moderated mediation was tested using the PROCESS macro.
M	Age , gender , and dementia risk factors were included as covariates.
R	Greater stress exposure indirectly predicted executive functioning through psychological stress.
R	Stronger relationships between greater psychological stress and poorer executive functioning were observed among caregivers with lower CR ; there was no evidence that self-efficacy moderated the relationship between stress exposure and psychological stress
C	Our findings are in line with the idea that greater psychologcal stress in response to challenges associated with dementia care predicts poorer caregiver executive functioning , particularly among caregivers with low CR.
C	However , these findings are cross sectional ; it is also possible that poorer executive functioning contributes to greater caregiver stress.
P	Recent research suggests that visual-acoustic biofeedback can be an effective treatment for residual speech errors , but adoption remains limited due to barriers including high cost and lack of familiarity with the technology.
P	This case study reports results from the first participant to complete a course of visual-acoustic biofeedback using a not-for-profit iOS app , Speech Therapist's App for /r/ Treatment.
M	App-based biofeedback treatment for rhotic misarticulation was provided in weekly 30-min sessions for 20 weeks.
M	Within-treatment progress was documented using clinician perceptual ratings and acoustic measures.
M	Generalization gains were assessed using acoustic measures of word probes elicited during baseline , treatment , and maintenance sessions.
R	Both clinician ratings and acoustic measures indicated that the participant significantly improved her rhotic production accuracy in trials elicited during treatment sessions.
R	However , these gains did not transfer to generalization probes.
C	This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration that app-based biofeedback is a viable alternative to costlier dedicated systems.
C	Generalization of gains to contexts without biofeedback remains a challenge that requires further study.
C	App-delivered biofeedback could enable clinician-research partnerships that would strengthen the evidence base while providing enhanced treatment for children with residual rhotic errors.
B	Cognitive bias modification ( CBM ) is a novel treatment for anxiety disorders that utilizes computerized tasks to train attention and interpretation biases away from threat.
B	To date , attitudes toward and acceptability of CBM have not been systematically examined.
M	We conducted qualitative interviews with 10 anxious primary care patients to examine attitudes toward and initial impressions of CBM.
M	Interviews explored general impressions , as well as reactions to the treatment rationale and two computer programs , one targeting attention bias and one targeting interpretation bias.
M	Three clinical psychologists independently coded transcripts and collaboratively developed categories and themes guided by grounded theory.
R	A number of facilitators and barriers emerged related to engaging in treatment in general , computerized treatment , and CBM specifically.
R	Participants stated that the written rationale for CBM seemed relevant and helpful.
R	However , after interacting with the attention modification program , participants frequently expressed a lack of understanding about how the program would help with anxiety.
R	Participants reported greater understanding and engagement with the interpretation modification program.
C	Participants reported a number of positive characteristics of CBM , but it may need improvements regarding its treatment rationale and credibility.
C	Future qualitative studies with individuals who complete a CBM treatment are warranted.
C	Implications for future CBM development and dissemination are discussed.
B	Literacy-rich environments ( LREs ) reflect characteristics such as abundance of materials , daily literacy routine , and layout conducive for reading and writing.
B	Shifting from previous conceptualizations , LREs are not confined to schools but are ubiquitous in formal and informal educational settings ; they include libraries , museums , bookstores , and community-based organizations.
B	An ecological approach is important for understanding how literacy is embedded in social life and everyday practice , particularly in relation to literacy learning and development.
B	It recognizes the multitude of practices in various communities and accounts for institutional and social structures that shape everyday practice.
B	Purpose/Objective/Research Question/
M	The purpose of the study is to examine LREs as part of a broader ecology of literacy and to identify the factors that may influence proximity and accessibility to LREs.
M	An ecological approach paired with geographic information systems ( GIS ) can yield various types of data visualization about spatial context.
M	St. Louis metropolitan area serves as a viable example in the study.
M	The authors employed a mixed methods approach and collected data from several sources.
M	Purposeful sampling was used to identify a number of educational and cultural institutions.
M	GIS tools were central to the creation of maps.
M	Using spatial analysis and data visualization , the authors paid attention to the emerging relationships between spatial patterns and represented demographics , evident on the maps as distance and clustering.
R	Findings indicate that an uneven geography of opportunity among underserved student populations is further compounded by a fragmented ecology of literacy.
R	The spatial arrangements of LREs suggest an uneven distribution of resources , particularly educational and cultural institutions that shape everyday life.
R	Findings suggest that factors such as race , median household income , and transportation routes influence proximity and accessibility to LREs.
C	This investigation of LREs extends current conversations about literacy and various ecologies of literacy.
C	GIS tools provided a means to examine the geospatial relationships between LREs , schools , and neighborhoods in a particular metropolitan area.
C	Focusing on St. Louis was key not only because of the researchers' growing knowledge of the place but also because there are good reasons to believe that St. Louis , with its uneven and fragmented geography , may exemplify similar phenomena taking place in other metropolitan areas.
B	The present study aims to determine the predictive power of activin A levels in the prognosis of first trimester pregnancies conceived by in vitro fertilization ( IVF ).
M	The study cohort included 23 biochemical , and 23 normal ongoing pregnancies conceived via IVF.
M	Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( beta-hCG ) , progesterone , and activin A levels were assessed 14 days after embryo transfer.
R	Serum activin A levels were significantly lower in biochemical pregnancies compared to normal ongoing pregnancies ( 0.57 vs. 0.81 ng/mL , p < 0.001 ).
R	The ability of activin A to predict normal ongoing pregnancies at a cutoff level of 0.695 ng/mL gave a sensitivity of 91.3% , a specificity of 100% , a positive predictive value of 100% , and a negative predictive value of 92%.
R	Significant correlation was found between beta-hCG and progesterone , beta-hCG and activin A , and progesterone and activin A. Activin A , beta-hCG , and progesterone were all found to be efficacious in prediction of early IVF pregnancies.
C	The present study indicates that single measurement of activin A can be suggested as a marker for the progress and outcome of early pregnancies conceived via IVF.
C	However , further large-scale studies are required to determine the efficacy and reliability of activin A in prediction of early pregnancies achieved by assisted reproductive techniques ( ART ).
B	Sickle-cell disease ( SCD ) is the most common inherited genetic disorder in sub-Saharan Africa , and it is associated with early mortality and lifelong morbidity.
B	Early diagnosis is essential for instituting appropriate care and preventive therapy.
P	To compare parental knowledge or perception of their offspring's hemoglobin phenotype prior to testing and actual validated laboratory test results.
M	In a prospective community-based survey , we assessed parental knowledge of their children's hemoglobin phenotype and corroborated this with the results from a laboratory confirmatory test determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.
R	We screened 10 ,126 children aged less than 5 years.
R	A total of 163 ( 1.6% ) parents indicated that their offspring had been previously tested and had knowledge of the child's hemoglobin genotype.
R	However , 51 ( 31.2% ) of 163 parents of children who had been previously tested did not know the result of their offspring's test , and 18 ( 35.3% ) of these 51 children were found to have SCD.
R	Of those who claimed previous knowledge , 25 ( 15.3% ) of 163 reported incorrect results.
R	Overall , we identified 272 ( 2.76% ) new cases from 9 ,963 children who had not been previously tested.
C	There is the need to promote public awareness about SCD and the benefit of early diagnosis , quality assurance in laboratory diagnosis and institution of sustainable patient care pathways.

B	Attempts to maintain or increase vaccination coverage almost all focus on supply side interventions: improving availability and delivery of vaccines.
B	The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of efforts to increase demand is uncertain.
M	We performed a systematic review of studies that provided quantitative estimates of the impact of demand side interventions on uptake of routine childhood vaccination.
M	We retrieved studies published up to Sept 2008.
R	The initial search retrieved 468 potentially eligible studies , including four systematic reviews and eight original studies of the impact of interventions to increase demand for vaccination.
R	We identified only two randomised controlled trials.
R	Interventions with an impact on vaccination uptake included knowledge translation ( KT ) ( mass media , village resource rooms and community discussions ) and non-KT initiatives ( incentives , economic empowerment , household visits by extension workers ).
R	Most claimed to increase vaccine coverage by 20 to 30%.
R	Estimates of the cost per vaccinated child varied considerably with several in the range of $10-20 per vaccinated child.
C	Most studies reviewed here represented a low level of evidence.
C	Mass media campaigns may be effective , but the impact depends on access to media and may be costly if run at a local level.
C	The persistence of positive effects has not been investigated.
C	The economics of demand side interventions have not been adequately assessed , but available data suggest that some may be very cost-effective.
B	Alcohol and drug abuse is frequent among performers and pop musicians.
B	Many of them hope that alcohol and drugs will enhance their creativity.
B	Scientific studies are scarce and conclusions limited for methodological reasons.
B	Furthermore , extraordinary creativity can hardly be grasped by empirical-statistical methods.
B	Thus , ideographic studies are necessary to learn from extraordinarily creative persons about the relationship of creativity with alcohol and drugs.
B	The pop icon Jim Morrison can serve as an exemplary case to investigate the interrelation between alcohol and drug abuse and creativity.
M	Morrison's self-assessments in his works and letters as well as the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of creativity research.
R	In the lyrics film Morrison and in biographical descriptions , we can see how Jim Morrison tried to cope with traumatic events , depressive moods and uncontrolled impulses through creative activities.
R	His talent , skill and motivation to write creatively were independent from taking alcohol and drugs.
R	He used alcohol and drugs to transgress restrictive social norms , to broaden his perceptions and to reinforce his struggle for self-actualization.
R	In short , his motivation to create something new and authentic was reinforced by alcohol and drugs.
R	More important was the influence of a supportive group that enabled Morrison's talents to flourish.
R	However , soon the frequent use of high doses of alcohol and drugs weakened his capacity to realize creative motivation.
C	Jim Morrison is an exemplary case showing that heavy drinking and the abuse of LSD , mescaline and amphetamines damages the capacity to realize creative motivation.
C	Jim Morrison is typical of creative personalities like Amy Winehouse , Janis Joplin , Brian Jones and Jimmy Hendrix who burn their creativity in early adulthood through alcohol and drugs.
C	We suppose that the sacrificial ritual of their decay offers some benefits for the excited spectators.
C	One of these is the illusion that alcohol and drugs can lead to authenticity and creativity.

B	The notion that ADHD constitutes a heterogeneous disorder is well accepted.
B	However , this study contributes with new important knowledge by examining independent effects of a large range of neuropsychological deficits.
B	In addition , the study investigated whether deficits in emotional functioning constitute a dissociable component of ADHD.
M	The study included children with ADHD ( n=102 ; 713years ) and a control sample individually matched with regard to age and gender.
M	The administered tasks were designed to tap into three different neuropsychological domains: executive functions ( i.e. , working memory , inhibition , and shifting ) , delay aversion , and reaction time variability.
M	Parent ratings of emotion regulation and a test of emotion recognition were also included.
R	Children with ADHD differed significantly from controls on all measures , except for delay aversion and recognition of disgust.
R	No main effects of gender or interaction effects of gender and group were found.
R	More importantly , executive functioning , reaction time variability , and emotional functioning all contributed independently to distinguishing between children with ADHD and controls.
C	The current study supports the view of ADHD as a heterogeneous disorder related to multiple neuropsychological deficits.
C	In addition , emotional functioning appears to be an area of importance for ADHD that needs to be incorporated into future theoretical models.
B	Female sex workers ( FSWs ) are extremely vulnerable to adverse sexual and reproductive health ( SRH ) outcomes.
B	To mitigate these risks , they require access to services covering not only HIV prevention but also contraception , cervical cancer screening and sexual violence.
B	To develop context-specific intervention packages to improve uptake , we identified gaps in service utilization in four different cities.
M	A cross-sectional survey was conducted , as part of the baseline assessment of an implementation research project.
M	FWSs were recruited in Durban , South Africa ( n = 400 ) , Mombasa , Kenya ( n = 400 ) , Mysore , India ( n = 458 ) and Tete , Mozambique ( n = 308 ) , using respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) and starting with 8-16 'seeds' identified by the peer educators.
M	FSWs responded to a standardised interviewer-administered questionnaire about the use of contraceptive methods and services for cervical cancer screening , sexual violence and unwanted pregnancies.
M	RDS-adjusted proportions and surrounding 95% confidence intervals were estimated by non-parametric bootstrapping , and compared across cities using post-hoc pairwise comparison tests with Dunn-Sidak correction.
R	Current use of any modern contraception ranged from 86.2% in Tete to 98.4% in Mombasa ( p = 0.001 ) , while non-barrier contraception ( hormonal , IUD or sterilisation ) varied from 33.4% in Durban to 85.1% in Mysore ( p < 0.001 ).
R	Ever having used emergency contraception ranged from 2.4% in Mysore to 38.1% in Mombasa ( p < 0.001 ) , ever having been screened for cervical cancer from 0.0% in Tete to 29.0% in Durban ( p < 0.001 ) , and having gone to a health facility for a termination of an unwanted pregnancy from 15.0% in Durban to 93.7% in Mysore ( p < 0.001 ).
R	Having sought medical care after forced sex varied from 34.4% in Mombasa to 51.9% in Mysore ( p = 0.860 ).
R	Many of the differences between cities remained statistically significant after adjusting for variations in FSWs' sociodemographic characteristics.
C	The use of SRH commodities and services by FSWs is often low and is highly context-specific.
C	Reasons for variation across cities need to be further explored.
C	The differences are unlikely caused by differences in socio-demographic characteristics and more probably stem from differences in the availability and accessibility of SRH services.
C	Intervention packages to improve use of contraceptives and SRH services should be tailored to the particular gaps in each city.
B	Sexual violence is widespread , yet relatively few survivors receive healthcare or complete treatment.
B	In low and middle-income countries , community health workers ( CHWs ) have the potential to provide support services to large numbers of survivors.
B	The aim of this review was to document the role of CHWs in sexual violence services.
B	We aimed to: 1 ) describe existing models of CHWs services including characteristics of CHWs , services delivered and populations served ; 2 ) explore acceptability of CHWs' services to survivors and feasibility of delivering such services ; and 3 ) document the benefits and challenges of CHW-provided sexual violence services.
M	Quantitative and qualitative studies reporting on CHWs and other community-level paraprofessional volunteer services for sexual violence were eligible for inclusion.
M	CHWs and sexual violence were defined according to WHO criteria.
M	The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
M	Quality of included studies was assessed using two quality assessment tools for quantitative , and , the methodology checklist by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for qualitative studies.
M	Data were extracted and analysed separately for quantitative and qualitative studies and results integrated using a framework approach.
R	Seven studies conducted in six countries ( Democratic Republic of Congo , Rwanda , Burma , United States of America , Scotland , Israel ) met the inclusion criteria.
R	Different models of care had diverse CHWs roles including awareness creation , identifying , educating and building relationships with survivors , psychosocial support and follow up.
R	Although sociocultural factors may influence CHWs' performance and willingness of survivors to use their services , studies often did not report on CHWs characteristics.
R	Few studies assessed acceptability of CHWs' to survivors or feasibility of delivery of services.
R	However , participants mentioned a range of benefits including decreased incidence of violence , CHWs being trusted , approachable , non-judgmental and compassionate.
R	Challenges identified were high workload , confidentiality issues and community norms influencing performance.
C	There is a dearth of research on CHWs services for sexual violence.
C	Findings suggest that involving CHWs may be beneficial , but potential challenges and harms related to CHW-provided services exist.
C	No different models of CHW-provided care have been robustly evaluated for effects on patient outcomes.
C	Further research to establish survivors' views on these services , and , their effectiveness is desperately needed.
B	It has been shown that mathematical representations can aid children's understanding of mathematical concepts but that children can sometimes have difficulty in interpreting them correctly.
B	New advances in eye-tracking technology can help in this respect because it allows data to be gathered concerning children's focus of attention and so indicate on what aspects of the representations they are focussing.
B	However , recent eye-tracking technology has not been used to any great degree in investigating the way children view and interpret mathematical representations.
P	This research explored the use of new advances in eye-tracking technology in investigating how young children view and interpret mathematical representations of multiplication.
M	Nine Year 5 children ( four boys , five girls , aged 9-10years of age ) from a local primary ( elementary ) school in the North-East of England were asked to complete the test during school time.
M	The children represented a range of attainment levels across the mathematical domain ( three higher- , three middle- and three lower-attaining children ) and were selected accordingly by their class teacher.
M	We recognise that this study was only based on a small sample of children , however , this number still allowed us to make meaningful comparisons in particular between the different types of representations presented.
M	The study consisted of each child looking at 18 static slides , one after the other , with each slide presenting a symbolic and a picture representation of multiplication problems.
M	The data that was captured by the eye tracker and recorded was then analysed quantitatively ( e.g. time on each slide , time on each area of interest specified within the software ) and qualitatively ( video recordings of each child's gaze trajectory during each representation was carried out , thereby allowing a categorisation of the different approaches adopted ).
R	The study showed that ( a ) the particular form of the number line representation used in this study was less successful than the other picture representations used ( equal groups , array ) in promoting multiplicative thinking in children , and ( b ) the success of children to think multiplicatively with the 'groups' and the array representation was related to their general mathematics attainment levels.
C	These findings have implications for teacher practice in that teachers need to be clear about the possible drawbacks of particular representations.
C	Even in using more successful representations , for lower-attaining children , the progression in their understanding of the representation needs to be taken into account by the teacher.
C	The study also highlighted that the eye-tracking technology does have some limitations but is useful in investigating young children's focus of attention whilst undertaking a mathematics assessment task.
B	Aneuploidy is one of the main causes of congenital anomalies , mental and physical disabilities , in newborns.
B	The aim of this study was to determine various chromosomal aneuploidies in the first and second trimester screening of pregnant women , in Iran.
M	A descriptive retrospective study was conducted on 125 ,170 pregnant women referred to a major referral medical diagnostic laboratory ( Niloo Laboratory , Tehran ) for prenatal screening tests ( 2010-2013 ).
M	Patients were divided into 3 groups: first trimester screening ( FTS ) , second trimester screening ( STS ) , and combined screening groups.
M	In positive and borderline cases , and amniocentesis and cytogenetic analysis were carried out.
R	Total prevalence of aneuploidy in 125 ,170 pregnant women was one in 491 , ( Detection Rate=82.7% for Down syndrome ).
R	The DR for DS in three groups was as follow: 87.5% for FTS ( 25783 women ) , 80.9% for STS ( 91345 women ) , and 94.7% for combined tests ( 8042 women ).
R	Total number of cases with Edward's syndrome was 18 , Patau's syndrome six , Klinefelter syndrome six , triploidy three , and Cri-du-chat syndrome one.
C	The present study shows the frequency of aneuploidy in the first and second trimester screenings in a major medical laboratory in Tehran.
C	The prevalence of aneuploidies grows with increased maternal age.
C	The rate of aneuploidy in first trimester is higher than second.
B	Nocturia is a chronic , fluctuating disease that disrupts sleep and has a wide-ranging impact on quality of life.
B	Valid tools to measure the patient-reported impact of nocturia are essential for evaluating the value of treatment , but the available tools are suboptimal.
P	This study reports the development and validation of the Nocturia Impact Diary an augmented form of the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire designed to be completed in conjunction with the widely used 3-day voiding diary.
M	The process comprised three steps: Step 1: Development of a concept pool using the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire and data from relevant studies ; Step 2: Content validity study ; Step 3: Psychometric testing of construct validity , reliability , and sensitivity of the diary in a randomized , placebo controlled study in patients with nocturia.
R	Step 1: Fourteen items and 4 domains were included in the first draft of the diary.
R	Step 2: Twenty-three patients with nocturia participated in the cognitive debriefing study.
R	Items were adjusted accordingly , and the content validity was high.
R	Step 3: Fifty-six patients were randomized to desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet or placebo.
R	The diary demonstrated high construct validity , with good sensitivity and a good fit to Rasch model , as well as high internal consistency , discriminatory ability , and acceptable sensitivity to change.
R	Results indicated that the diary was unidimensional.
C	The Nocturia Impact Diary is a convenient , validated patient-reported outcome measure it should be used in conjunction with a voiding diary to capture the real-life consequences of nocturia and its treatment.
P	Verbal working memory in children with cochlear implants and children with normal hearing was examined.
M	Ninety-three fourth graders ( 47 with normal hearing , 46 with cochlear implants ) participated , all of whom were in a longitudinal study and had working memory assessed 2 years earlier.
M	A dual-component model of working memory was adopted , and a serial recall task measured storage and processing.
M	Potential predictor variables were phonological awareness , vocabulary knowledge , nonverbal IQ , and several treatment variables.
M	Potential dependent functions were literacy , expressive language , and speech-in-noise recognition.
R	Children with cochlear implants showed deficits in storage and processing , similar in size to those at second grade.
R	Predictors of verbal working memory differed across groups: Phonological awareness explained the most variance in children with normal hearing ; vocabulary explained the most variance in children with cochlear implants.
R	Treatment variables explained little of the variance.
R	Where potentially dependent functions were concerned , verbal working memory accounted for little variance once the variance explained by other predictors was removed.
C	The verbal working memory deficits of children with cochlear implants arise due to signal degradation , which limits their abilities to acquire phonological awareness.
C	That hinders their abilities to store items using a phonological code.
B	The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-IV-TR ;American Psychiatric Association [APA] , 2000 ) has emphasized the importance of understanding psychopathology within a cultural framework by including culture-bound syndromes within its appendices.
B	These syndromes are proposed to be hound to certain cultures and distinct from other psychological disorders.
B	Included among the syndromes are ataques de nervios ( ADN ) , which are reported to be bound to the Hispanic culture and closely resemble panic attacks.
B	However , the cultural distinctiveness and phenomenology of ADN has not been adequately investigated.
M	The current study employed all ethnically diverse study sample ( N = 342 ) of undergraduates.
M	Participants completed a number of measures that assessed acculturation , syndrome and anxiety risk factors.
R	In contrast to the DSM-IV's conceptualization of ADN , the rate of ADN did not significantly vary across the three main groups ( African American , Caucasian , and Hispanic participants ) nor did it vary based on acculturation.
R	More consistent with the DSM-IV , the symptom comparisons indicated some differentiation between ADN and panic attacks.
C	The present report provides data indicating that ADNs , as described by the DSM-IV , are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement.
C	The findings are consistent with the DSM-IV assertion that ADNs and PAs are distinct syndromes.

B	Infertility is a serious problem for those who suffer.
B	Some of the risks for infertility are preventable and the individual should therefore have knowledge of them.
B	The purposes of this study were to investigate high-school students' knowledge about fertility , plans for family building and to compare views and knowledge between female and male students.
M	A questionnaire containing 34 items was answered by 274 students.
M	Answers from male and female students were compared using student's t-test for normally distributed variables and Mann-Whitney U-test for non-normal distributions.
M	The chi-square test was used to compare proportions of male and female students who answered questions on nominal and ordinal scales.
M	Differences were considered as statistically significant at a p-value of 0.05.
R	Analyses showed that 234 ( 85% ) intended to have children.
R	Female students felt parenthood to be significantly more important than male students: p = <0.01.
R	The mean age at which the respondents thought they would like to start to build their family was 26 ( +/- 2.9 ) years.
R	Men believed that women's fertility declined significantly later than women did: p = <0.01.
R	Women answered that 30.7% couples were involuntarily infertile and men answered 22.5%: p = <0.01.
R	Females thought it significantly more likely that they would consider IVF or adoption than men , p = 0.01.
R	Men felt they were more likely to abstain from having children than women: p = <0.01.
R	Women believed that body weight influenced fertility significantly more often than men: p = <0.01 and men believed significantly more often that smoking influenced fertility: p = 0.03.
R	Both female and male students answered that they would like to have more knowledge about the area of fertility.
C	Young people plan to start their families when the woman's fertility is already in decline.
C	Improving young people's knowledge about these issues would give them more opportunity to take responsibility for their sexual health and to take an active role in shaping political change to improve conditions for earlier parenthood.
P	The authors of this study examined relationships between measures of word and speech error variability and between these and other speech and language measures in preschool children with speech sound disorder ( SSD ).
M	In this correlational study , 18 preschool children with SSD , age-appropriate receptive vocabulary , and normal oral motor functioning and hearing were assessed across 2 sessions.
M	Experimental measures included word and speech error variability , receptive vocabulary , nonword repetition ( NWR ) , and expressive language.
M	Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated among the experimental measures.
R	The correlation between word and speech error variability was slight and nonsignificant.
R	The correlation between word variability and receptive vocabulary was moderate and negative , although nonsignificant.
R	High word variability was associated with small receptive vocabularies.
R	The correlations between speech error variability and NWR and between speech error variability and the mean length of children's utterances were moderate and negative , although both were nonsignificant.
R	High speech error variability was associated with poor NWR and language scores.
C	High word variability may reflect unstable lexical representations , whereas high speech error variability may reflect indistinct phonological representations.
C	Preschool children with SSD who show abnormally high levels of different types of speech variability may require slightly different approaches to intervention.
B	Over 100 million Americans are living with chronic pain , and pain is the most common reason that patients seek medical attention.
B	Despite the prevalence of pain , the practice of pain management and the scientific discipline of pain research are relatively new fields compared to the rest of medicine contributing to a twenty-first century dilemma for health care providers asked to relieve suffering in the "Fifth Vital Sign" era.
M	This manuscript provides a narrative review of the basic mechanisms of chronic pain and history of chronic pain management in the United States including the various regulatory , health system and provider factors that contributed to the decline of multidisciplinary pain treatment in favor of the predominant opioid treatment strategy seen today.
M	Multiple non-opioid pain treatment strategies are then outlined.
M	The manuscript concludes with three key questions to help guide future research at the intersection of pain and addiction.
C	The assessment and treatment of chronic pain will continue to be one of the most common functions of a health care provider.
C	To move beyond an over reliance on opioid medications , the addiction and pain research communities must unite with chronic pain patients to increase the evidence base supporting non-opioid analgesic strategies.

B	One in five women veterans screens positive for alcohol misuse.
B	Women may be less likely than men to disclose alcohol use to a primary care provider ( PCP ) , resulting in women being less likely to receive effective interventions.
B	We sought to qualitatively examine factors that may affect women veterans' willingness to disclose alcohol use to a PCP.
M	Between October 2012 and May 2013 , in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 women veterans at two Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) medical facilities.
M	Qualitative data analyses identified common themes representing factors that influence women's decision to disclose alcohol use to a PCP.
R	Nine themes were endorsed by women veterans as influencing their willingness to disclose alcohol use to their PCP.
R	Themes included provider behaviors perceived as encouraging or discouraging disclosure of alcohol misuse , perceived positive relationship with provider , negative emotions such as concerns about being judged or labeled an "alcoholic ," health concerns about drinking , non-health-related concerns about drinking , self-appraisal of drinking behavior , social support , and clinic factors.
C	Our findings demonstrate the importance of social relationships , comfort with one's provider , and education on the potential harms ( especially health related ) associated with alcohol in encouraging disclosure of alcohol use in women veterans.
C	Our results also support VA national health care efforts , including the provision of brief alcohol counseling and the use of primary care clinics specializing in the care of women veterans.

B	The psychosocial evaluation is an important part of the live organ donor evaluation process , yet this is not standardized across institutions.
P	This study was designed to prospectively test the reliability and validity of a semistructured psycho social evaluation tool that was recently developed and reported in the literature ( the Live Donor Assessment Tool [LDAT 1 ).
M	A total of 248 live donor candidates who presented for evaluation were invited to participate in a study that involved the LDAT being scored as part of the standard psychosocial evaluation process ; 222 provided informed consent.
M	Evaluations were conducted by staff experienced with psychosocial evaluation of living donors and trained in the use of the LDAT.
M	Furthermore , 123 donor candidates were evaluated twice , as per routine standard of care , and had 2 LDATs administered.
M	Reliability of the LDAT was assessed by calculating the internal consistency of the LDAT items and inter-rater reliability.
M	Validity was assessed by comparing LDAT scores across the risk group categories ( the traditional outcome designation of the psychosocial evaluation ) and in 86 eventual donors , associations between LDAT scores , and indicators of psychosocial outcomes post-donation.
R	The LDAT was found to have good internal consistency , strong inter-rater reliability , and showed signs of validity: LDAT scores differentiated the traditional risk-group categories , and a significant association between LDAT score and treatment adherence post donation was revealed
C	The LDAT demonstrated good reliability and validity , but future research on the LDAT and the ability to implement the LDAT across institutions is warranted.
B	The World Health Organization ( WHO ) selected antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) as the theme for World Health Day 2011.
B	The slogan was "Combat Drug Resistance - No action today , no cure tomorrow" A six-point policy package was launched as a core product for World Health Day.
B	It aimed to stimulate extensive and coherent action to overcome the many challenges presented by antimicrobial resistance.
M	As a preparation for World Health Day , interviews were conducted with a series of key informants , mainly senior government staff , to assess their awareness of the topic and the interventions proposed in the policy package.
M	Since the key informant interview methodology was used with a small number of interviewees , it may be difficult to demonstrate the validity of the findings.
R	Key informants from twelve out of fifteen countries responded , which included Fiji ( n = 5 ) , Kiribati ( n = 1 ) , Lao PDR ( n = 2 ) , Malaysia ( n = 6 ) , Micronesia ( n = 3 ) , Mongolia ( n = 5 ) , the Philippines ( n = 5 ) , Vietnam ( n = 6 ) , Vanuatu ( n = 1 ) , Solomon Islands ( n = 3 ) , Cambodia ( n = 5 ) and Brunei ( n = 1 ).
R	There was a total of forty-three respondents ( n = 43 ).
R	AMR was widely recognized as a problem.
R	Lack of a coherent , comprehensive and national plan or strategy was noted.
R	Surveillance was often seen as weak and fragmented even where presented.
R	Laboratory capacity was felt to be insufficient across all countries interviewed.
R	The majority of respondents stressed the need for national and local plans to combat AMR including reliable estimates of the financial cost of combating and managing AMR , the need for legislation to control inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food animals and more serious efforts to promote Standard Treatment Guidelines ( STGs ) and Rational Prescription.
R	Also , importance was highlighted of the need to include infection prevention and control ( IPC ) as a part of accreditation and registration of health institutions and programs to promote IPC to the general population.
C	A coalition of interested parties at the local , national and international levels need to generate and sustain the political will to organize a more comprehensive , sustainable , and coherent approach to AMR.
P	The purpose of this study was to identify trends for studies published in the Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing and journals published by member societies from inaugural issues to 2010.
M	A total of 6890 studies were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
R	Quantitative studies accounted for 83.6% while qualitative studies accounted for 14.4%.
R	Most frequently used research designs were quasi-experimental ( 91.1% ) for experimental research and survey ( 85.2% ) for non-experimental research.
R	Most frequent study participants were healthy people ( 35.8% ) , most frequent nursing interventions , nursing skills ( 53.5% ) , and 39.8% used knowledge , attitude and behavior outcomes for dependent variables.
R	Most frequently used keyword was elderly.
R	Survey studies decreased from 1991 to 2010 by approximately 50% , while qualitative studies increased by about 20%.
R	True experimental research ( 1.2% ) showed no significant changes.
R	Studies focusing on healthy populations increased from 2001-2005 ( 37.5% ) to 2006-2010( 41.0% ).
R	From 1970 to 2010 , studies using questionnaire accounted for over 50% whereas physiological measurement , approximately 5% only.
R	Experimental studies using nursing skill interventions increased from 1970-1980 ( 30.4% ) to 2006-2010 ( 64.0% ).
R	No significant changes were noted in studies using knowledge , attitude and behavior ( 39.9% ) as dependent variables.
C	The results suggest that further expansion of true experimental , qualitative studies and physiological measurements are needed.
B	Industrialization and rising standards of living have contributed to a growing amount of solid waste and consequent disposal problems.
B	Solid waste collection is among the occupations with the highest risk for musculoskeletal disorders.
P	We have conducted this study to assess musculoskeletal complaints and work-related stress levels among municipal solid waste ( MSW ) collectors.
M	The subjects were all currently employed at the MSW Department of the City of Ankara , Turkey.
M	Validated questionnaires were completed by 267 MSW collectors.
M	Data analysis was performed using SPSS software ( 22.0 version ).
R	Upper back pain rate was 89.1% among the collectors.
R	47.9% of collectors reported having had upper back pain during the last 12 months and 38.7% had experienced it during the last month.
R	80.9% of the sample complained of shoulder pain.
R	Wrists/hands and neck pain rates were found at rates of 78.7% and 67.8% respectively.
R	Psychological demands , were significantly higher among MSW collectors living with moderate-severe pain.
C	Ergonomics education , healthy work habits , occupational safety training and improvements in the psychosocial work environment should be considered.
B	In Sweden , the smoking prevalence has declined.
B	In 2007 , it was among the lowest in the industrialized world.
B	A steady increase in the use of Swedish oral moist snuff , snus , has occurred in parallel.
B	This development is neither solicited by authorities nor the medical establishment , but rather has occurred along with increased awareness of the dangers of smoking , and has been promoted by product development and marketing of snus.
P	To evaluate time trends in patterns of tobacco use in northern Sweden during 1990-2007.
M	Cross-sectional ( 99 ,381 subjects ) and longitudinal ( 26 ,867 subjects ) data from the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme ( VIP ) 1990-2007 were analyzed.
M	All adults in Vasterbotten County are invited to a VIP health examination at ages 40 , 50 , and 60 years , and until 1995 also 30 years.
M	Smoking and use of snus were evaluated by gender , age and educational groups.
M	Intermittent smoking was categorized as smoking.
R	From the period 1990-1995 to the period 2002-2007 , smoking prevalence decreased from 26 to 16% among men and from 27 to 18% among women.
R	The differences in prevalence increased between educational groups.
R	The decline in smoking was less and the increase of snus use was greater among those with basic education.
R	The use of snus among basic-educated 40-year-olds reached 35% among men and 14% among women during 2002-2007.
R	Dual smoking and snus use increased among men and women with basic education.
R	Smoking without snus use was more prevalent among women.
R	Gender differences in total smoking prevalence ( smoking only plus dual use ) were small in all age groups , but increased among those with basic education reaching 7.3% during 2002-2007 , with women being more frequent smokers.
R	Smoking prevalences were similar among never , former and current snus users.
R	Among the 30 ,000 former smokers , 38% of men and 64% of women had never used snus.
R	Longitudinal data showed a decline in total tobacco use from baseline until follow-up and this was mainly due to a smoking cessation rate of <1% a year.
R	Snus use was started by 6.2% of the 30-year-old women ( age at baseline ) , and this contributed to a stable prevalence of total tobacco use in this group.
R	Seventy percent of baseline snus users still used snus at follow-up.
R	Among smokers , 55% continued smoking , 12% of men and 7% of women switched to snus.
R	Among those with dual tobacco use at baseline , a third of men and a fourth of women remained dual users 10 years later.
C	There are increasing differences in tobacco use between educational groups.
C	Higher smoking and snus use prevalence are found among those with basic education , and this is most pronounced in the younger group of this middle-aged population.
C	In spite of a higher prevalence of smoking without snus use among women , total smoking prevalence is similar in men and women due to a higher prevalence of dual tobacco use , i.e. snus and cigarettes , among men.
C	The increase in snus use is being paralleled by a slight increase in dual use and the smoking prevalence does not seem to be influenced by snus.
C	This should be the subject of further studies and also have implications for tobacco control policies.
B	Although the incidence of legionellosis throughout North America and Europe continues to increase , public health investigations have not been able to identify a common exposure in most cases.
B	Over 80% of cases are sporadic with no known source.
B	To better understand the role of the macro-environment in legionellosis risk , a retrospective ecological study assessed associations between population-level measures of demographic , socioeconomic , and environmental factors and high-risk areas.
M	Geographic variability and clustering of legionellosis was explored in our study setting using the following methods: unadjusted and standardized incidence rate and SaTScan ( TM ) cluster detection methods using default scanning window of 1 and 50% as well as a reliability score methodology.
M	Methods for classification of "high-risk" census tracts ( areas roughly equivalent to a neighborhood with average population of 4000 ) for each of the spatial methods are presented.
M	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations with sociodemographic factors: population >= 65 years of age , non-white race , Hispanic ethnicity , poverty , less than or some high school education ; housing factors: housing vacant , renter-occupied , and built pre-1950 and pre-1970 ; and whether drinking water is groundwater or surface water source.
R	Census tracts with high percentages of poverty , Hispanic population , and non-white population were more likely to be classified as high-risk for legionellosis versus a low-risk census tract.
R	Vacant housing , renter-occupied housing , and homes built pre-1970 were also important positively associated risk factors.
R	Drinking water source was not found to be associated with legionellosis incidence.
C	Census tract level demographic , socioeconomic , and environmental characteristics are important risk factors of legionellosis and add to our understanding of the macro-environment for legionellosis occurrence.
C	Our findings can be used by public health professionals to target disease prevention communication to vulnerable populations.
C	Future studies are needed to explore the exact mechanisms by which these risk factors may influence legionellosis clustering.
B	Despite important improvements in available prevention and treatment , cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality.
B	Not all high-risk patients and patients with CVD have healthy lifestyles and receive the best possible healthcare.
B	Internationally comparative data are needed to compare cardiovascular risk management in different countries , and to examine the impact of improvement programs and others factors.
P	This study aims to provide internationally comparative data on cardiovascular risk management provided in primary care and on health-related lifestyles of patients in Europe.
P	The study will also explore the views of doctors and patients on innovative preventive services for CVDs.
M	An observational cross-sectional study is planned.
M	In 10 European countries , stratified samples of 36 practices per country will be recruited.
M	In each practice , three samples of 15 patients each will be sampled: patients with coronary heart disease , patients at high risk for CVD , and healthy adult patients.
M	The quality of cardiovascular risk management has been specified in terms of 44 performance indicators that resulted from an international Delphi-procedure with general practitioners.
M	Most indicators are based on medical records , and some on a structured interview with a contact person of the practice.
M	Lifestyle ( smoking , physical exercise , diet ) will be measured with previously validated questionnaires that are completed by patients.
M	Additional measures include practice characteristics and exposure to programs to improve cardiovascular care.
B	Bacterial gastrointestinal infections cause considerable morbidity in industrialized countries , but little is known about socioeconomic factors affecting the risk of infection.
M	By linkage among 3 national registers , we followed the entire population of Denmark ( 5.3 million people ) from 1993 to 2004 for the occurrence of laboratory-confirmed bacterial gastrointestinal infections.
M	Using Poisson regression analyses , incidence rate ratios ( IRRs ) were estimated for the major groups of bacteria in different socioeconomic strata , focusing on income group , level of education , marital status , number of children in the household , and country of birth.
R	Associations with socioeconomic variables varied by type of bacterium.
R	High-income groups had increased risks of infection with Campylobacter , Shigella , and Salmonella Enteritidis , and education was positively associated with increased risk of infection with Campylobacter and Shigella.
R	Married persons were generally at higher risk than single persons , but adults with children had lower risks compared with adults without children.
R	Foreign-born persons generally had lower risks , whereas Danish-born persons with foreign-born parents were at reduced risk of infection with the pork-associated bacterium Yersinia ( IRR = 0.33 ; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.42 ) , but increased risk with Shigella ( 5.7 ; 4.8-6.1 ) , Salmonella , and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli.
C	The findings suggest that risk of infection is not primarily associated with poverty , but rather with increasing socioeconomic status.
C	Risk of infection also varies with cultural background.
C	Observed differences may be explained by differences in diet and travel activity , although they may also in part reflect differential probabilities of diagnostic reporting.
P	A growing body of research documents the significance of siblings and sibling relationships for development , mental health , and behavioral risk across childhood and adolescence.
P	Nonetheless , few well-designed efforts have been undertaken to promote positive and reduce negative youth outcomes by enhancing sibling relationships.
M	Based on a theoretical model of sibling influences , we conducted a randomized trial of Siblings Are Special ( SIBS ) , a group-format afterschool program for fifth graders with a younger sibling in second through fourth grades , which entailed 12 weekly afterschool sessions and three Family Nights.
M	We tested program efficacy with a pre- and post-test design with 174 families randomly assigned to condition.
M	In home visits at both time points , we collected data via parent questionnaires , child interviews , and observer-rated videotaped interactions and teachers rated children's behavior at school.
R	The program enhanced positive sibling relationships , appropriate strategies for parenting siblings , and child self-control , social competence , and academic performance ; program exposure was also associated with reduced maternal depression and child internalizing problems.
R	Results were robust across the sample , not qualified by sibling gender , age , family demographics , or baseline risk.
R	No effects were found for sibling conflict , collusion , or child externalizing problems ; we will examine follow-up data to determine if short-term impacts lead to reduced negative behaviors over time.
C	The breadth of the SIBS program's impact is consistent with research suggesting that siblings are an important influence on development and adjustment and supports our argument that a sibling focus should be incorporated into youth and family-oriented prevention programs.

B	Medical students report high levels of stress related to their medical training as well as to other personal and financial factors.
B	The aim of this study is to investigate whether there are differences in course-related stressors reported by medical students on undergraduate problem-based learning ( PBL ) and non-PBL programmes in the UK.
M	A cross-sectional study of second-year medical students in two UK medical schools ( one PBL and one non-PBL programme ) was conducted.
M	A 16-question self-report questionnaire , derived from the Perceived Medical Student Stress Scale and the Higher Education Stress Inventory , was used to measure course-related stressors.
M	Following univariate analysis of each stressor between groups , multivariate logistic regression was used to determine which stressors were the best predictors of each course type , while controlling for socio-demographic differences between the groups.
R	A total of 280 students responded.
R	Compared to the non-PBL students ( N = 197 ) , the PBL students ( N = 83 ) were significantly more likely to agree that: they did not know what the faculty expected of them ( Odds Ratio ( OR ) = 0.38 , p = 0.03 ) ; there were too many small group sessions facilitated only by students resulting in an unclear curriculum ( OR = 0.04 , p < 0.0001 ) ; and that there was a lack of opportunity to explore academic subjects of interest ( OR = 0.40 , p = 0.02 ).
R	They were significantly more likely to disagree that: there was a lack of encouragement from teachers ( OR = 3.11 , p = 0.02 ) ; and that the medical course fostered a sense of anonymity and feelings of isolation amongst students ( OR = 3.42 , p = 0.008 ).
C	There are significant differences in the perceived course-related stressors affecting medical students on PBL and non-PBL programmes.
C	Course designers and student support services should therefore tailor their work to minimise , or help students cope with , the specific stressors on each course type to ensure optimum learning and wellbeing among our future doctors.
P	A significant relationship between verbal short-term memory ( STM ) and language performance in people with aphasia has been found across studies.
P	However , very few studies have examined the predictive value of verbal STM in treatment outcomes.
P	This study aims to determine if verbal STM can be used as a predictor of treatment success.
M	Retrospective data from 25 people with aphasia in a larger randomized controlled trial of phonomotor treatment were analyzed.
M	Digit and word spans from immediately pretreatment were run in multiple linear regression models to determine whether they predict magnitude of change from pre- to posttreatment and follow-up naming accuracy.
M	Pretreatment , immediately posttreatment , and 3 months posttreatment digit and word span scores were compared to determine if they changed following a novel treatment approach.
R	Verbal STM , as measured by digit and word spans , did not predict magnitude of change in naming accuracy from pre- to posttreatment nor from pretreatment to 3 months posttreatment.
R	Furthermore , digit and word spans did not change from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to 3 months posttreatment in the overall analysis.
R	A post hoc analysis revealed that only the less impaired group showed significant changes in word span scores from pretreatment to 3 months posttreatment.
C	The results suggest that digit and word spans do not predict treatment gains.
C	In a less severe subsample of participants , digit and word span scores can change following phonomotor treatment ; however , the overall results suggest that span scores may not change significantly.
C	The implications of these findings are discussed within the broader purview of theoretical and empirical associations between aphasic language and verbal STM processing.
P	The cumulative time that critical care nurses spend implementing a tight glycaemic control ( TGC ) protocol was estimated in a time-in-motion ( TiM ) study conducted in a hospital in the UK.
B	TGC protocols were introduced to the critical care setting to reduce hyperglycaemic events in high-risk patients.
B	The time burden to critical care nurses of implementing such protocols has not yet been studied in the UK.
M	A prospective TiM pilot study was conducted in an eligible UK intensive care unit by four protocol-trained observers over five consecutive weekdays from 3 to 7 November 2008.
M	Three nurses were also interviewed on site to gather their attitudes and perceptions about the benefits of and time associated with administering a TGC protocol.
M	Independent observers shadowed nurses , observing when a blood glucose measurement was taken , when each predefined subtask was completed and the duration of each task.
M	Semistructured interviews with nurses were conducted in-person and one-on-one by a trained study member.
R	Considered together , the episodic median duration of all TGC activities was 6.65 min.
R	Across a total shift , nurses devoted approximately 7% of their time to administering a TGC protocol.
R	Nurses perceived that a TGC protocol is beneficial to patient safety and outcomes in a critical care setting but acknowledged that the tasks can be mildly to moderately tedious.
C	This TiM analysis indicated that the additional responsibility of implementing a TGC protocol represents a substantive commitment of nursing time in a critical care setting.
C	The episodic data of our pilot study in the UK contributes further evidence that TGC protocols may be arduous to maintain and constitute a substantial investment of nursing time.
B	Opioid dependence is a major risk factor for HIV infection , however , the impact of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment on HIV risk behaviors among HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients is unknown.
M	We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 303 HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients initiating buprenorphine/naloxone treatment.
M	Outcomes included self-reported past 90-day needle-sharing and non-condom use.
M	We assessed trends over the 12 months using the Cochran-Armitage trend test.
M	Using generalized estimating equations , after multiple imputation , we determined factors independently associated with needle-sharing and non-condom use , including time-updated variables.
M	We then conducted a mediation analysis to determine whether substance use explained the relationship between time since treatment initiation and needle-sharing.
R	Needle-sharing decreased from baseline to the fourth quarter following initiation of buprenorphine/naloxone ( 9% vs. 3% , p < 0.001 ) , while non-condom use did not ( 23% vs. 21% , p = 0.10 ).
R	HIV risk behaviors did not vary based on the presence of a detectable HIV-1 RNA viral load.
R	Patients who were homeless and used heroin , cocaine/amphetamines or marijuana were more likely to report needle-sharing.
R	Heroin use fully mediated the relationship between time since treatment initiation and needle-sharing.
R	Women , patients who identified as being gay/lesbian/bisexual , those married or living with a partner and who reported heroin or alcohol use were more likely to report non-condom use.
R	Older patients were less likely to report non-condom use.
C	While buprenorphine/naloxone is associated with decreased needle-sharing among HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients , sexual risk behaviors persist regardless of viral load.
C	Targeted interventions to address HIV risk behaviors among HIV-infected opioid-dependent populations receiving buprenorphine/naloxone are needed.

P	To explore the existing theoretical contexts of the job and environmental demands of the nursing profession in the National Health Service ( NHS ) and to investigate how these job and environmental demands impact on the personal constructs of older nurses within the NHS.
B	Nursing is the single most widely practiced profession in the healthcare sector in the United Kingdom.
B	However , nurses contend with challenging job and environmental demands on a daily basis , which deplete them of personal constructs ( or resources ) required to stay in the profession.
M	A multilevel exploratory qualitative research design was employed.
M	Ten managers were interviewed for the preliminary study , based on which the three characteristics of an age-friendly NHS workplace were established: health , retirement , and flexibility.
M	Then an in-depth literature review revealed that the most adversely affected job within the NHS was the nursing profession.
M	Finally , a focus group study was undertaken with six older nurses working in the NHS.
R	The most compelling finding of this study is that older nurses would generally not want to stay on the job if they had to work in the ward area.
R	The physical , cognitive , and sensory constructs of older nurses are negatively affected by the job and environmental demands of the ward areas.
C	Understanding how these job and environmental demands of the workplace affect an older nurse's personal constructs may help support a better design of nurse work and the wards and help extend the working lives of older nurses in the NHS.
P	This study investigated the presence and influence of intrusive thoughts among adults previously diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome.
M	The present study used an Internet-based survey completed by a sample ( N = 326 ) from two national organizations.
R	After controlling for age , gender , and pain level , intrusive thoughts were significantly related to disability and health-related quality of life.
C	Intrusive thoughts about the inciting event that caused CRPS uniquely influenced pain and quality of life , suggesting a potential mechanism to target for intervention.
C	Understanding factors that relate to maintenance of CRPS and its resulting disability will help in the development of treatments to improve quality of life.
B	Neighborhood-level characteristics , including police activity , are associated with HIV and Hepatitis C injection risk-behaviors among people who inject drugs ( PWID ).
B	However , the pathways through which these neighborhood perceptions shape individual-level HIV risk behaviors are unclear.
B	This study helps to explain perceived behaviors between perceived neighborhood police activity and HIV injection risk behavior ( i.e. , injection syringe/tool sharing in the previous 6 months ).
M	A sample of ( n = 366 ) PWIDs who self-reported recent use were recruited using community-based outreach methods in Baltimore , Maryland.
M	Neighborhood police perceptions were assessed by asking participants whether they would ( 1 ) be more likely to ask others to share injection tools in the context of heightened police activity and ( 2 ) be less likely to carry syringes with them due to fear of arrest.
M	Poisson regression with robust variance was used to identify statistical relationships.
M	Recent police encounters , frequency of heroin injection , and sociodemographic characteristics were controlled for in the model.
R	Neighborhood police perceptions shaped injection-risk behavior.
R	Half of the sample ( 49% ) reported an aversion of carrying personal syringes , due to fear of arrest.
R	Those who agreed they would be more likely to ask others to share injection equipment in the context of heightened police activity were more likely to share syringes ( 21% vs. 3% , p <.01 ).
R	Adjusted models showed that syringe sharing was independently associated with asking to borrow equipment in neighborhoods with perceived heightened police activity ( aPR: 2.22 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ): 1.7 , 3.0 ).
C	This study sheds light on how police perceptions may influence injection risk behavior.
C	While these relationships require further elucidation , this study suggests that public health interventions aiming to reduce HIV risk would benefit from improving community-police relationships.
B	Women with cervical cancer now have relatively good 5-year survival rates.
B	Better survival rates have driven the paradigm in cancer care from a medical illness model to a wellness model , which is concerned with the quality of women's lives as well as the length of survival.
B	Thus , the assessment of quality of life among cervical cancer survivors is increasingly paramount for healthcare professionals.
B	The purposes of this review were to describe existing validated quality of life instruments used in cervical cancer survivors , and to reveal the implications of quality of life measurement for Chinese cervical cancer survivors.
M	A literature search of five electronic databases was conducted using the terms cervical/cervix cancer , quality of life , survivors , survivorship , measurement , and instruments.
M	Articles published in either English or Chinese from January 2000 to June 2009 were searched.
M	Only those adopting an established quality of life instrument for use in cervical cancer survivors were included.
R	A total of 11 validated multidimensional quality of life instruments were identified from 41 articles.
R	These instruments could be classified into four categories: generic , cancer-specific , cancer site-specific and cancer survivor-specific instruments.
R	With internal consistency varying from 0.68-0.99 , the test-retest reliability ranged from 0.60-0.95 based on the test of the Pearson coefficient.
R	One or more types of validity supported the construct validity.
R	Although all these instruments met the minimum requirements of reliability and validity , the original versions of these instruments were mainly in English.
C	Selection of an instrument should consider the purpose of investigation , take its psychometric properties into account , and consider the instrument's origin and comprehensiveness.
C	As quality of life can be affected by culture , studies assessing the quality of life of cervical cancer survivors in China or other non-English speaking countries should choose or develop instruments relevant to their own cultural context.
C	There is a need to develop a comprehensive quality of life instrument for Chinese cervical cancer survivors across the whole survivorship , including immediately after diagnosis and for short- ( less than 5 years ) and long-term ( more than 5 years ) survivorship.
B	In Sweden , as well as in most industrialised countries , an increasing older population is expected to create a growing demand for health care staff.
B	Previous studies have pointed to lack of proficient medical and nursing staff specialised in geriatric care , which poses serious threats to the care of a vulnerable population.
B	At the same time , there are studies describing elderly care as a low-status career choice , attracting neither nurses nor student nurses.
B	Judging from previous research it was deemed important to explore how nurses in elderly care perceive their work , thus possibly provide vital knowledge that can guide nurse educators and unit managers as a means to promote a career in elderly care.
P	The aim of the present study was to illuminate how nurses , working in nursing homes and home-based care , perceived their professional work.
M	This was a qualitative study using focus groups.
M	30 registered nurses in seven focus groups were interviewed.
M	The participants worked in nursing homes and home-based care for the elderly in rural areas and in a larger city in southern Sweden.
M	The interviews were analysed in line with the tradition of naturalistic inquiry.
R	Our findings illustrate how nurses working in elderly care perceived their professional work as holistic and respectful nursing.
R	Three categories of professional work emerged during analysis: ( 1 ) establishing long-term relationships , ( 2 ) nursing beyond technical skills , and ( 3 ) balancing independence and a sense of loneliness.
C	The findings are important as they represent positive alternatives to the somewhat prevailing view on elderly care as depressing and undemanding.
C	Nurse educators might use the key aspects as good examples , thus influencing student nurses' attitudes towards elderly care in a positive way.
C	Elderly care agencies might find them helpful when recruiting and retaining nurses to a much needed area.

B	The speech disorder associated with Friedreich's ataxia ( FRDA ) is classically described as ataxic dysarthria.
B	However , variable neuropathology beyond the cerebellum , which may include the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts , means that the dysarthria can be mixed rather than a pure ataxic dysarthria.
P	To characterize physiological features of the dysarthria associated with FRDA and identify differential patterns of deviation that may occur across the subsystems of the speech-production mechanism in a series of seven case studies.
M	The assessment battery included a perceptual analysis of a speech sample using an interval rating scale , and a range of instrumental measures to investigate the respiratory , laryngeal , velopharyngeal and articulatory systems.
R	The results demonstrated the variability that exists in the dysarthria associated with FRDA , highlighting the existence of differential profiles of speech impairment.
R	A particular distinction was observed between the presence of hypernasality and phonatory dysfunction , as evidenced by the instrumental results.
C	The distinct profiles of dysarthria associated with FRDA indicate that approaches that address multiple subsystems are necessary for the accurate characterization and quantification of the motor speech disorder.
C	Further research is required to investigate the decline in speech function as the disease progresses , as changes in speech function over time may be a good indicator of neurological decline in FRDA.
B	Sleep disturbance is a major problem for older adults , calling for the development of alternative medicine techniques to help improve sleep quality in this population.
P	The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a Baduanjin exercise program on sleep quality in Taiwanese elderly.
M	A randomized controlled trial , longitudinal research design was employed.
M	This study was conducted in an urban area of northern Taiwan.
M	The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: ( 1 ) community-dwelling older adults age 60 years or older ; ( 2 ) no regular exercise within 6 months ; ( 3 ) able to communicate ; and ( 4 ) independent in self-care.
M	Subjects were excluded if they had ( 1 ) depression tendency as demonstrated by the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Score of eight or higher ; ( 2 ) impaired mobility ; or ( 3 ) unstable health status.
M	A total of 202 older people were screened for this study , 87 of whom were eligible according to the inclusion criteria.
M	Of these , 55 completed the 12-week study.
M	Fifty-five participants were randomly assigned to the exercise group ( 27 ) or the control group ( 28 ).
M	Those in the exercise group received 12 weeks of Baduanjin exercise training , while those in the control group had no intervention.
M	The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index was administered to subjects at four time points: before the intervention , and at the 4th , 8th , and 12th week after intervention.
R	Subjects in the Baduanjin exercise group had significantly improved overall sleep quality , subjective sleep quality , sleep latency , sleep duration , sleep efficiency , and daytime dysfunction after 12 weeks of intervention ( p < 0.001 ) , while those in control group showed no significant difference in sleep quality.
R	Compared with the control group , the Baduanjin exercise group reported significantly better sleep quality after four weeks of intervention which was maintained throughout the 12-week exercise period.
C	This study confirmed that the Baduanjin exercise program can improve sleep quality for Taiwanese community-dwelling older adults.
C	We recommend application of this simple , gentle exercise program in older persons to improve their sleep quality.

P	To compare prevalence and describe predictors of antiretroviral treatment adherence among adolescents with HIV acquired perinatally ( PIY ) or through risk behaviors ( BIY ).
M	Data were obtained from the baseline assessment of Adolescent Impact , an intervention for HIV-infected adolescents receiving care in three U. S. cities.
M	Patients self-reported missed medication doses as well as medication factors , HIV knowledge , disclosure , substance use , mental health , and social support through face-to-face or computer-assisted interviews.
R	Of 104 participants , 68 ( 65.4% ) reported full adherence.
R	Compared with BIY , PIY were younger , had greater HIV disease severity , and had more structural supports.
R	Adjusting for transmission mode ( PIY vs. BIY ) , nonadherence by self-reportwasassociated with higher viral load ( VL ) ( adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.5 , confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 , 2.18 ).
R	Nonadherent adolescents were significantly likely to have had AIDS , discussed HIV disease with providers , reported difficulty with medication routine , experienced internalizing behavior problems , and used drugs.
R	In multivariate analyses , independent predictors of nonadherence included acquiring HIV behaviorally ( AOR = 4.378 , CI = 1.055 , 18.165 ) , ever having AIDS ( AOR = 4.78 , CI = 1.31 , 17.49 ) , perceiving difficult medication routine ( AOR = 1.84 , CI = 1.07 , 3.16 ) , discussing disease indicators with provider ( AOR = 4.57 , CI = 1.74 , 11.98 ) , and missing doses because of forgetting ( AOR = 2.53 , CI = 1.29 , 4.96 ).
R	Adjusting for transmission mode , detectable VL was associated with lower recent CD4( + ) lymphocyte counts , discussing disease indicators with providers , and missing doses because of forgetting or being depressed.
R	Low recent CD4( + ) lymphocyte counts ( AOR = .988 , p = .024 ) but fewer HIV symptoms ( AOR = .466 , p = .032 ) and missing doses because of forgetting ( AOR = 1.76 , p = .05 ) were independently associated with detectable VL in multivariate analysis.
C	Despite differences between groups , nonadherence was associated with severity of illness , difficult medication routine , and forgetfulness.
C	Beyond individual needs , both groups of adolescents had suboptimal adherence and would benefit from simplified medication routines and organizational skills.

B	Florida has the third largest population in the U. S. of persons living with disabilities , making optimizing health outcomes for this population paramount.
B	Though the state has a long-standing and robust program to reduce tobacco use , prevention efforts do not specifically target persons with disabilities.
P	To compare rates of tobacco use behaviors and second hand smoke exposure between adults living with and without disabilities.
M	Secondary analysis of 2007-2009 Florida BRFSS data.
M	The proportions of persons with disabilities who were cigar or cigarette smokers , quit smoking , were exposed to secondhand smoke , or had an interest in calling a Quit Line were compared for persons with and without disabilities.
M	Weighted proportions and accompanying 95% confidence intervals were calculated , with proportions adjusted for age , gender , race , and education.
R	Adult Floridians with a disability were more likely to report being a current cigarette smoker and being exposed to secondhand smoke , yet were also more likely to report quitting smoking for at least one day than were persons without a disability.
R	No differences were found for cigar smoking , age at smoking initiation , or interest in the Quit Line.
C	Findings suggest persons with disability are disproportionately burdened by tobacco use , yet are more likely to attempt to quit , suggesting a need for targeted interventions to assist persons with a disability in smoking cessation and reducing tobacco use and exposure.
C	This has important implications for the future health of a group at greater risk of chronic disease.

B	Abstracts are often used to screen a journal article.
B	Little is known about the reporting quality for abstracts of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in cancer nursing.
P	This study evaluated the quality of abstracts reporting published RCTs in cancer nursing and examined factors contributing to better reporting quality.
M	This is a literature review study.
M	Searches were conducted in PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for English-language RCTs involving cancer nursing.
M	Quality of abstract reporting was assessed and scored based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial statement for Abstracts ( CONSORT for Abstracts ).
M	Descriptive statistics , univariate , and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of better quality of abstracts.
R	A total of 227 eligible articles published between 1984 and 2010 from 68 journals were identified.
R	On average 46% of the items in the CONSORT for Abstracts were reported.
R	More than 80% of the studies addressed only 6 of the 17 items from the CONSORT for Abstracts.
R	Items concerning randomization , blinding , and intent-to-treat analysis were reported by fewer than 30% of the studies.
R	Publication year , word count , impact factor , number of institutes , corresponding author's country , and funding accounted for 31.6% to 33.2% of the variance of the quality of abstracts based on a multiple regression model.
C	The reporting quality score of cancer nursing RCT abstracts was suboptimal.
C	Strategies to improve abstract reporting quality are needed.
C	To ensure that essential RCT information can be reported in the abstract , journal editors may need to reassess word count limits.
B	Assessment of body composition plays a significant role in combating chronic disease among South Asians.
B	Accurate assessment of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) requires population-specific equations which are currently unavailable for urban South Asian women.
P	To assess validity of direct BIA assessment and selected equations for prediction of total body water ( TBW ) , against Deuterium ( ( H2O )-H-2 ) dilution and develop and validate a population-specific TBW equation for urban South Asian women.
M	Data of 80 urban Sri Lankan women ( 30-45 years ) were used for this analysis.
M	Body composition was assessed by ( H2O )-H-2 dilution ( reference ) and BIA.
M	Available BIA equations were assessed for validity.
M	A new TBW equation was generated and validated.
R	Direct BIA measurements and other equations did not meet validation criteria in predicting TBW.
R	TBW by the new equation ( TBW = 3.443 + 0.342 x ( height( 2 )/impedance ) + 0.176 x weight ) correlated ( p<0.001 ) with TBW by reference method.
R	TBW using the new equation was not significantly different ( 25.30 +/- 2.4 kg ) from the reference ( 25.32 +/- 2.7 kg ).
C	Direct use of TBW by instrument and existing equations are less suitable for this population.
C	The new TBW equation is suitable for body composition assessment in urban South Asian women.
P	The purpose of this study was to measure the signal-to-noise ratios in classrooms while class was in session and students were interacting with the teacher and each other.
M	Measurements of noise and reverberation were collected for 5 different classrooms in 3 different schools while class was in session.
M	Activities taking place during the measurements were recorded to compare with sound level measures.
M	The use of infrared classroom amplification was compared with no amplification.
C	The results revealed that when classroom amplification was used , students heard the teacher's voice at a level that was an average of 13 dB above the noise floor as compared to an average of +2 dB above the noise floor without amplification ,
P	The purpose of this clinical forum is to provide a broad survey of up-to-date , evidence-based information about dyslexia that can be readily applied to clinical practice by speech-language pathologists.
P	Topics include ( a ) theoretical and clinical frameworks for understanding dyslexia in relation to other language-based communication disorders , ( b ) the neurobiological basis of dyslexia , ( c ) the current state of dyslexia legislation , ( d ) issues around identification of dyslexia , ( e ) and evidence-based reviews of instruction for reading and writing.
C	Though there have been numerous papers written on the topic of dyslexia , this clinical forum is unique in that it is the only combination of articles to focus on dyslexia with the speech-language pathologist in mind.
B	Lay persons' judgements of the acceptability of the not uncommon practice of ending the life of a damaged neonate have not been studied.
M	A convenience sample of 1635 lay people in France rated how acceptable it would be for a physician to end a neonate's life-by withholding care , withdrawing care , or active euthanasia-in 54 scenarios in which the neonate was diagnosed either with perinatal asphyxia or a genetic abnormality.
M	The scenarios were all combinations of four factors: three levels of maturity or immaturity , three levels of severity of the health problem , three levels of parents' preference concerning prolonging care and two levels of decision-making ( with or without consulting the other caregivers ).
M	Analyses of variance of the participants' responses were performed to determine the importance of each factor ; the interactions among factors , with methods of ending life and with other patient characteristics ; and the differences between asphyxia and genetic abnormality.
M	A cluster analysis was performed to look for groups with different patterns of responses.
R	Lay people assigned most importance to the parents' request and to the severity of the problem.
R	Except for a small group ( 12% ) always opposed to ending life , they used a simple additive-type rule in integrating the information.
C	Most of this sample of French lay people are not categorically for or against ending the life of a damaged neonate , but judge its degree of acceptability by adding up those factors that seem most salient to them.
B	There is compelling evidence that suicide attempts are among the strongest predictors of suicide and future suicide attempts.
P	This study aimed to examine psychopathology in multiple-suicide attempters.
M	We compared the demographic and clinical features of three groups: depressed patients without a history of suicide attempts ( non-attempters ) , depressed patients with a history of one to three suicide attempts ( attempters ) , and depressed patients with a history of four or more suicide attempts ( multiple attempters ).
R	We found that attempters and multiple attempters had higher levels of depression , hopelessness , aggression , hostility , and impulsivity and were more likely to have borderline personality disorder and family history of major depression or alcohol use disorder compared with non-attempters , but did not differ between each other on these measures.
R	Multiple attempters had greater suicidal ideation at study entry and were more likely to have family history of suicide attempt compared with attempters.
R	Importantly , multiple attempters had greater suicide intent at the time of the most medically serious suicide attempt and more serious medical consequences during their most medically serious suicide attempt compared with attempters.
C	The cross-sectional design of the study.
C	Our data suggest that multiple-suicide attempters require careful evaluation as their behavior can have serious medical consequences.
B	Malawi is one of the countries in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa severely affected by the HIV pandemic.
B	This being the case , student nurses' clinical encounters include caring for patients with HIV and AIDS.
P	The study explored the clinical learning experience of undergraduate nursing students in Malawi , with the aim of understanding the nature of their experience.
M	This was a hermeneutic phenomenological study.
M	The study took place at a university nursing college in Malawi.
M	Thirty undergraduate nursing students were purposively selected.
M	Conversational interviews were conducted and a framework developed by modifying Colaizzi's procedural steps guided the phenomenological analysis.
R	The participants reported their experience during the early years of their studies and their current experience at the time of the study , depicting them as novice and senior students respectively.
R	The study findings demonstrated an overt fear of contracting HIV infection among novice nursing students.
R	Such fear led students to deliberately avoid taking care of HIV positive patients and develop a sense of legitimate emotional detachment However , as students progressed in their studies , and their knowledge and experiences increased , they realised that HIV and AIDS patients needed support and empathy.
R	The learning trajectory demonstrate a gradual change from emotional detachment based on fear to a sense of emotional engagement built on knowledge , experiential insights and the notion of emotions management that led to the provision of care driven by compassion as opposed to anxiety.
C	The findings illustrate that nursing students need to work on their emotions to provide compassionate care.
C	This is consistent with the concept of emotional labour and the paper argues that undertaking emotional labour is essential in promoting compassionate care.

B	The aims of the cross-sectional study were to measure the extent of adherence to prescribed medications among patients affected by chronic diseases and to identify the predictors of the adherence.
M	The study was conducted between March and December 2014 among 633 outpatients in four hospitals in Italy.
M	Data were collected using a face to face interview at the time of their visit to the hospital.
M	The Morisky Medication Adherence 4-item Scale was used to measure patients' self-reported adherence.
R	The majority of the patients were male ( 51.7% ) , the mean age was 63.2 years , one-third had at least a high school diploma or equivalent , 34.6% was employed , and the main diseases were hypertension , diabetes , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
R	A total of 39.3% patients reported themselves as being adherent to medications over the 4 weeks preceding their medical specialist's visit.
R	Patients were more likely to adhere to medications if they had a college degree or higher level of education , a higher score of the Katz index , took a lower number of total pills per day , and did not use pill organizers.
R	Patients who have never forgotten to take medications over the 4 weeks preceding their medical specialist's visit were 46.1%.
C	The findings emphasize the need for improving information for the individuals affected by chronic diseases concerning the risks of non-adherence in order to encourage responsible behaviour to prescribed medications.
B	Maternal mortality is higher and skilled attendance at delivery is lower in the slums of Nairobi ( Kenya ) compared to Ouagadougou ( Burkina Faso ).
B	Lower numbers of public health facilities , greater distance to facilities , and higher costs of maternal health services in Nairobi could explain these differences.
P	By comparing the use of maternal health care services among women with similar characteristics in the two cities , we will produce a more nuanced picture of the contextual factors at play.
M	We use birth statistics collected between 2009 and 2011 in all households living in several poor neighborhoods followed by the Nairobi and the Ouagadougou Health and Demographic Surveillances Systems ( n = 3 ,346 and 4 ,239 births ).
M	We compare the socioeconomic characteristics associated with antenatal care ( ANC ) use and deliveries at health facilities , controlling for demographic variables.
R	ANC use is greater in Nairobi than in Ouagadougou for every category of women.
R	In Ouagadougou , there are few differentials in having at least one ANC visit and in delivering at a health facility ; however , differences are observed for completing all four ANC visits.
R	In Nairobi , less-educated , poorer , non-Kikuyu women , and women living in the neighborhood farther from public health services have poorer ANC and deliver more often outside of a health facility.
C	These results suggest that women are more aware of the importance of ANC utilization in Nairobi compared to Ouagadougou.
C	The presence of numerous for-profit health facilities within slums in Nairobi may also help women have all four ANC visits , although the services received may be of substandard quality.
C	In Ouagadougou , the lack of socioeconomic differentials in having at least one ANC visit and in delivering at a health facility suggests that these practices stem from the application of well-enforced maternal health regulations ; however , these regulations do not cover the entire set of four ANC visits.
B	The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) substantially increased rates of insurance coverage within the first year of implementation , including among women of reproductive age.
B	The ACA also requires that private insurance plans cover contraceptives without any out-of-pocket costs.
B	These provisions may have led more women to start using prescription contraception.
M	We conducted two cross-sectional studies , collecting data from 8 ,062 women aged 18 to 39 in the fall 2012 and spring 2015.
M	We examined contraceptive use patterns during both time periods.
M	We used logistic regression to determine whether differences between the two time periods were significant , adjusting for the demographic characteristics of respondents.
R	We observed no changes in contraceptive use patterns among sexually active women.
R	However , use of the pill nearly doubled , from 21% to 40% , among young women aged 18 to 24 who had not had sex in the last month.
R	Many of these women cited benefits of the pill in addition to pregnancy prevention.
C	It may be that the ACA has yet to affect contraceptive use patterns , and it is possible that it will do so in the future , but the evidence thus far suggests the importance of further research into contraceptive access and sources of care.

B	Immigrants are at risk of being obese from obesogenic environments and face factors which limit physical activity and healthy eating.
B	While Hmong immigrants acknowledge the importance of healthy eating and physical activity , to our knowledge no studies have looked at health promoting behaviors among Hmong adolescents with and without disabilities.
P	In this paper , we seek to provide baseline data about physical activity and healthy eating among Hmong high school students with disabilities in Minnesota.
M	We used data from the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey.
M	The study included responses from 1 ,824 Hmong high school students.
M	We compared physical activity and healthy eating of Hmong high school students by disability status.
R	Approximately 13% of Hmong had a disability ( n = 239 ).
R	A greater percentage of Hmong high school students with disabilities reported zero days of 60 min of physical activity ( 20.5% vs 14.8% , p<0.10 ) and zero days participation in sports teams outside of school ( 69.0% vs. 64.3% , p<0.10 ).
R	Compared to Hmong students without disabilities , a significantly lower percentage of Hmong students with disabilities reported not receiving free/reduced lunch ( 66.5% vs 73.1% , p<0.05 ) and significantly more likely to skip meals because their family did not have enough money ( 14.2% vs 9.7% , p<0.05 ).
C	Adolescent Hmong with disabilities encounter both cultural and disability specific factors which could contribute to poorer health promoting behaviors.
C	This study shines light on the need for social policy that promotes disability inclusive , culturally specific health promotion information and advocacy for immigrant youth with disabilities and their families in schools and communities.

B	Research has proposed that writing about stressful events which encompasses disclosing thoughts and feelings concerning a stressful event can lead to improvements in measures of well-being and health.
B	Original studies initiated by James Pennebaker [ Pennebaker and Beall , 1986] have demonstrated that this brief and parsimonious intervention can lead to beneficial effects , while the mechanisms behind these benefits from experimental disclosure are still not clarified.
B	Subjects and
M	The present study investigated whether writing about stressful events would influence long-term measures of mood , depressive symptoms , symptoms following a stressful event , and self-reported health.
M	Furthermore , two possible mechanisms to which benefits might be attributable , namely improvements in self-efficacy or healthy emotion regulation strategies , were examined.
R	The results indicate that writing diminishes hyperarousal and the occurrence of negative affect , but has no effect on the frequency of positive affect , or depressive symptoms.
R	Self-efficacy and the use of different emotion regulation strategies cannot account for observed improvements in stress symptoms , albeit perceived intensity is proved to be a mediator.
C	Expressive writing has more specific effects on coping with stress than supposed in early studies.
B	The Geriatric Anxiety Scale ( GAS ; Segal et al. ( Segal , D. L. , June , A. , Payne , M. , Coolidge , F. L. and Yochim , B. ( 2010 ).
B	Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 24 , 709-714.
B	doi: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.05.002 ) is a self-report measure of anxiety that was designed to address unique issues associated with anxiety assessment in older adults.
B	This study is the first to use item response theory ( IRT ) to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of anxiety in older adults.
M	A large sample of older adults ( n = 581 ; mean age = 72.32 years , SD = 7.64 years , range = 60 to 96 years ; 64% women ; 88% European American ) completed the GAS.
M	IRT properties were examined.
M	The presence of differential item functioning ( DIF ) or measurement bias by age and sex was assessed , and a ten-item short form of the GAS ( called the GAS-10 ) was created.
R	All GAS items had discrimination parameters of 1.07 or greater.
R	Items from the somatic subscale tended to have lower discrimination parameters than items on the cognitive or affective subscales.
R	Two items were flagged for DIF , but the impact of the DIF was negligible.
R	Women scored significantly higher than men on the GAS and its subscales.
R	Participants in the young-old group ( 60 to 79 years old ) scored significantly higher on the cognitive subscale than participants in the old-old group ( 80 years old and older ).
C	Results from the IRT analyses indicated that the GAS and GAS-10 have strong psychometric properties among older adults.
C	We conclude by discussing implications and future research directions.
B	Studies indicate that weight perception among adolescents is associated with weight control , certain risky behaviors , and mental health.
P	The aims of this study were to explore the perception of body size among overweight adolescents and to determine whether they consider it necessary to adjust weight and adopt healthier life habits and associated health-promoting behaviors.
M	A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to investigate a convenience sample of 217 overweight adolescents ( mean body mass index = 27.01kg/m( 2 ) , SD = 3.44 kg/m( 2 ) ) in the Taoyuan County , Taiwan , between January 2005 and December 2006.
R	Results showed that 93% ( 202/217 ) of participants perceived a need to adjust weight.
R	However , only 59.9% ( 121/202 ) took weight-reducing action.
R	Of those who took action , only 32.2% ( 39/121 ) employed "healthy" methods ( including healthier eating and greater exercise ) , with 28.1% ( 34/121 ) focusing on exercise only and 20.7% concentrating on altering eating behavior only.
R	The remaining 19% chose alternative strategies , such as restricting their diet , skipping breakfast , or taking herbs.
R	Adolescents who perceived it necessary to adjust their weight and take appropriate action had higher scores on health promotion practices than those of adolescents who did not.
C	This study provides valuable insight , showing that overweight adolescents , although eager to lose weight , are likely to choose unhealthy methods.
C	School and family health promotion counseling may help encourage overweight adolescents to adopt more healthy habits.
P	The purpose of this research was to develop a scale to measure the life transition process of parents of children with autism , against the backdrop of a lack of research on this topic.
M	Seventy preliminary items were drawn from previous qualitative research , and content validity was tested by three professors as Well as three parents of children with autism.
M	A questionnaire survey was also done between August 2011 and February 2012.
M	Data were collected from 207 parents of children with autism and analyzed using descriptive statistics , item analysis , Cronbach's alpha , Pearson correlation coefficients , and factor analysis with the SPSS Win 15.0 program.
R	Twenty-nine items were selected to constitute the appropriate measuring scale and categorized into 5 factors explaining 63.2% of the total variance.
R	The 5 factors were named ; stages of denial ( 5 items ) , wandering ( 6 items ) , devotion ( 7 items ) , frustration ( 3 items ) , and finally acceptance ( 8 items ).
R	Cronbach's alpha for the 29 items was .80.
C	The results of this study not only suggest assessment criteria for the life transition process of parents who have children with autism but also provide basic directions for program development to provide differentiated support and care at each stage.
B	Mental health problems are often transmitted from one generation to the next.
B	However , transferring knowledge about interventions that reduce intergenerational transmission of disease to the field of parental mental illness has been very difficult.
B	One of the most critical issues in mental health services research is the gap between what is generally known about effective treatment and what is provided to consumers in routine care.
C	In this article we discuss several aspects of knowledge transfer in the field of parental mental illness.
C	Effective strategies and implementation prerequisites are explored , and we also discuss indicators of success and sustainability.
C	Altogether , this article presents a rationale for the importance of preventive strategies for children of mentally ill parents.
C	Furthermore , the discussion shows how complex it is to change clinical practice.
B	There has been increased emphasis globally on nurses' involvement in health policy and systems development.
B	However , there has been limited scholarly attention on nurses' participation in policy-making in South Africa.
P	This paper analyses the dynamics , strengths , and weaknesses of nurses' participation in four national health workforce policies: the 2008 Nursing Strategy , revision of the Scope of Practice for nurses , the new Framework for Nursing Qualifications , and the Occupation-Specific Dispensation ( OSD ) remuneration policy.
M	Using a policy analysis framework , we conducted in-depth interviews with 28 key informants and 73 frontline nurses in four South African provinces.
M	Thematic content analysis was done using the Atlas.ti software.
R	The study found that nurses' participation in policy-making is both contested and complex.
R	The contestation relates to the extent and nature of nurses' participation in nursing policies.
R	There was a disjuncture between nursing leadership and frontline nurses in their levels of awareness of the four policies.
R	The latter group was generally unaware of these policies with the exception of the OSD remuneration policy as it affected them directly.
R	There was also limited consensus on which nursing group legitimately represented nursing issues in the policy arena.
R	Shifting power relationships influenced who participated , how the participation happened , and the degree to which nurses' views and inputs were considered and incorporated.
C	The South African health system presents major opportunities for nurses to influence and direct policies that affect them.
C	This will require a combination of proactive leadership , health policy capacity and skills development among nurses , and strong support from the national nursing association.
B	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Turkey.
B	The emotional effects of this condition are experienced by the women and their families.
P	The aim of the study was to describe the experiences of women with breast cancer and their spouses from diagnosis to treatment completion.
M	This qualitative study with a descriptive qualitative design was conducted at participants' homes.
M	Fourteen women and their spouses were enrolled in the study ( n = 28 ).
M	Data were collected during in-depth interviews and analyzed with inductive content analysis.
R	The women with breast cancer and their spouses' experiences were categorized into 4 main themes: facing breast cancer , treatment process , coping with disease and treatment , and life after treatment.
R	Subthemes were also identified and described.
C	The women with breast cancer and their spouses reported that they had positive and negative experiences in terms of their physical , psychological , and social status from diagnosis to completion of treatment , indicating that breast cancer is a disease of women and a condition of families.
C	Knowledge of these experiences can help nurses plan care that is designed to improve the quality of life of women and their husbands.
B	Oral glucocorticoids ( steroids ) are the mainstay of treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , but their use is often associated with short-and long-term side effects.
B	Following a literature review and discussions with patients with SLE , clinicians , and payers , a need was identified for a comprehensive SLE-specific tool that can be used to evaluate the side effects and benefits of steroids over time from a patient perspective.
B	The objective of this study was to develop a patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) measure to assess general impact ( baseline burden ) , benefits , side effects , and impacts associated with the use of oral steroids in patients with SLE.
M	A qualitative research protocol was developed in which adults with SLE currently receiving or who had received steroids in the past year were recruited from six US rheumatology practices to participate in concept elicitation ( CE ) interviews.
M	The SLE Steroid Questionnaire ( SSQ ) was developed based on CE interview results and clinical input.
M	Cognitive debriefing interviews with a second group of patients with SLE evaluated the content , clarity , and relevance of the items.
M	The SSQ was refined using patient feedback , clinician review , and a translatability assessment.
M	The protocol received central independent review board approval.
R	Thirty-three patients ( 52% moderate disease severity ; 58% currently receiving steroids , mean dose 8.7 mg/day ) completed CE interviews.
R	Patients reported benefits , side effects , and impacts from steroids.
R	The refined SSQ contains 50 items assessing steroid dose/duration ( 4 items ) , general impact ( baseline burden ; 19 items ) , benefits ( 7 items ) , work/productivity ( 3 items ) , side effects ( 10 items ) , emotions ( 6 items ) , and overall satisfaction ( 1 item ).
C	The SSQ is a unique PRO , developed using robust scientific methodology in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration PRO Guidance.
C	It was designed to comprehensively assess the patient experience with steroid therapy and better understand the benefits and burden of steroids for patients with SLE.
B	The aims of this study were to compare clinical characteristics and educational and occupational functioning in two Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) samples recruited respectively from acutely admitted inpatients and public outpatient clinics and to investigate if the two BD samples differed in the same way in education and work ability from the general population.
M	DSM-IV BD patients were consecutively recruited from acute wards throughout Norway ( N = 252 ; 69.8% BD I ; 25.0% BD II ; 5.2% BD NOS ) and from outpatient clinics in the Oslo region ( N = 230 ; 60.4% BD I ; 33.5% BD II ; 6.1% BD NOS ) and demographic and clinical characteristics were compared.
M	A reference sample from the general population ( N = 100 869 ) was used to compare levels of education , marital status and disability benefits.
R	the acute ward sample was older , and had more men , more BD I disorder , more hospitalisations and suicide attempts , longer illness duration , an earlier age of onset and first treatment and used a higher number of antipsychotics , anticonvulsants and lithium than the outpatient sample.
R	Both samples were educated to the same level as their respective reference populations , but received disability benefit and were single to a higher but similar degree.
C	Clinical differences between the BD samples had no consequence for educational achievement and receipt of disability benefit compared to the general population indicating that other factors than severity of illness play a role for education and work abilities in BD patients.

B	Occult injuries are not easily detected and can be potentially life-threatening.
B	The purpose of this study was to quantify the perceived occultness of the most frequent motor vehicle crash injuries according to emergency medical services ( EMS ) professionals.
M	An electronic survey was distributed to 1 ,125 EMS professionals who were asked to quantify the likelihood that first responders would miss symptoms related to a particular injury on a 5-point Likert scale.
M	The Occult Score for each injury was computed from the average of all the survey responses and normalized to be a continuous metric ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 is a non-occult ( highly apparent on initial presentation ) injury and 1 is an occult ( unapparent on initial presentation ) injury.
R	Overall , 110 ,671 survey responses were collected.
R	The Occult Score ranged from 0 to 1 with a mean , median , and standard deviation of 0.443 , 0.450 , and 0.233 , respectively.
R	When comparing the Occult Score of an injury to its corresponding AIS severity , there was 110 relationship between the metrics.
R	When stratifying by body region , injury type , and AIS severity , it was evident that AIS 2-4 abdominal injuries with lacerations , hemorrhage , or contusions were perceived as the most occult injuries.
C	Timely triage is key to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with occult injuries.
C	The Occult Score developed in this study to describe the predictability of an injury in a motor vehicle crash will be used as part of a larger effort , including incorporation into an advanced automatic crash notification ( AACN ) algorithm to detect crash conditions associated with a patient's need for prompt treatment at a trauma center.

B	Disability prevalence estimates are used to identify populations , establish priorities and allocate funding for a broad range of federal , state , and local initiatives.
B	Increasingly , these estimates are based on a set of six questions developed and tested for use in the American Community Survey ( ACS ).
B	A key assumption about the ACS disability screeners is that they sufficiently capture the entire population of people with disabilities , but some studies indicate that certain disability groups are underrepresented.
P	The objective of this study is to explore potential underrepresentation of certain disability groups identified by the ACS disability questions.
M	We compared disability prevalence rates from two data sources for adolescents with disabilities , aged 14 to 16 , who receive Supplemental Security Income ( SSI , n = 2051 ).
M	The Social Security Administration ( SSA ) provided disability determination data for each adolescent , and adolescents ( or proxy-rater ) provided baseline self-report data about functional limitation based on the six ACS disability questions.
R	Approximately 17% of the sample did not endorse any ACS questions.
R	Excluding SSA categories with cell counts less than 10 , the top five conditions not captured by ACS questions included respiratory conditions ( 38% ) , mood disorders ( 28% ) , other mental disorders ( 27% ) , schizophrenic and other psychotic disorders ( 27% ) and developmental disorders ( 20% ).
C	Our findings suggest that people with mental health and developmental disabilities and those with respiratory conditions are among those groups under-represented by the ACS disability questions.
C	Changes or additions to ACS questions should be considered to ensure that all disability groups are addressed in public health planning.

P	Many metropolitan jurisdictions face contests over industrial land because growth in the industrial sector is slow while the office and retail sectors and population grow more rapidly.
P	This article presents a methodology for planning and setting priorities for industrial land use under these circumstances.
P	This article describes an approach to evaluating market demand for industrial land , applied here to Prince George's County , MD , in order to determine which industrial areas could be rezoned to alternate uses without causing major employment and tax losses to the county.
M	I led a team that included an urban planning colleague and graduate students in identifying three types of industrial land: economically healthy industrial districts ; industrially zoned areas where there was evidence of conflict between industry and alternative residential , commercial , and office land uses ; and areas zoned for industry where demand for industrial space and land was weak or nonexistent.
M	The project used data from private data provider CoStar , the U.S. Department of Labor's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages , county zoning maps and tax records , Microsoft Map , and Google Map to assign each industrial district to one of five categories of demand , ranging from weakest ( no history of industrial demand ) to strongest ( economically healthy industrial activity ).
C	Two estimates , one based on the projected absorption rate of industrial land over the next 10 years , and one on the industrial acreage exhibiting evidence of weak demand , both suggest a similarly large surplus of industrial land in the county.
C	Further , rezoning and redeveloping industrial districts in the three weakest demand categories would cause the county to lose little industrial employment.
C	Thus , all analyses reach consistent conclusions that the county should release some industrially zoned land for other uses while protecting some that is essential to the local economy.
C	Takeaway for Practice: This article presents a methodology for assessing industrial areas to determine where industrially zoned land could be rezoned at little loss to the local economy ; where land use conflicts should be addressed with urban design or industrial land protections ; and where industrial areas are economically healthy and important components of the regional economy.
C	Comprehensive plans can improve the health of local economies by identifying districts where industrial activities are strong and essential to the regional economy and encouraging investment in those areas while accommodating and protecting them.
C	Research Support: This research evolved out of two years of work for Prince George's County , MD , by a team from the University of Maryland's urban planning program , supported by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.
P	In this article , the authors report reliability and validity evidence for the Dynamic Evaluation of Motor Speech Skill ( DEMSS ) , a new test that uses dynamic assessment to aid in the differential diagnosis of childhood apraxia of speech ( CAS ).
M	Participants were 81 children between 36 and 79 months of age who were referred to the Mayo Clinic for diagnosis of speech sound disorders.
M	Children were given the DEMSS and a standard speech and language test battery as part of routine evaluations.
M	Subsequently , intrajudge , interjudge , and test-retest reliability were evaluated for a subset of participants.
M	Construct validity was explored for all 81 participants through the use of agglomerative cluster analysis , sensitivity measures , and likelihood ratios.
R	The mean percentage of agreement for 171 judgments was 89% for test-retest reliability , 89% for intrajudge reliability , and 91% for interjudge reliability.
R	Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis showed that total DEMSS scores largely differentiated clusters of children with CAS vs. mild CAS vs. other speech disorders.
R	Positive and negative likelihood ratios and measures of sensitivity and specificity suggested that the DEMSS does not overdiagnose CAS but sometimes fails to identify children with CAS.
C	The value of the DEMSS in differential diagnosis of severe speech impairments was supported on the basis of evidence of reliability and validity.
B	Opioid abuse has become an epidemic in the United States.
B	On August 25 , 2016 , the former Surgeon General of the United States sent an open letter to care providers asking for their help with combatting this growing health crisis.
B	Social media forums like Twitter allow for open discussions among the public and up-to-date exchanges of information about timely topics like opioids.
B	Therefore , the goal of the current study is to identify the public's reactions to the opioid epidemic by identifying the most popular topics tweeted by users.
M	We used a text-miner , algorithmic-driven statistical program to capture 73 ,235 original tweets and retweets posted within a two-month time span ( August 15 , 2016 through October 15 , 2016 ).
M	All tweets contained references to opioids , turnthetide , or similar keywords.
M	We then analyzed the sets of tweets to identify the most prevalent topics.
R	The most discussed topics had to do with public figures addressing opioid abuse , creating better treatment options for teen addicts , using marijuana as an alternative for managing pain , holding foreign and domestic drug makers accountable for the epidemic , promoting the Rx for Change campaign , addressing double-standards in the perceptions and treatment of Black and White opioid users , and advertising opioid recovery programs.
C	Twitter allows users to find current information , voice their concerns , and share calls for action in response to the opioid epidemic.
C	Monitoring the conversations about opioids that are taking place on social media forums like Twitter can help public health officials and care providers better understand how the public is responding to this health crisis.
P	To assess the awareness , facilitators , and barriers to policy implementation related to obesity prevention for primary school children.
M	A cross-sectional study administered using an online questionnaire.
M	Conducted in 447 primary schools in a state in Malaysia.
M	One school administrator from each school served as a participant.
M	The questionnaires consisted of 32 items on awareness , policy implementation , and facilitators and barriers to policy implementation.
M	Descriptive analysis was used to describe the awareness , facilitators , and barriers of policies implementation.
M	Association between schools' characteristics and policy implementation was assessed using logistic regression.
R	The majority ( 90% ) of school administrators were aware of the policies.
R	However , only 50% to 70% of schools had implemented the policies fully.
R	Reported barriers were lack of equipment , insufficient training , and limited time to complete implementation.
R	Facilitators of policy implementation were commitment from the schools , staff members , students , and canteen operators.
R	Policy implementation was comparable in all school types and locality ; except the policy on "Food and Drinks sold at the school canteens" was implemented by more rural schools compared to urban schools ( odds ratio: 1.74 , 95% confidence interval: 1.13-2.69 ).
C	Majority of the school administrators were aware of the existing policies ; however , the implementation was only satisfactory.
C	The identified barriers to policy implementation were modifiable and thus , the stakeholders should consider restrategizing plans in overcoming them.
B	There have been few studies investigating quality of life ( QoL ) in pediatric bipolar disorder ( BD ) patients and none comparing it with that observed in unaffected offspring of parents with BD and healthy controls.
M	The self-report Youth Quality of Life Instrument-Research version ( YQoL-R ) was administered in 26 pediatric BD patients , 17 unaffected offspring of parents with BD , and 24 individuals with no history of DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders.
M	All diagnoses were determined through interviews based on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version.
R	There were statistical differences among the groups for all YQoL-R domains.
R	Pairwise comparisons showed that perceived QoL was significantly worse in the BD group than in the unaffected offspring and healthy subjects , a difference that persisted even when only euthymic subjects were analyzed.
R	There were no significant differences between the unaffected offspring and healthy subjects for any YQoL-R domain.
C	Our sample was small.
C	There was no QoL report from subjects parents nor data about family environment or BD parents' mood state.
C	There is a need for studies to investigate in greater detail the relationship between QoL and psychological resilience , particularly in the unaffected offspring of parents with BD.

B	Poor school performance and low IQ are associated with an increased risk of suicide in males ; it is uncertain whether cognitive performance is a risk factor for suicide in females and whether severe mental illness influences these associations.
M	Record linkage study of Swedish education , population and census data with mortality and inpatient registers.
M	Data were available for 95 ,497 males and 91 ,311 females born in 1972 and 1977 and followed up until 31 December 2005.
R	230 males and 90 females died from suicide over the follow-up period.
R	There were strong inverse associations between school performance at age 16 and subsequent suicide risk in males ( fully adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) per SD increase in school performance score: 0.6( 95% CI 0.6 to 0.7 ; p<0.001 ) ) but not females: adjusted HR.
R	1.1 ( CI 0.9 to 1.4 p = 0.50 ).
R	In males there were almost four fold differences in suicide risk between children in the top and bottom fifths of the range of school grade scores.
R	Similar associations were seen with upper secondary school performance ( age 18/19 years ).
R	There was no strong evidence that deterioration in school performance between ages 16 and 18 was associated with increased suicide risk.
R	Amongst men who developed severe psychiatric illness school performance was not associated with suicide risk.
C	We had limited information on the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorder in cohort members and no data on IQ for the cohort as a whole.
C	Good performance in secondary ( age 16 ) and upper secondary ( age 18 ) school is associated with a reduced risk of suicide in men but not women.
C	This protective effect is not seen amongst those who develop severe psychiatric illness.
C	These differences indicate that the aetiology of suicide differs in males and females and in those with and without severe mental illness.

P	The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate the effects of parent-implemented language interventions on the language skills of children between 18 and 60 months of age with primary and secondary language impairments.
M	A systematic literature search yielded 18 studies that met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
M	Effect sizes for each study were calculated for 7 language outcome variables and analyzed using a random effects model.
M	Separate analyses were conducted for each language outcome and for each comparison group.
M	Outcomes were compared for children with and without intellectual disabilities and for parent report and direct observational language measures.
R	The results indicate that parent-implemented language interventions have a significant , positive impact on receptive and expressive language skills of children with and without intellectual disabilities.
R	Effect sizes ( g ) for child measures ranged from -0.15 to 0.82 depending on the outcome measure and comparison group.
C	The results of this review indicate that parent-implemented language interventions are an effective approach to early language intervention for young children with language impairments.
C	Critical features of parent-implemented interventions are discussed in terms of implications for practice and future research.
B	The role of anxiety in late-life suicidal behavior has received relatively little attention.
B	The aim was to explore the association between anxiety symptoms and suicidal feelings in a population sample of 70-year-olds without dementia , and to test whether associations would be independent of depression.
M	Face-to-face interviews ( N = 560 ) were carried out by psychiatric nurses and past month symptoms were rated with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale ( CPRS ).
M	The Brief Scale for Anxiety ( BSA ) was derived from the CPRS to quantify anxiety symptom burden.
M	Past month suicidal feelings were evaluated with the Paykel questions.
R	Anxiety symptom burden was associated with suicidal feelings and the association remained after adjusting for major depression.
R	One individual BSA item ( Inner tension ) was independently associated with suicidal feelings in a multivariate regression model.
R	The association did not remain , however , in a final model in which depression symptoms replaced depression diagnosis.
C	Results from this population study suggest an association between anxiety and suicidal feelings in older adults.
C	The role of anxiety and depression symptoms needs further clarification in the study of suicidal behavior in late life.
P	In 2008 , the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) and MS Trust conducted a second audit of NHS services for people with MS ( PwMS ).
P	Using the free text comments obtained from the RCP and MS Trust audit , this study aimed to perform content analysis on the views of PwMS about MS services , focussing on physiotherapy provision.
M	A total of 757 PwMS included a free text comment on MS services and an additional 41 commented separately about physiotherapy services.
M	The data were analysed using content analysis , which identified three main themes , positive , negative and neutral and subsequent categories and sub-categories.
M	Intra-and inter-rater reliability were assessed and the data were manipulated to address the research aim.
R	This study found that the majority of the free text comments on MS services were negative ( 55% ).
R	Physiotherapy provision was rated the most negative of NHS services ( 38% ) , with the primary complaints being lack of information about services and excessive waiting times for appointments.
C	This study has revealed that NHS physiotherapy provision is not meeting the needs of PwMS.
B	Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) victims often experience substantial and persistent mental and physical health problems , including increased risk for chronic disease and barriers to healthcare access.
B	This study investigated the association between IPV and cancer screening.
M	Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from the eight states and one U.S. territory that administered the optional IPV module in 2006 were analyzed to examine demographic characteristics , health behaviors , health status , healthcare coverage , use of health services , and cancer screening among men and women who reported IPV victimization compared with those among men and women who did not.
M	IPV victimization included physical violence , threats , and sexual violence.
R	In the nine jurisdictions that administered the IPV module , 23.6% of women and 11.3% of men experienced IPV.
R	Fewer women and men reporting IPV victimization had health insurance , a personal doctor or healthcare provider , or regular checkups within the past 2 years than nonvictims.
R	More male and female IPV victims were current tobacco users and engaged in binge drinking in the past month.
R	IPV victims of both sexes also had poorer health status , lower life satisfaction , less social and emotional support , and more days with poor physical and mental health in the past month than nonvictims.
R	IPV victimization was associated with lower rates of mammography and colorectal cancer screening but not cervical cancer screening in women and was not associated with colorectal cancer screening in men.
R	In multivariable logistic regression results presented as adjusted proportions controlling for demographics , health status , and healthcare access , only the association with mammography screening remained significant , and the magnitude of this association was modest.
C	There were consistent differences between IPV victims and nonvictims in nearly every measure of healthcare access , health status , and preventive service use.
C	Much of this association seems explained by population characteristics associated with both IPV and lower use of preventive service use , including differences in demographic characteristics , health status , and healthcare access.
C	Healthcare providers could take steps to identify populations at high risk for lack of access or use of preventive services and IPV victimization.
P	To examine racial/ethnic differences in dietary intake of women in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ).
M	Cross-sectional study.
M	Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
M	Women 19 to 50 years of age living in WIC-participating households.
M	Nutrient/food group intake from one 24-hour dietary recall.
M	Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between race/ethnicity and nutrient/food group intake.
R	Compared to non-Hispanic white women , Hispanic women had lower dietary energy density ( 1.7 +/- 0.1 vs 2.2 +/- 0.1 kcal/g , P < .001 ) , and better nutrient intake , including more folate ( 429 +/- 20 vs 364 +/- 29 mu g , P = .024 ) , fiber ( 20.1 +/- 0.9 vs 13.6 +/- 0.9 g , P <= .001 ) , and potassium ( 2575 +/- 78 vs 2251 +/- 66 mg , P = .012 ).
R	This may be related to greater consumption of total vegetables ( 1.67 +/- 0.16 vs 1.17 +/- 0.17 cup equivalents [c-eq] , P = .029 ) , including more red and orange vegetables ( 0.64 +/- 0.11 vs 0.32 vs 0.09 c-eq , P = .013 ) and more legumes ( 0.17 +/- 0.04 vs 0.07 +/- 0.02 c-eq , P = .006 ).
R	Both Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women consumed more sodium ( Hispanic: P = .015 ; non-Hispanic black: P = .008 ) , but less added sugars ( Hispanic: P <= .001 ; non-Hispanic black: P = .015 ) , than non-Hispanic white women.
C	These findings highlight differences in dietary intake by race/ethnicity and can inform nutrition messages of WIC nutrition educators and dietitians.
B	Negative employment consequences of arthritis are known but not fully understood.
B	Examining transitions in and out of work can provide valuable information.
P	To examine associations of arthritis with employment during the Great Recession and predictors of employment transitions.
M	Data were for 3 ,277 adults ages 30-62 years with and without arthritis from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey followed in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2008-2009.
M	Employment ( working vs. notworking ) was ascertained at baseline and five follow-ups.
M	We estimated Kaplan Meier survival curves with 95% confidence intervals ( CI ) separately for time to stopping work ( working at baseline ) and starting work ( not working at baseline ) using Cox proportional hazards regression models with hazard ratios ( HR ).
R	Arthritis was significantly associated with greater risk of stopping work ( HR = 1.7 , 95% CI = 1.3-2.2 ; adjusted HR= 1.5 , 95% CI = 1.1-2.0 ) and significantly associated with 40% lower chance of starting work ( HR = 0.6 , 95% CI = 0.4-0.8 ) , which reversed on adjustment ( HR = 1.5 , 95% CI = 1.0-2.2 ).
R	Employment predictors were mixed by outcome.
C	During the Great Recession , adults with arthritis stopped work at higher rates and started work at lower rates than those without arthritis.
P	To strengthen our understanding of the impact of baseline variability in mode choice on the likelihood of travel behaviour change.
M	Quasi-experimental analyses in a cohort study of 450 commuters exposed to a new guided busway with a path for walking and cycling in Cambridge , UK.
M	Exposure to the intervention was defined using the shortest network distance from each participant's home to the busway.
M	Variability in commuter travel behaviour at baseline was defined using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index , the number of different modes of transport used over a week , and the proportion of trips made by the main ( combination of ) mode( s ).
M	The outcomes were changes in the share of commute trips ( i ) involving any active travel , ( ii ) involving any public transport , and ( iii ) made entirely by car.
M	Variability and change data were derived from a self-reported seven-day record collected before ( 2009 ) and after ( 2012 ) the intervention.
M	Separate multinomial regression models were estimated to assess the influence of baseline variability on behaviour change , both independently and as an interaction effect with exposure to the intervention.
R	All three measures of variability predicted changes in mode share in most models.
R	The effect size for the intervention was slightly strengthened after including variability.
R	Commuters with higher baseline variability were more likely to increase their active mode share ( e.g. for HHI: relative risk ratio [RRR] for interaction 334 , 95% CI 1.41 , 7.89 ) and decrease their car mode share in response to the intervention ( e.g. for HHI: RRR 7.50 , 95% CI 2.52 , 22.34 ).
C	People reporting a higher level of variability in mode choice were more likely to change their travel behaviour following an intervention.
C	Future research should consider such variability as a potential predictor and effect modifier of travel and physical activity behaviour change , and its significance for the design and targeting of interventions.

B	While more women with physical disabilities are becoming mothers , many encounter barriers to perinatal care and experience poor outcomes.
B	Little is known about the perinatal care experiences and outcomes of women with physical disabilities in Canada.
P	This qualitative study sought to understand the perinatal care experiences and outcomes of women with physical disabilities in one Canadian province , with an emphasis on identifying barriers to care.
M	In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 women with physical disabilities who had given birth in the last 5 years.
M	Follow-up interviews were conducted with 10 of the 13 participants.
M	All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
M	Data analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach.
R	Based on analysis of participants' interviews , five themes regarding barriers to care were identified: ( 1 ) Inaccessible care settings , ( 2 ) Negative attitudes , ( 3 ) Lack of knowledge and experience , ( 4 ) Lack of communication and collaboration among providers , and ( 5 ) Misunderstandings of disability and disability-related needs.
C	Study findings reveal that the perinatal care system is not set up with women with physical disabilities in mind and that barriers to perinatal care may contribute to poor outcomes.
C	More research and training are needed to address barriers to perinatal care for women with physical disabilities.
C	Collaboration among perinatal and disability-related providers and meaningful inclusion of women with physical disabilities in educational initiatives and care plans are vital to improve care experiences and outcomes.

B	Tanzania , like many developing countries , faces a crisis in human resources for health.
B	The government has looked for ways to increase the number and skills of health workers , including using distance learning in their training.
B	In 2008 , the authors reviewed and assessed the country's current distance learning programmes for health care workers , as well as those in countries with similar human resource challenges , to determine the feasibility of distance learning to meet the need of an increased and more skilled health workforce.
M	Data were collected from 25 distance learning programmes at health training institutions , universities , and non-governmental organizations throughout the country from May to August 2008.
M	Methods included internet research ; desk review ; telephone , email and mail-in surveys ; on-site observations ; interviews with programme managers , instructors , students , information technology specialists , preceptors , health care workers and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare representatives ; and a focus group with national HIV/AIDS care and treatment organizations.
R	Challenges include lack of guidelines for administrators , instructors and preceptors of distance learning programmes regarding roles and responsibilities ; absence of competencies for clinical components of curricula ; and technological constraints such as lack of access to computers and to the internet.
R	Insufficient funding resulted in personnel shortages , lack of appropriate training for personnel , and lack of materials for students.
R	Nonetheless , current and prospective students expressed overwhelming enthusiasm for scale-up of distance learning because of the unique financial and social benefits offered by these programs.
R	Participants were retained as employees in their health care facilities , and remained in their communities and supported their families while advancing their careers.
R	Space in health training institutions was freed up for new students entering in-residence pre-service training.
C	A blended print-based distance learning model is most feasible at the national level due to current resource and infrastructure constraints.
C	With an increase in staffing ; improvement of infrastructure , coordination and curricula ; and decentralization to the zonal or district level , distance learning can be an effective method to increase both the skills and the numbers of qualified health care workers capable of meeting the health care needs of the Tanzanian population.
B	Participants' safety is the primary concern when conducting research with suicidal or potentially suicidal participants.
B	The presence of suicide risk is often an exclusion criterion for research participants.
B	Subsequently , few studies have examined the effects of research assessments on study participants' suicidality.
P	The purpose of this research was to examine the patterns of postassessment changes in self-harm and suicide urges of study participants who were recently discharged from an inpatient psychiatric service.
M	Study participants ( N = 120 ) were recruited from patients with a lifetime history of suicidal behavior admitted with current suicidal ideation or suicide attempt to an inpatient psychiatric service and/or a crisis stabilization unit.
M	Participants were assessed for suicidal ideation with the Suicide Ideation Scale at 1 , 3 , and 6 months following their discharge from hospital.
M	The risk assessment protocol was administered at the start and at the end of each of the study follow-up assessments.
R	Changes in self-harm and suicide urges following study assessments were small , infrequent , and were most likely to reflect a decrease in suicidality.
R	Similarly , participants rarely reported worsening self-control over suicidal urges , and when they did , the effect was minimal.
R	By the end of the 6-month follow-up period , increases in self-harm and suicidal urges postassessment were not seen.
C	The inclusion of suicidal participants in research interviews rarely increased suicide risk.
C	Research involving suicidal individuals is possible when study protocols are well planned and executed by trained assessors and clinicians who are able to identify participants at risk and provide intervention if necessary.
C	The few participants that required intervention had high levels of suicide ideation and behavior at baseline and almost all reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.
C	Further study is needed to better characterize this subgroup of participants.
P	In this series of articles-Research Ethics I , Research Ethics II , and Research Ethics III-the authors provide a comprehensive review of the 9 core domains for the responsible conduct of research ( RCR ) as articulated by the Office of Research Integrity.
M	In Research Ethics III , they review the RCR domains of publication practices and authorship , conflicts of interest , and research misconduct.
M	Whereas the legal definition of research misconduct under federal law pertains mainly to intentional falsification , fabrication , and plagiarism , they discuss a host of research practices that raise ethical concerns.
C	The integrity of the scientific record-its accuracy , completeness , and value-ultimately impacts the health and well-being of society.
C	For this reason , scientists are both entrusted and obligated to use the highest standards possible when proposing , performing , reviewing , and reporting research or when educating and mentoring new investigators.
P	The study was done to develop a shared decision-making scale for end-of-life patients in Korea.
M	The process included construction of a conceptual framework , generation of initial items , verification of content validity , selection of secondary items , preliminary study , and extraction of final items.
M	The participants were 388 adults who lived in one of 3 Korean metropolitan cities: Seoul , Daegu , or Busan.
M	Item analysis , factor analysis , criterion related validity , and internal consistency were used to analyze the data.
M	Data collection was done from July to October 2011.
R	Thirty-four items were selected for the final scale , and categorized into 7 factors explaining 61.9% of the total variance.
R	The factors were labeled as sharing information ( 9 items ) , constructing system ( 7 items ) , explanation as a duty ( 5 items ) , autonomy ( 4 items ) , capturing time ( 3 items ) , participation of family ( 3 items ) , and human respect ( 3 items ).
R	The scores for the scale were significantly correlated among shared decision-making scale , terminating life support scale , and dignified dying scale.
R	Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the 34 items was .94.
C	The above findings indicate that the shared decision-making scale has a good validity and reliability when used for end-of-life patients in Korea.
B	The availability and distribution of an appropriate eye care workforce are fundamental to reaching the goals of "VISION 2020: The right to sight" , the global initiative for the elimination of avoidable blindness launched jointly by the World Health Organization and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness with an international membership of nongovernmental organizations , professional associations , eye care institutions and corporations.
B	Periodic evaluation of these parameters is important in the journey towards achieving these goals.
B	The objectives of the study were to determine the availability and distribution of human resources for eye care delivery in Enugu Urban , south-eastern Nigeria.
M	The study was designed as a cross-sectional descriptive survey , the setting for which was all public and privately owned eye care facilities in Enugu Urban , Enugu State , south-eastern Nigeria , in October 2006.
M	The health map of Enugu Urban and the hospital register of the Public Health Department of the Enugu State Ministry of Health were used to identify the eye health care facilities in Enugu Urban.
M	A structured , pretested , researcher-administered questionnaire was used to capture data on cadre and distribution of the eye care personnel in these facilities.
M	Relevant population data were obtained from the Enugu Regional Office of the National Population Commission.
M	Descriptive statistical analysis was used to generate percentages and proportions.
M	Eye care personnel-to-population ratios were calculated and compared to World Health Organization recommendations.
R	Out of Enugu State's population of three million , Enugu Urban accounts for 22%.
R	The population of Enugu Urban is distributed between the three-component Local Government Areas comprising Enugu North ( 31% ) , Enugu South ( 30% ) and Enugu East ( 39% ).
R	There are 45 eye care facilities ( public: 31 ( 69% ) ; private: 14 ( 31% ) ) employing 252 eye care workers ( public: 226 ( 90% ) ; private: 26 ( 10% ) ) aged 18 to 63 ( mean = 36.1 years , SD = 2 years ) comprising males ( 36: 14% ) and females ( 216: 86% ) , giving a male-to-female sex ratio of 1: 6.
R	The available eye care workforce is unevenly distributed between Enugu North ( 128: 51% ) , Enugu South ( 65: 26% ) and Enugu East ( 59: 23% ) Local Government Areas.
C	Using broad and crude World Health Organization standards for minimum provider-to-population ratios , there is a sufficient eye care workforce in Enugu Urban.
C	However , the maldistribution of the workforce creates a major barrier to uptake of eye care services.
C	Policy modifications could reverse this maldistribution.
P	Promoting a child's healthy growth and development in the first six years of life is critical to their later health and well-being.
P	Indigenous infants experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous infants , yet little is understood about how parents access and use health services to optimize their infants' growth and development.
P	Exploring the experiences of Indigenous mothers who select and use early childhood development ( ECD ) services provides important lessons into how best to promote their access and use of health services.
M	This qualitative interpretive description study was guided by the Two-Eyed Seeing framework and included interviews with 19 Indigenous mothers of infants less than two years of age and 7 providers of ECD services.
R	Mainstream ( public ) and Indigenous-led health promotion programs both promoted the access and use of services while Indigenous-led programs further demonstrated an ability to provide culturally safe and trauma and violence-informed care.
C	Providers of Indigenous-led services are best suited to deliver culturally safe care for Indigenous mothers and infants.
C	Providers of mainstream services , however , supported by government policies and funding , can better meet the needs of Indigenous mothers and infants by providing cultural safe and trauma and violence-informed care.
B	Opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) is one of the major symptoms in palliative care with a prevalence of 30-50%.
B	Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of OIC is significantly more effective than placebo , but only in about fifty percent of the patients regardless of dose increase.
B	Dose increases cause increased toxicity without additional efficacy , and are therefore not recommended.
B	While methylnaltrexone is mu-receptor antagonist , only a few opioids are solely mu-receptor agonists.
B	Therefore , the response to methylnaltrexone may be determined by the receptor-profile of a specific opioid.
B	In addition , methylnaltrexone may also affect the immune system and angiogenesis as was found in pre-clinical studies.
B	Primary aim of this study is to determine differences in the efficacy of methylnaltrexone prescribed to resolve opioid induced constipation between three commonly used opioid subtypes: morphine sulphate , oxycodone and fentanyl.
B	Secondary aim is to explore potential immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic effects of methylnaltrexone.
M	In this multi-center , prospective , parallel group trial we will evaluate the efficacy of methylnaltrexone in resolving OIC occurring as a side effect of the most common opioid subtypes: morphine , oxycodone and fentanyl.
M	In total 195 patients with OIC despite prophylactic laxatives will receive methylnaltrexone every other day up to fourteen days.
M	Patients will report its effect in a laxation diary.
M	Group allocation is based on the opioid type the patient is using.
M	At the start and end of the study period patients complete the Bowel Function Index questionnaire.
M	A subgroup of the patients will donate blood for analysis of immunomodulatory- and anti-angiogenic effects of methylnaltrexone.
C	In this study we aim to determine the efficacy of methylnaltrexone per opioid subtype to reduce constipation.
C	We expect that the outcome of this study will improve the clinical use of methylnaltraxone.
B	Migraine , a common chronic-intermittent disorder of idiopathic origin characterized by severe debilitating headaches and autonomic nervous system dysfunction , and placental abruption , the premature separation of the placenta , share many common pathophysiological characteristics.
B	Moreover , endothelial dysfunction , platelet activation , hypercoagulation , and inflammation are common to both disorders.
B	We assessed risk of placental abruption in relation to maternal history of migraine before and during pregnancy in Peruvian women.
M	Cases were 375 women with pregnancies complicated by placental abruption , and controls were 368 women without an abruption.
M	During in-person interviews conducted following delivery , women were asked if they had physician-diagnosed migraine , and they were asked questions that allowed headaches and migraine to be classified according to criteria established by the International Headache Society.
M	Logistic regression procedures were used to calculate odds ratios ( aOR ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CI ) adjusted for confounders.
R	Overall , a lifetime history of any headaches or migraine was associated with an increased odds of placental abruption ( aOR = 1.60 ; 95% CI 1.16-2.20 ).
R	A lifetime history of migraine was associated with a 2.14-fold increased odds of placental abruption ( aOR = 2.14 ; 95% CI 1.22-3.75 ).
R	The odds of placental abruption was 2.11 ( 95% CI 1.00-4.45 ) for migraineurs without aura ; and 1.59 ( 95% 0.70-3.62 ) for migraineurs with aura.
R	A lifetime history of tension-type headache was also increased with placental abruption ( aOR = 1.61 ; 95% CI 1.01-2.57 ).
C	This study adds placental abruption to a growing list of pregnancy complications associated with maternal headache/migraine disorders.
C	Nevertheless , prospective cohort studies are needed to more rigorously evaluate the extent to which migraines and/or its treatments are associated with the occurrence of placental abruption.
B	Prospective cohort studies recruit relatively healthy population samples , resulting in lower morbidity and mortality rates than in the source population.
B	This is known as the healthy volunteer effect.
B	The aim of this study was to define the magnitude and the development over time of the healthy volunteer effect in the EPIC-NL cohort.
M	We studied mortality rates in the EPIC-NL cohort , which comprises 37 551 men and women aged 20-70 years at recruitment in 1993-97.
M	The date and cause of death of deceased participants until 2010 were obtained through linkage with the municipal registry and Statistics Netherlands.
M	Standardized mortality ratios ( SMRs ) were computed by dividing the observed number of deaths by the number of deaths expected from the general Dutch population.
M	Additionally , standardized incidence ratios were calculated to compare cancer incidence.
R	After an average follow-up of 14.9 years , 3029 deaths were documented.
R	Overall mortality in men [SMR 73.5% , 95% confidence interval ( CI ): 68.1-79.3] and women ( SMR 65.9% , 95% CI: 63.2-68.6 ) was lower compared with the general population for the whole follow-up period.
R	The SMRs clearly increased over the follow-up period.
R	Among women , the SMR was lower for death due to cardiovascular diseases than death due to cancer.
R	Cancer incidence was also lower in EPIC-NL than in the general population ( SMR 78.3 and 82.7% for men and women , respectively ).
C	The results show a healthy volunteer effect in the EPIC-NL cohort , which tapers off with longer follow-up.
C	Therefore , in the first years of follow-up , power might not be sufficient to detect small associations.
P	Diagnostic decision making is influenced by the attributes of assessments.
P	In order to propose time-efficient protocols for screening children's speech , this study aimed to determine whether eliciting imitated responses and analyzing productions in different word positions resulted in different levels of consonant accuracy.
M	Participants were 267 English-speaking preschool-age children in the Sound Start Study whose parents were concerned about their speech.
M	They were assessed using the International Speech Screener: Research Version ( ISS ; McLeod , 2013 ) using either imitated or spontaneous elicitation.
M	Productions were compared with an established diagnostic assessment of speech accuracy ( Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology ; Dodd , Hua , Crosbie , Holm , & Ozanne , 2002 ).
R	Participants' performance on the ISS was significantly correlated with performance on the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology.
R	Eliciting imitated productions on the ISS ( M = 2:18 min , SD = 0:59 min ) took significantly less time than spontaneous productions ( M = 6:32 min , SD = 2:34 min ).
R	There was no significant difference in accuracy of imitated versus spontaneous productions in word-initial position ; however , consonants were significantly less accurate in spontaneous than imitated productions in other word positions.
R	Overall , participants had significantly lower consonant accuracy in word-initial position than within-word or word-final positions.
R	Examination of the influence of word position on test discrimination , using receiver operating characteristic analyses , revealed acceptable test discrimination for percentage of consonants correct across word positions.
C	This research supports using imitated elicitation and analysis of percentage of consonants correct in word-initial position as a time-efficient procedure when screening the speech of English-speaking preschool children.
B	The risk environment framework provides a valuable but under-utilised heuristic for understanding environmental vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers.
B	Brothels have been shown to be safer than street-based sex work , with higher rates of consistent condom use and lower HIV prevalence.
B	While entertainment venues are also assumed to be safer than street-based sex work , few studies have examined environmental influences on vulnerability to HIV in this context.
M	As part of the Young Women's Health Study , a prospective observational study of young women ( 15-29 years ) engaged in sex work in Phnom Penh , we conducted in-depth interviews ( n = 33 ) to explore vulnerability to HIV/STI and related harms.
M	Interviews were conducted in Khmer by trained interviewers , transcribed and translated into English and analysed for thematic content.
R	The intensification of anti-prostitution and anti-trafficking efforts in Cambodia has increased the number of women working in entertainment venues and on the street.
R	Our results confirm that street-based sex work places women at risk of HIV/STI infection and identify significant environmental risks related to entertainment-based sex work , including limited access to condoms and alcohol-related intoxication.
R	Our data also indicate that exposure to violence and interactions with the police are mediated by the settings in which sex is sold.
R	In particular , transacting sex in environments such as guest houses where there is little or no oversight in the form of peer or managerial support or protection , may increase vulnerability to HIV/STI.
C	Entertainment venues may also provide a high risk environment for sex work.
C	Our results indicate that strategies designed to address HIV prevention among brothel-based FSWs in Cambodia have not translated well to street and entertainment-based sex work venues in which increasing numbers of women are working.
C	There is an urgent need for targeted interventions , supported by legal and policy reforms , designed to reduce the environmental risks of sex work in these settings.
C	Future research should seek to investigate sex work venues as risk environments , explore the role of different business models in mediating these environments , and identify and quantify exposure to risk in different occupational settings.
B	To prioritize non-recommended clinical activities in Primary Care ( PC ) , from "Do not do" recommendations listed by the Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Familia y Comunitaria ( Semfyc ) , according to expert consensus ( physicians , nurses and pharmacists ).
B	Methods.
B	The consensus for the prioritization of non-recommended practices in PC was performed through an online procedure.
B	We used as a base the list of "do not-do" recommendations of the SEMFYC.
B	We asked the experts to prioritize practices that should be de-adopted in PC , based on four prioritization criteria: frequency of occurrence , cost of the activity , ease of disposal and damage caused , which were scored from one to five , according to their recommendation.
B	Scores were summarized in median and quartile values.
B	Two rounds were necessary to obtain a consensus.
B	A modified e-Delphi technique was used.
B	Results.
B	34 experts ( 62% ) participated in the first consultation round and prioritized 19 recommendations with a score >= 3.5.
B	These recommendations were again analyzed in a second round , in which 32 panelists agreed to prioritize 17 practices ( 13 related to prescription , three diagnostic tests , and one clinical analysis ).
B	The high priority list included seven practices with values >= 4.1 ) Prescription of a new drug in elderly patients without having reviewed the previous treatments ; 2 ) Lipid-lowering drugs without calculating the overall cardiovascular risk ; 3 ) Not systematically prescribing gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors to patients consuming Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) ; 4 ) Glucose self-analysis in non-insulinized type 2 diabetics ; 5 ) Benzodiazepines in the long term ; 6 ) Bisphosphonates in patients with low risk of fracture ; and 7 ) Antibiotics in lower respiratory tract infections.
B	Conclusion.
B	This study provides information for the prioritization of 17 non-AP activities in which short-term de-adoption would significantly increase the efficiency of the public health system.
B	Person-centred palliative care poses high demands on professionals and patients regarding appropriate and effective communication and informed decision-making.
B	This is even more so for patients with limited health literacy , as they lack the necessary skills to find , understand and apply information about their health and healthcare.
B	Recognizing patients with limited health literacy and adapting the communication , information provision and decision-making process to their skills and needs is essential to achieve desired person-centred palliative care.
B	The aim of this study is to summarize available strategies and tools for healthcare providers towards successful communication , information provision and/or shared decision-making in supporting patients with limited health literacy in hospital-based palliative care in Western countries.
M	A scoping review was conducted.
M	First , databases PubMed , Embase , CINAHL , and PsycINFO were searched.
M	Next , grey literature was examined using several online databases and by contacting national experts.
M	In addition , all references of included studies were checked.
R	Five studies were included that showed that there are face-to-face , written as well as online strategies available for healthcare providers to support communication , information provision and , to a lesser extent , ( shared ) decision-making in palliative care for patients with limited health literacy.
R	Strategies that were mentioned several times were: teach-back method , jargon-free communication and developing and testing materials with patients with limited health literacy , among others.
R	Two supporting tools were found: patient decision aids and question prompt lists.
C	To guarantee high quality person-centred palliative care , the role of health literacy should be considered.
C	Although there are several strategies available for healthcare providers to facilitate such communication , only few tools are offered.
C	Moreover , the strategies and tools appear not specific for the setting of palliative care , but seem helpful for providers to support the communication , information provision and decision making with patients with limited health literacy in general.
C	Future research should focus on which strategies or tools are ( most ) effective in supporting patients with limited health literacy in palliative care , and the implementation of these strategies and tools in practice.
B	Research on children raised by adults with disability is limited.
B	Our goal was to provide a profile of the health and educational status of children raised by a caregiver with disability.
M	In 2007-2008 , 4571 adults completed the North Carolina Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) and Child Health Assessment Monitoring Program ( CHAMP ) surveys.
M	Analyses using weighted data provided population-based health/educational status comparisons of children ( 0 to 17 years old ) raised by caregivers with and without disability.
R	Twenty-three percent of caregivers reported disability.
R	Rates of insurance coverage and preventive care did not differ by caregiver disability status , although children of caregivers with disability were more likely to have publicly funded insurance.
R	The majority of children of caregivers with disability were in excellent/very good health ( 70% ) , healthy weight ( 58% ) , and making above-average grades ( 74% ).
R	Nonetheless , children raised by caregivers with disability appear to be at disproportionately higher risk for overall poorer outcomes.
R	Children raised by caregivers with disability were more likely to be in fair/poor health ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.2 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.6 ) , overweight/obese ( aOR = 1.5 , 95% CI 1.1-2.0 ) , need medical/educational services ( aOR = 2.0 , 95% CI 1.5-2.6 ) , have lower grades ( aOR 1.9 , 95% CI 1.4-2.5 ) , and higher rates of school absenteeism ( aOR = 2.4 ,95% CI 1.8-3.4 ) , compared to children of caregivers without disability.
C	Children raised by a caregiver with disability show good overall wellness ; however , caregiver disability status was found to be associated with an increased risk for poor child health and educational outcomes.
C	Future research is needed to clarify the causes of these disparities and inform policies to alleviate them.

B	Systematic reviews in health professions education may well under-report struggles to synthesize disparate evidence that defies standard quantitative approaches.
B	This paper reports further process analysis in a previously reported systematic review about mobile devices on clinical placements.
P	For a troublesome systematic review: ( 1 ) Analyse further the distribution and reliability of classifying the evidence to Maxwell quality dimensions ( beyond 'Does it work?' )
P	and their overlap with Kirkpatrick K-levels.
P	( 2 ) Analyse how the abstracts represented those dimensions of the evidence-base.
P	( 3 ) Reflect on difficulties in synthesis and merits of Maxwell dimensions.
M	Following integrative synthesis of 45 K2-K4 primary studies ( by combined content-thematic analysis in the pragmatism paradigm ): ( 1 ) Hierarchical cluster analysis explored overlap between Maxwell dimensions and K-levels.
M	Independent and consensus-coding to Maxwell dimensions compared ( using: percentages ; kappa ; McNemar hypothesis-testing ) pre- vs post-discussion and ( 2 ) article abstract vs main body.
M	( 3 ) Narrative summary captured process difficulties and merits.
R	( 1 ) The largest cluster ( five-cluster dendrogram ) was acceptability-accessibility-K1-appropriateness-K3 , with K1 and K4 widely separated.
R	For article main bodies , independent coding agreed most for appropriateness ( good ; adjusted kappa = 0.78 ).
R	Evidence increased significantly pre-post-discussion about acceptability ( p = 0.008 ; 31/45 -> 39/45 ) , accessibility , and equity-ethics-professionalism.
R	( 2 ) Abstracts suggested efficiency significantly less than main bodies evidenced: 31.1% vs 44.4% , p = 0.031.
R	3 ) Challenges and merits emerged for before , during , and after the review.
C	There should be more systematic reporting of process analysis about difficulties synthesizing suboptimal evidence-bases.
C	In this example , Maxwell dimensions were a useful framework beyond K-levels for classifying and synthesizing the evidence-base.
B	Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy that has been shown to enhance the end of life experience.
B	Dignity therapy often involves family carers to support patients weakened by illness and family carers are also the usual recipients of the legacy documents created.
B	No research to date has examined the impact of dignity therapy on family carers at the time of the intervention.
B	This study examined the effects of dignity therapy on family carers of people with motor neurone disease ( MND ).
M	This is a cross-sectional study utilizing a one-group pre-test post-test design with 18 family carers of people diagnosed with MND.
M	Outcomes measured caregiver burden , anxiety , depression , and hopefulness.
M	Acceptability was measured with a questionnaire.
M	Feasibility was assessed by examining family carers' involvement in the therapy sessions , time taken to conduct sessions , and any special accommodations or deviations from the dignity therapy protocol.
R	There were no significant pre-test post-test changes on the group level , but there were decreases in anxiety and depression on the individual level.
R	Baseline measures indicate that 50% of family carers had moderate to severe scores for anxiety prior to dignity therapy.
R	MND family carers saw benefits to the person with MND and to themselves after bereavement , but acceptability of dignity therapy at the time of the intervention was mixed with some family carers indicating it was helpful , some indicating it was harmful , and many expressing ambivalence.
R	Dignity therapy involving MND family carers is feasible and the involvement of family carers has minimal impact on the therapy.
C	Dignity therapy is not likely to alleviate caregiver burden in MND family carers , but it may have the ability to decrease or moderate anxiety and depression in distressed MND family carers.
C	Dignity therapy is feasible and generally acceptable to MND family carers.
C	Dignity therapists may provide a better experience for family carers when they are aware of acceptance levels and the quality of partner relationships.
B	This study applied the Common Sense Model of illness representations to understand the psychological reactions of Indian patients with cancer who report being aware or unaware of their cancer diagnosis.
M	Adult Indian patients with cancer ( N= 329 ) were asked about their understanding of their illness ( to assess awareness of a cancer diagnosis ) , and then completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale.
R	Patients who reported being unaware of their cancer diagnosis ( 54.1% ) experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression.
R	After controlling for awareness , education , income , cancer symptoms , and cancer stage , illness perceptions accounted for significant amounts of variance in anxiety ( Delta R-2 = 0.42 ) and depression ( Delta R-2 = 0.33 ).
R	Illness coherence mediated the relationship between awareness of a cancer diagnosis and anxiety.
R	Moderated regression analyses indicated that several relationships between illness perceptions and anxiety/depression were stronger among patients who reported being unaware of their cancer diagnosis.
C	The Common Sense Model provides a useful framework for explaining the psychological reactions of Indian patients with cancer to their illness , particularly for those who report being unaware of their cancer diagnosis.

B	Chlamydia continues to be the most prevalent disease in the United States.
B	Effective spatial monitoring of chlamydia incidence is important for successful implementation of control and prevention programs.
B	The objective of this study is to apply Bayesian smoothing and exploratory spatial data analysis ( ESDA ) methods to monitor Texas county-level chlamydia incidence rates by examining spatiotemporal patterns.
B	We used county-level data on chlamydia incidence ( for all ages , gender and races ) from the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance ( NETSS ) for 2004 and 2005.
R	Bayesian-smoothed chlamydia incidence rates were spatially dependent both in levels and in relative changes.
R	Erath county had significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher smoothed rates ( > 300 cases per 100 ,000 residents ) than its contiguous neighbors ( 195 or less ) in both years.
R	Gaines county experienced the highest relative increase in smoothed rates ( 173% - 139 to 379 ).
R	The relative change in smoothed chlamydia rates in Newton county was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than its contiguous neighbors.
C	Bayesian smoothing and ESDA methods can assist programs in using chlamydia surveillance data to identify outliers , as well as relevant changes in chlamydia incidence in specific geographic units.
C	Secondly , it may also indirectly help in assessing existing differences and changes in chlamydia surveillance systems over time.
B	A real-time electronic predictive model that identifies hospitalized heart failure ( HF ) patients at high risk for readmission or death may be valuable to clinicians and hospitals who care for these patients.
M	An automated predictive model for 30-day readmission and death was derived and validated from clinical and nonclinical risk factors present on admission in 1372 HF hospitalizations to a major urban hospital between January 2007 and August 2008.
M	Data were extracted from an electronic medical record.
M	The performance of the electronic model was compared with mortality and readmission models developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services ( CMS models ) and a HF mortality model derived from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Registry ( ADHERE model ).
R	The 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 3.1% and 24.1% respectively.
R	The electronic model demonstrated good discrimination for 30 day mortality ( C statistic 0.86 ) and readmission ( C statistic 0.72 ) and performed as well , or better than , the ADHERE model and CMS models for both outcomes ( C statistic ranges: 0.72-0.73 and 0.56-0.66 for mortality and readmissions respectively ; P < 0.05 in all comparisons ).
R	Markers of social instability and lower socioeconomic status improved readmission prediction in the electronic model ( C statistic 0.72 vs. 0.61 , P < 0.05 ).
C	Clinical and social factors available within hours of hospital presentation and extractable from an EMR predicted mortality and readmission at 30 days.
C	Incorporating complex social factors increased the model's accuracy , suggesting that such factors could enhance risk adjustment models designed to compare hospital readmission rates.
B	Nicotine is known to generate oxidative stress through cytochrome P450 2A6 ( CYP2A6 )-mediated metabolism in the liver and other organs , including macrophages.
B	This study has been designed to examine the role of CYP2A6 in nicotine metabolism and oxidative stress in SVGA cells , an immortalized human astrocyte cell line.
M	SVGA astrocytes were treated with 1 mu M nicotine , followed by determination of mRNA and protein levels of several CYPs using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses , respectively.
M	Quantitation of nicotine and the nicotine metabolites , cotinine and nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketones ( NNK ) , was performed using an LC-MS/MS method.
M	The generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was measured using flow cytometry.
R	Nicotine significantly upregulated mRNA and protein expression of the most abundantly expressed CYPs in SVGA astrocytes , CYP2A6 and CYP1A1.
R	To characterize the metabolism of nicotine in astrocytes , a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed which is capable of quantifying very low concentrations of nicotine ( 0.3 ng/mL ) , cotinine and NNK ( 0.11 ng/mL ).
R	The LC-MS/MS results showed that nicotine is steadily metabolized to cotinine and NNK from 0.5 to 4 h. Finally , we showed that nicotine initially causes an increase in ROS formation which is then gradually decreased , perhaps due to the increase in superoxide dismutase level.
R	Nicotine metabolism and ROS formation by CYP2A6 were further confirmed by using tryptamine , a selective inhibitor of CYP2A6 , which significantly lowered the levels of cotinine and NNK and inhibited ROS formation.
C	CYP2A6 plays a key role in nicotine metabolism and oxidative stress in astrocytes , and this has implications in nicotine-associated brain toxicity.

B	Child care institutions ( CCIs ) in Sri Lanka ( SL ) provide residence to over 14 ,000 children.
B	These children have a high risk of developing psychological problems.
B	However , there has been no prior scientific inquiry into mental health issues of institutionalized children in SL.
P	To investigate the emotional and behavioral problems of children living in CCIs in Kandy District , and to explore associated factors.
M	Ten CCIs in Kandy District were selected and all children aged 6-18 years were recruited.
M	Child Behavior Checklist ( 6-18 ) -Sinhala version ( CBCL-S ) was filled by the caregivers , and pertinent problem scores were derived.
M	Relevant socio-demographic data were also collected.
R	A total of 259 children participated.
R	Of them , 66.8 % were female.
R	The mean age was 13.9 years.
R	The average duration in care was 4.3 years.
R	Clinical levels of behavioral problems were found in 14 % of children , whereas 7% were borderline.
R	Externalizing problems like rule-breaking and aggression were more common ( 23.3 % ) than internalizing problems ( 6.6 % ).
R	Male children exhibited more behavioral problems ( p = 0.034 ).
R	Present age , age on admission , duration in care , history of sexual abuse , institutional transfers and frequency of family contact were not associated with behavioral problems.
C	Institutionalized children showing high levels of externalizing problems may be a reflection of disturbed psychosocial development.
C	However , internalizing problems may not be readily recognized , partly due to the shortage of trained caregivers in SL.
C	Educating caregivers to detect and refer children with behavioral problems to psychiatric services is recommended.
P	This study aims to explore the effects of an interactive workshop involving speech-language pathology students on medical students' knowledge about communication in relation to speech-language disorders.
M	Fifty-nine medical students received a lecture about speech-language disorders.
M	Twenty-six of them also participated in a workshop on communication with patients with speech-language disorders.
M	All students completed a 12-item questionnaire exploring knowledge and attitudes towards communication before and after the lecture or the workshop.
M	The results from the two groups' self-ratings of confidence in knowledge were compared with expert-ratings of their ability to choose suitable communicative strategies.
R	Both the lecture and the workshop increased the students' confidence in knowledge about speech-language disorders and how to support communication.
R	Only the workshop group also displayed a statistically significant increase in expert-rated ability and changed their attitude regarding responsibility for the communication in cases of speech-language disorders.
R	There were no statistically significant correlations between the student's own confidence ratings and the experts' ratings of ability.
C	Increased confidence in knowledge from learning is not always reflected in actual knowledge in how to communicate.
C	However , an interactive workshop proved to increase medical students' expert-rated ability and attitudes related to communication in cases of speech-language disorders.
B	Stress and conditioned drug cues have been implicated in the initiation , maintenance and relapse to substances of abuse.
B	Although stress and drug cues are often encountered together , little research exists on whether stress potentiates the response to drug cues.
M	Participants ( N = 75 ) were 39 community recruited individuals with current prescription opioid ( PO ) dependence and 36 healthy controls.
M	Participants stayed overnight in the hospital for one night and then completed laboratory testing the following morning.
M	During laboratory testing , participants were randomly assigned to a stress task ( Trier Social Stress Task ; TSST ) or a no-stress condition.
M	Following the stress manipulation , all participants completed a PO cue paradigm.
M	Immediately before and after the stress and cue tasks , the following were assessed: subjective ( stress , craving , anger , sadness , happiness ) , physiological ( heart rate , blood pressure , galvanic skin response ) , and neuroendocrine responses ( cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone ).
R	Internal validity of the stress task was demonstrated , as evidenced by significantly higher subjective stress , as well as cortisol , heart rate and blood pressure in the TSST compared to the no-stress group.
R	Individuals with PO dependence evidenced significantly greater reactivity to the stress task than controls.
R	Craving increased significantly in response to the drug cue task among PO participants.
R	No stress x cue interaction was observed.
C	In this study , heightened stress reactivity was observed among individuals with PO dependence.
C	Exposure to acute stress , however , did not potentiate craving in response to conditioned drug cues.

P	To describe the intrauterine contraception ( IUC ) adoption process among nulliparous adolescents and to identify the role of the medical provider in this trajectory.
M	We conducted semistructured interviews with a clinic-based sample of 20 nulliparous adolescents ( aged 15-24 years ) with a history of IUC use.
M	Interviews were analyzed using modified grounded theory and cross-case analysis to reveal a process model for IUC adoption , with a focus on the role of the medical provider.
R	The model includes the following stages: first awareness , initial reaction , information gathering , adoption , and adjustment and reassessment.
R	It is influenced by personal preferences and experiences , friends , family , sexual partner( s ) , and medical providers.
R	Interactions with medical providers that study participants found helpful in navigating the adoption process included the use of visuals ; tailored counseling to address specific contraceptive needs ; assurance that IUC discontinuation was an option ; information on a wide range of side effects ; medical provider self-disclosure regarding use of IUC ; and addressing and validating concerns , both before and after IUC insertion.
C	Nulliparous adolescents in this study described a complex IUC adoption process in which the medical provider plays a substantial supportive role.
C	Findings from this study may be used to counsel and support future nulliparous adolescents regarding IUC use.

B	Difficulty in emotion regulation is a hallmark feature of patients with borderline personality disorder ( BPD ).
B	Therefore , change in the frequency of certain patient's coping strategies-aiming at emotion regulation-are among the most promising mechanisms of change in treatments for BPD.
B	In parallel , it was highlighted that therapist responsiveness significantly contributed to outcome across treatment approaches ( Stiles , 2009 ).
B	Based on a randomized controlled trial ( Kramer et al. , 2014 ) , the present process-outcome mediation analysis aims at examining the patient's early change in frequency of coping strategies-in particular the decrease in behavioral forms of coping-as potential mechanism of change in responsive treatments for BPD.
M	A total of 57 patients with BPD were included in the present analysis , out of whom 27 were randomly assigned to a 10-session psychiatric treatment and 30 to a 10-session psychiatric treatment augmented with the responsive intervention of the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship ( Caspar , 2007 ).
M	The 1st , 5th , and 9th session of each therapy were transcribed and analyzed using the Coping Action Pattern Rating Scale ( Perry et al. , 2005 ; 171 sessions analyzed in total ) , a validated observer-rated method for assessing coping strategies in the therapy process.
M	Psychological distress was assessed using the OQ-45 at intake , after Session 5 , and after Session 10.
R	The results confirmed a responsiveness effect associated with the motive-oriented therapeutic relationship and showed a significant decrease in frequency of behavioral forms of coping , F( 1 , 54 ) = 3.09 , p = .05 , d = .56 , which was not different between the 2 conditions.
R	In addition , we demonstrated that the early decrease in behavioral forms of coping between Sessions 1 and 5 partially mediated the link between the group assignment and the change in psychological distress between Sessions 5 and 10.
C	These results shed light on the centrality of therapist responsiveness in treatments for BPD and its impact on very early change in patient's in-session behavioral coping strategies , contributing to the effectiveness of short-term treatments for BPD.
B	Individual and contextual factors jointly participate in the onset and progression of substance abuse ; however , the pattern of their relationship in males and females has not been systematically studied.
P	Male and female children and adolescents were compared to determine the relative influence of individual susceptibility ( neurobehavior disinhibition or ND ) and social environment ( deviancy in peers ) on use of illegal drugs.
M	Boys ( N = 380 ) and girls ( N = 127 ) were prospectively tracked from age 10-12 to age 16 to delineate the role of ND and peer deviancy on use of illegal drugs.
R	Girls exhibited lower ND scores than boys in childhood and were less inclined to affiliate with deviant peers.
R	These differences were reduced or disappeared by mid-adolescence.
R	In boys only , peer deviancy in childhood mediated the association between ND and illegal drug use at age 16.
R	In both genders , peer deviancy in mid-adolescence mediated ND and substance abuse at age 16.
C	Individual and contextual risk factors promoting substance abuse are more salient at a younger age in boys compared to girls.
C	These results point to the need for earlier screening and intervention for boys.
B	Although people with cancer want and need information from their oncologists , patients and oncologists often disagree about what information was discussed during clinical interactions.
B	Most patients have companions present during oncology visits ; we investigated whether companions process information more accurately than patients.
B	Specifically , we examined whether patients and companions differed in agreement with oncologists about what was discussed.
B	We also investigated the effect of topic on agreement and patient/companion self-reported understanding of discussions.
M	Patients with companions were invited to participate on first visits to a cancer center in Detroit , MI.
M	Patients , companions , and oncologists independently completed questionnaires immediately following visits.
M	Participants were asked whether five topics were discussed ( diagnosis , prognosis , metastasis , treatment/treatment goals , and side effects ) and , if discussed , what oncologists said.
M	Participants were also asked to estimate their own and each other's understanding of discussions.
R	A total of 66 patient-companion-oncologist triads participated.
R	Agreement was higher regarding whether topics were discussed than what oncologists said.
R	Agreement did not differ by dyad type.
R	Patients , companions , and oncologists were equally likely to be the source of triadic disagreements.
R	Agreement was high about diagnosis ( >90% ) but much lower about other topics , particularly side effects.
R	Patients and companions reported greater understanding of discussions than oncologists estimated and more accurately estimated each other's understanding than did oncologists.
C	Companions and patients showed similar levels of agreement with oncologists about what they discussed during visits.
C	Interventions are needed to improve communication of information to both patients and companions , especially about particular topics.

B	The needs of a child with an acquired brain injury ( ABI ) are not a scaled down version of those required by an adult with a brain injury who has impairments that impact their cognitive and physical or functional abilities , capacity for work , and/or independence in performing activities of daily living.
P	The purpose of this article is to provide a standardized methodology for analysis of pediatric ABI cases when evaluating vocational potential as part of the child's future rehabilitation or life care planning.
P	PEEDS-RAPEL ( c ) , a case conceptualization model for rehabilitation professionals , is defined in the context of a tool or methodology for the evaluation of pediatric clients with ABI.
P	Issues related to the analysis of a child's needs and impact of a pediatric brain injury for the development of a rehabilitation or life care plan and future earning capacity opinion are reviewed.
C	A case example is provided which illustrates each element of PEEDS-RAPEL ( c ) in providing a pediatric future care and earning capacity opinion.
B	We recently proposed that Lebanon could become a regional 'academic hub' through the repatriation of emigrated Lebanese physicians who would then provide clinical services in the Arab Gulf region on a locum tenens basis.
B	The objectives of this study were to assess the willingness of Lebanese medical graduates practicing in the United States of America to relocate to Lebanon and the Arab Gulf region and to explore the factors associated with this willingness.
M	In 2009 we surveyed Lebanese medical graduates practicing medicine in the United States.
M	The questionnaire included questions about their willingness to relocate to Lebanon and to the Arab Gulf region and the associated timeframes.
M	The questionnaire also included questions about family factors.
M	We linked responders' answers to their personal , educational , and practice characteristics provided by the American Medical Association Physicians' Dataset.
M	We conducted both descriptive and regression analyses.
R	A total of 286 physicians participated in the survey ( 57% response rate ).
R	A majority ( 61% ) was willing to relocate to Lebanon ( 51% possibly , 10% definitely ).
R	A third ( 33% ) were willing to relocate to the Arab Gulf region ( 31% possibly , 2% definitely ).
R	About half ( 54% ) were willing to relocate to Lebanon as a base for clinical missions to the Arab Gulf region ( 49% possibly , 5% definitely ).
R	Willingness to relocate to Lebanon was independently associated with Lebanese citizenship and the birthplace of the spouse being Lebanon , and inversely associated with US citizenship.
R	Willingness to relocate to the Arab Gulf region was independently associated with being board certified , and inversely associated with being married , the age of the oldest child , and practicing in direct patient care.
R	Willingness to relocate to Lebanon as a base was not independently associated with any factor.
C	The findings of this study support the feasibility of the proposal of Lebanon becoming a regional 'academic hub'.
C	Future research should explore other factors important for the feasibility of the proposal as well as actual relocation.
P	Although many studies have reported factors influencing school-age children's health behaviors , most focus on later childhood and early adolescence.
P	It is important to understand children's own perspectives on their health-related behaviors to promote child health.
P	This study identified factors affecting health-related behaviors among younger school-age children via self-report assessments.
M	Participants ( N = 636 ) were children aged 8 to 9 years ( second and third grade ) at six elementary schools in South Korea.
M	The variables examined were child characteristics , health locus of control , perceived parental attention , peer support , school environment , and health-related behaviors.
M	A hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting younger school-age children's health-related behaviors.
R	Socioeconomic status ( family affluence score ) had the strongest impact on health-related behaviors , followed by health locus of control , parental attention , and peer support.
R	Living with both parents also had a positive effect.
R	The present results suggest that children within aged 8 to 9 years have the ability to consciously choose and implement health-related behaviors.
C	Based on these findings , recommendations are as follows: 1 ) collaboration between parents and health professionals , which , given the importance of parental attention , represents the best approach for guiding children's health-related behaviors ; and 2 ) attention paid to children from low-income backgrounds ( at both the school and community levels ) can help prevent health inequalities arising from socioeconomic status.

B	Psychosocial stress among university students , particularly medical students , is considered a widely prevalent problem.
B	There is a need for valid measurement of an adverse psychosocial stress environment in university settings.
B	The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a newly developed short student version of the effort-reward imbalance ( ERI ) questionnaire in a sample of medical students.
M	A cross-sectional survey with a self-administrated questionnaire containing three scales was conducted among 406 medical students.
M	Item-total correlations and Cronbach's alpha were calculated to assess the internal consistency of the scales.
M	Confirmatory factor analysis was applied to test factorial validity of the questionnaire structure.
R	The student version of the ERI questionnaire provides acceptable psychometric properties.
R	The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for effort , reward , and over-commitment were 0.67 , 0.65 , and 0.79 , respectively.
R	Confirmatory factor analysis displayed a satisfactory fit of the data structure with the theoretical concept ( GFI > 0.94 ).
C	This student version of the ERI questionnaire provides a psychometrically tested tool for studies focussing on psychosocial environment in university settings.
C	Further applications of this approach in other student groups are needed , in addition to prospective studies assessing associations with health outcomes.

B	Mental health ( MH ) providers in community-based outpatient clinics ( CBOCs ) are important stakeholders in the development of the Veterans Health Administration ( VA ) telemental health ( TMH ) system , but their perceptions of these technologies have not been systematically examined.
P	The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes of CBOC providers about TMH services , current utilization of these technologies in their clinics , and sources of knowledge regarding TMH.
M	The study employed a mixed-methods design to examine aspects of TMH in CBOCs located in a VA network in the south-central United States.
M	Semistructured , on-site group interviews conducted with 86 CBOC MH providers were followed by in-depth phone surveys with an MH provider identified as a key informant at each of 36 CBOCs in the VA network.
R	The utilization of TMH services varied widely between CBOCs , and the scope of services provided typically focused on delivery of medication management , with little provision of psychological services.
R	Further , several important barriers to expanded use of TMH were identified , including limited education and training and shortage of dedicated space for TMH encounters.
C	General attitudes toward TMH were positive , and most CBOC providers indicated that they would like to expand use of TMH in their clinics.
P	To investigate the effect of hand immersion duration on manipulative ability and tactile sensitivity.
B	Individuals in maritime settings often work with hands that have been immersed in water.
B	Although research has shown that hand immersion duration differentially impacts skin adhesion and tactile sensitivity , the effect of hand immersion on manipulative ability has not been directly tested.
B	Given how critical manipulative ability is for the safety and performance of those working at sea , the effect of hand immersion duration on manual performance was investigated.
M	Tests of manipulative ability ( Purdue Pegboard , Grooved Pegboard , reef knot untying ) and tactile sensitivity ( Touch-Test ) were completed following no-exposure , short-exposure , and long-exposure hand immersions in thermoneutral water.
R	Compared to the no immersion condition , the Purdue Pegboard performance was reduced in both immersion conditions ( short exposure , -11% ; long exposure , -8% ).
R	A performance decrement was only observed in the short exposure condition ( +15% in time to complete task ) for the reef knot untying task.
R	There were no statistical differences in the Grooved Pegboard or Touch-Test scores between exposure conditions.
C	Immersing the hands in water decreases manipulative ability except for when object properties reduce the slipperiness between the hand and object.
C	Manual performance in a wet environment may be conserved by designing tools and objects with edges and textures that can offset the slipperiness of wet hands.
C	To maintain safety , the time requirements for working with wet hands needs to be considered.
B	Fibromyalgia ( FM ) is common in older adults suffering from mood disorders.
B	However , clinical diagnosis of FM is challenging , particularly in psychiatric settings.
B	We examined the prevalence of FM and the sensitivity of three simple screeners for FM.
M	Using cross-sectional data , we evaluated three tests against the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) 1990 Criteria for the Classification of FM: a "Do you often feel like you hurt all over?"
M	question , a pain map score , and the Pope and Hudson ( PH ) interview for FM.
M	Participants were 185 community-dwelling adults >= 60 years old with comorbid depression and chronic low back pain evaluated at a late-life mental health clinic.
R	Fifty three of 185 participants ( 29% ) met the ACR 1990 FM criteria.
R	Compared to those without FM , the FM group had more "yes" answers to the "hurt all over?"
R	question and higher pain map scores.
R	To reach a sensitivity of at least 0.90 , the cut-off score for the pain map was 8.
R	The sensitivity of the pain map , "hurt all over?"
R	question , and PH criteria were 0.92 [95% CI 0.82-0.98] , 0.91 [95% CI 0.79-0.97] , and 0.94 [95% CI 0.843-0.99] respectively.
C	Nearly one in three older adults suffering from depression and chronic low back pain met ACR 1990 FM criteria.
C	Three short screening tests showed high sensitivity when compared to the ACR 1990 FM criteria.
C	Implementation of one of the simple screeners for FM in geriatric psychiatry settings may guide the need for further diagnostic evaluation.
P	The focus of this study was on symptom management to predict quality of life among individuals with heart failure.
P	The theoretical model was constructed based on situation-specific theory of heart failure self-care and literature review.
M	For participants , 241 outpatients at a university hospital were invited to the study from May 19 to July 30 , 2014.
M	Data were collected with structured questionnaires and analyzed using SPSSWIN and AMOS 20.0.
R	The goodness of fit index for the hypothetical model was .93 , incremental fit index , .90 , and comparative fit index , .90.
R	As the outcomes satisfied the recommended level , the hypothetical model appeared to fit the data.
R	Seven of the eight hypotheses selected for the hypothetical model were statistically significant.
R	The predictors of symptom management , symptom management confidence and social support together explained 32% of the variance in quality of life.
R	The 28% of variance in symptom management was explained by symptom recognition , heart failure knowledge and symptom management confidence.
R	The 4% of variance in symptom management confidence was explained by social support.
C	The hypothetical model of this study was confirmed to be adequate in explaining and predicting quality of life among patients with heart failure through symptom management.
C	Effective strategies to improve quality of life among patients with heart failure should focus on symptom management.
C	Symptom management can be enhanced by providing educational programs , encouraging social support and confidence , consequently improving quality of life among this population.
B	Despite the growing interest in the private health sector in low-and middle-income countries , little is known about physicians working outside the public sector.
B	The present work adopts a mixed-methods approach to explore characteristics , working patterns , choices , and motivations of the physicians working exclusively for the private sector in the capital cities of Cape Verde , Guinea Bissau , and Mozambique.
B	The paper's objective is to contribute to the understanding of such physicians , ultimately informing the policies regulating the medical profession in low-and middle-income countries.
M	The qualitative part of the study involved 48 interviews with physicians and health policy-makers and aimed at understanding the practice in the three locations.
M	The quantitative study included a survey of 329 physicians , and multivariate analysis was conducted to analyse characteristics , time allocation , earnings , and motivations of those physicians working only for the private sector , in comparison to their public sector-only and dual practice peers.
R	Our findings showed that only a limited proportion of physicians in the three locations work exclusively for the private sector ( 11.2% ) , with members of this group being older than those practicing only in the public or in both sectors.
R	They were found to work fewer hours per week ( 49 hours ) than their public ( 56 hours ) and dual practice peers ( 62 hours ) ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.011 , respectively ).
R	Their median earnings were USD 4 ,405 per month , with substantial variations across the three locations.
R	Statistically significant differences were found with the earnings of public-only physicians ( P < 0.001 ) , but not with those of the dual practice group ( P = 0.340 ).
R	The qualitative data from the interviews showed private-only physicians' preference for an independent and more flexible work modality , and this was quoted as a determining factor for their choice of sector.
R	This group appears to include those working in the more informal sector , and those who decided to leave the civil service following a disagreement with the public employer.
C	The study shows the importance of understanding the relation between health professionals' characteristics , motivations , and their engagement with the private sector to develop effective policies to regulate the profession.
C	This may ultimately contribute to achieving universal access to medical services in low-and middle-income countries.
B	Over the past two decades the number of people living with cancer has increased.
B	Many cancer survivors end up with long term disabilities requiring ongoing care and support.
B	For many people , cancer survival now means living with a chronic and complex condition.
P	The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the long term management issues for cancer survivors and strategies to enhance their care.
C	Cancer survivors require ongoing support in four key areas: prevention ; surveillance ; intervention for consequences of cancer and its treatment ; and coordination between specialist and generalist providers.
C	Cancer survivors experience significant physical and psychological morbidity which makes minimising their burden of disability and distress an important priority.
C	Survivors require ongoing care that is well co-ordinated , focuses on prevention , provides going surveillance whilst minimising and managing the long term effects of treatment and other co-morbidities.

B	The present study adds to the knowledge base in positive psychology and disability sport psychology by replicating and extending the research of Martin , Byrd , Watts , and Dent ( 2015 ).
P	In the current study we replicated previous findings by predicting life quality and sport engagement using measures of grit , hardiness , and resilience.
P	We also extended the work of Martin et al. ( 2015 ) by examining athlete social support.
M	Eighty-seven adult ( 80 men , 7 women ) wheelchair rugby athletes with various disabilities ( e.g. , amputee ) participated in the current study.
M	They completed questionnaires at rugby tournaments or on-line assessing grit , hardiness , resilience , social support and life satisfaction and sport engagement.
R	Overall , the regression equation predicting life satisfaction was significant , F ( 4 , 81 ) = 9.67 , p < .00 , accounting for thirty-two percent of the variance.
R	One variable , resilience , contributed unique meaningful variance as indicated by its significant beta weight ( beta= 0.46 , p < .001 ).
R	The regression analyses predicting sport engagement was also significant , F ( 4 , 81 ) = 12.08 , p < .001 , and predicted 37% of the variance.
R	Grit ( beta= 0.21 , p < .05 ) , social support ( beta= 0.25 , p < .01 ) , resilience ( beta= 0.23 , p < .05 ) , and hardiness ( beta= 0.27 , p < .05 ) were all significant predictors.
C	Athletes reporting high levels of resilience reported the highest quality of life.
C	Athletes reporting high levels of grit , resilience , hardiness , and social support were the most engaged in their sport.
C	We also partially replicated the work of Martin et al. ( 2015 ).

P	Depression among rural women is a major public health concern.
P	The purpose of this study was to test the competing theories of social causation and social selection to assess the relationship between depression and economic status for a sample of rural , low-income women in the United States.
M	Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from Rural Families Speak , a US Department of Agriculture-funded multi-state , longitudinal study of rural low-income families ( N = 413 ).
R	Results indicated that the social causation theory yielded a better approximation of the relationship between economic status and depression ( RMSEA = 0.50 for a model based on this theory ) than the social selection theory ( RMSEA = 0.067 ).
C	The association between lesser economic status and depressive symptoms is pressing in rural areas , given the high prevalence of both depression and poverty.
C	These findings further emphasize the need for improved mental health services in this vulnerable population.
B	Almost 90% of residents living in long-term care facilities have limited mobility which is associated with a loss of ability in activities of daily living , falls , increased risk of serious medical problems such as pressure ulcers , incontinence and a significant decline in health-related quality of life.
B	For health workers caring for residents it may also increase the risk of injury.
B	The effectiveness of rehabilitation to facilitate mobility has been studied with dedicated research assistants or extensively trained staff caregivers ; however , few investigators have examined the effectiveness of techniques to encourage mobility by usual caregivers in long-term care facilities.
M	This longitudinal , quasi-experimental study is designed to demonstrate the effect of the sit-to-stand activity carried out by residents in the context of daily care with health care aides.
M	In three intervention facilities health care aides will prompt residents to repeat the sit-to-stand action on two separate occasions during each day and each evening shift as part of daily care routines.
M	In three control facilities residents will receive usual care.
M	Intervention and control facilities are matched on the ownership model ( public , private for-profit , voluntary not-for-profit ) and facility size.
M	The dose of the mobility intervention is assessed through the use of daily documentation flowsheets in the health record.
M	Resident outcome measures include: 1 ) the 30-second sit-to-stand test ; 2 ) the Functional Independence Measure ; 3 ) the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 ; and , 4 ) the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease.
C	There are several compelling reasons for this study: the widespread prevalence of limited mobility in this population ; the rapid decline in mobility after admission to a long-term care facility ; the importance of mobility to quality of life ; the increased time ( and therefore cost ) required to care for residents with limited mobility ; and , the increased risk of injury for health workers caring for residents who are unable to stand.
C	The importance of these issues is magnified when considering the increasing number of people living in long-term care facilities and an aging population.
B	Strategic change is needed in hospitals due to external and internal pressures.
B	However , research on strategic change , as a combination of management and medical expertise in hospitals , remains scarce.
P	We analyze how intended strategic issues are processed into deliberate strategies and how unintended strategic issues are processed into emergent strategies in the management of strategy formation in hospitals.
P	This study empirically investigates the integration of medical and management expertise in strategy formation.
M	The longitudinal character of the case study enabled us to track patterns of intended and unintended strategic issues over 2 years.
M	We triangulated data from interviews , observations , and documents.
M	In accordance with the quality standards of qualitative research procedures , we analyzed the data by pattern matching and provided analytical generalization regarding strategy formation in hospitals.
R	Our findings suggest that strategic issues are particularly successful within the strategy formation process if interest groups are concerned with the strategic issue , prospective profits are estimated , and relevant decisions makers are involved early on.
R	Structure and interaction processes require clear criteria and transparent procedures for effective strategy formation.
C	There is systematic neglect of medical expertise in processes of generating strategies.
B	Studies have shown that cannabis intake increases the risk of traffic accidents.
B	Controlled experiments support these findings and have shown a positive dose-effect relationship.
M	In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a roadside survey , we investigated whether a police officer's judgment regarding signs of impairment is related to the concentration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) in the oral fluid ( OF ).
M	We investigated 2 ,632 cases from a representative sample of 3 ,302 Spanish drivers: 253 drivers positive for THC only , 32 positive for THC and ethanol , 201 with only ethanol detected in their breath , and 2 ,146 drivers who tested negative for ethanol in breath and drugs in OF.
M	Recorded data comprised breath alcohol concentrations , THC concentrations in the OF , and the 31 observed signs of impairment.
M	Subject groups were compared using the chi-square test , and logistic regression was used to examine the risk of being categorized as exhibiting signs of impairment.
R	A relationship was found between the OF THC concentration and some observed signs of impairment.
R	Eye signs were noticeable from a THC concentration >3.0 ng/ml in OF , and >25 ng/ml was related to behavior , facial expression , and speech signs.
R	Alcohol and THC contribute to impairment independently and , when taken simultaneously , the effects are comparable to the sum of the effects when consumed separately.
C	The observation of signs of impairment due to cannabis occurs in an OF concentration-related manner but , as a clinical test , OF has low sensitivity and specificity in a random roadside survey.

B	The American Center for Reproductive Medicine's summer internship course in reproductive medicine and research at Cleveland Clinic is a rigorous , results-oriented annual program that began in 2008 to train both local and international students in the fundamentals of scientific research and writing.
B	The foremost goal of the program is to encourage premedical and medical students to aspire toward a career as a physician-scientist.
B	The internship provides participants with an opportunity to engage in original bench research and scientific writing while developing theoretical knowledge and soft skills.
B	This study describes selected survey responses from interns who participated in the 2014 internship program.
B	The objective of these surveys was to elicit the interns' perspective on the internship program , its strengths and weaknesses , and to obtain insight into potential areas for improvement.
M	Questionnaires were structured around the five fundamental aspects of the program: 1 ) theoretical knowledge , 2 ) bench research , 3 ) scientific writing , 4 ) mentorship , and 5 ) soft skills.
M	In addition , an exit survey gathered information on factors that attracted the interns to the program , communication with mentors , and overall impression of the research program.
R	The opportunity to experience hands-on bench research and scientific writing , personalized mentorship , and the reputation of the institution were appreciated and ranked highly among the interns.
R	Nearly 90% of the interns responded that the program was beneficial and well worth the time and effort invested by both interns and faculty.
C	The outcomes portrayed in this study will be useful in the implementation of new programs or refinement of existing medical research training programs.
B	It is challenging to use shared decision-making with patients who have a chronic health condition or , especially , multimorbidity.
B	A patient-goal-oriented approach can thus be beneficial.
B	This study aims to identify and evaluate studies on the effects of interventions that support collaborative goal setting or health priority setting compared to usual care for elderly people with a chronic health condition or multimorbidity.
M	This systematic review was based on EPOC , PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines.
M	Pubmed , PsychInfo , CINAHL , Web of Science , Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched systematically.
M	The following eligibility criteria were applied: 1.
M	Randomised ( cluster ) controlled trials , non-randomised controlled trials , controlled before-after studies , interrupted time series or repeated measures study design ; 2.
M	Single intervention directed specifically at collaborative goal setting or health priority setting or a multifactorial intervention including these elements ; 3.
M	Study population of patients with multimorbidity or at least one chronic disease ( mean age +/- standard deviation ( SD ) incl.
M	age 65 ).
M	4.
M	Studies reporting on outcome measures reducible to outcomes for collaborative goal setting or health priority setting.
R	A narrative analysis was performed.
R	Eight articles describing five unique interventions , including four cluster randomised controlled trials and one randomised controlled trial , were identified.
R	Four intervention studies , representing 904 , 183 , 387 and 1921 patients respectively , were multifactorial and showed statistically significant effects on the application of goal setting ( Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care ( PACIC ) goal setting subscale ) , the number of advance directives or the inclusion of goals in care plans.
R	Explicit attention for goal setting or priority setting by a professional was a common element in these multifactorial interventions.
R	One study , which implemented a single-factor intervention on 322 patients , did not have significant effects on doctor-patient agreement.
R	All the studies had methodological concerns in varying degrees.
C	Collaborative goal setting and/or priority setting can probably best be integrated in complex care interventions.
C	Further research should determine the mix of essential elements in a multifactorial intervention to provide recommendations for daily practice.
C	In addition , the necessity of methodological innovation and the application of mixed evaluation models must be highlighted to deal with the complexity of goal setting and/or priority setting intervention studies.
B	The purpose of this paper was to examine the context of injection drug use in Kabul , Afghanistan among injection drug users ( IDUs ) utilising and not utilising needle and syringe programmes ( NSPs ).
M	Following identification of themes from eight focus group discussions , free-lists were used for further exploration with both NSP using ( n = 30 ) and non-NSP using ( n = 31 ) IDUs.
M	Results All participants were male , had been injecting for 5 years ( mean ) , and most ( 95% ) had been refugees in the past decade.
M	Main reasons for sharing syringes were convenience and lack of availability and did not vary based on NSP use , Drug users perceived alienation from the community , evidenced by names used for drug users by the community which convey social stigma and moral judgment.
M	Health risks were the principal stated risk associated with drug use , which was mentioned more frequently by NSP users.
M	Harm reduction services available in Kabul are perceived to be insufficient for those in need of services , resulting in under utilisation.
M	The limited scope and distribution of services was frequently cited both as an area for improvement among NSP using IDU or as a reason not to use existing programmes.
C	While some positive differences emerged among NSP-using IDU , the current context indicates that both rapid scale-up and increased variety of services , particularly in the realm of addiction treatment , are urgently needed in this setting.

B	Artefact removal from noisy EEG signals is cumbersome , and often requires manual intervention.
B	We tested the performance of an automated method to detect and remove artefacts from EEG recorded during a driving simulation task.
M	Five patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) and five healthy controls were randomly selected from 17 participants undergoing a 40-h extended wakefulness study with 2-hourly 30-minute simulated driving tasks with simultaneous EEG.
M	Two EEG recordings from each individual were studied.
M	EEG data was first processed by independent component analysis ( ICA ).
M	The accuracy of the automated algorithm ( AA ) to detect residual EEG artefact was evaluated against a reference-standard ( RS ) of visually identified artefact-contaminated epochs.
M	EEG spectral power was calculated using 1 ) the RS method , 2 ) the AA , and 3 ) raw data without any artefact rejection ( ICA only ).
R	The algorithm showed good sensitivity ( median: 83.9% ) , excellent specificity ( 91.1% ) , and high accuracy ( 87.0% ) to detect noisy epochs.
R	Cohen's kappa indicated a substantial agreement between the two methods ( 0.72 ).
R	EEG spectral power calculated using the RS and the AA did not differ significantly , while the power of the raw signal was significantly higher than those produced by any artefact rejection method.
R	Increased EEG delta and theta power were significantly correlated with poorer driving performance.
C	These preliminary findings demonstrate an effective automated method to process EEG artefact recorded during driving simulation.
C	This approach may facilitate the routine application of quantitative EEG analyses in future studies and identify new markers of impaired driving performance associated with sleep disorders.
B	Canadian oncology decision-makers have reimbursed cancer drugs at incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICER ) higher than those considered acceptable in other therapeutic areas.
B	Sunitinib is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , indicated for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma ( MRCC ) of clear cell histology.
B	Canadian decision-makers evaluated sunitinib funding in the presence of important data limitations ( including interim analysis of a surrogate outcome ) and in the context of a high ICER.
M	First , a description was presented of the cost-effectiveness analysis submitted for sunitinib reimbursement decision-making in Canada before conclusive survival evidence had been available.
M	Second , sunitinib access decisions and the oncology drug reimbursement literature were reviewed to explore the interpretation of sunitinib perceived value in the context of the decision-making framework in Canada.
R	The economic evaluation yielded an ICER of $144K/quality-adjusted life-year gained for sunitinib compared with interferon-alfa.
R	This high ratio was not an insurmountable barrier to access in Canada because all provinces now reimburse sunitinib for first-line treatment of MRCC.
R	In this particular instance , payers were receptive to immature survival data but substantial progression-free gains , for patients with a relatively rare cancer and few treatment options.
C	This demonstrates that the cost-effectiveness ratio is only one of many factors that affect an access decision in oncology.
B	The aim of this study was to assess the possible association between genetic polymorphisms of the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) gene family and the risk of the development of metabolic syndrome ( MS ) in Zoroastrian females in Yazd , Iran.
M	In this case-control study , GSTM1 , T1 , and P1 polymorphisms were genotyped in 51 randomly selected MS patients and 50 randomly selected healthy controls on February 2014 among Zoroastrian females whose ages ranged from 40 to 70 yr.
M	DNA was extracted from peripheral blood.
M	Data were analyzed with SPSS version 17.
R	We observed a significant association of GSTP1-I/V ( Isoleucine/Valine ) allele and GSTP1-V/V ( Valine / Valine ) allele with MS ( P = 0.047 and P = 0.044 , respectively ).
R	The combined analysis of the two genotypes , the present genotype of GSTT1 , I/V and V/V alleles of GSTP1 genotype demonstrated a decrease in the risk of acquiring MS ( OR = 0.246 , P = 0.031 ).
R	The null genotype of GSTM1 , I/V , and V/V alleles of the GSTP1 genotype showed a lower risk in double combinations ( OR = 0.15 , P = 0.028 and OR = 0.13 , P = 0.013 , respectively ).
R	The combinations of the GSTM1 null genotypes and GSTT1 present genotypes and the GSTP1 I/V and V/V alleles together were associated with decreased risk of having MS in triple combinations ( OR = 0.071 , P = 0.039 and OR = 0.065 , P = 0.022 , respectively ).
C	GSTP1-I/V and V/V alleles , alone or in association with GSTM1 null and GSTT1 present genotypes , are related with decreased susceptibility to the development of MS in Zoroastrian females.
B	The Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) measures general stress and the Swedish version , although used in several studies , has not been extensively evaluated for psychometric properties.
P	This study aimed to investigate psychometric properties and the factor solution of the Swedish 14-item version when used with two samples , namely a mixed Internet sample of women and men ( n = 171 ) and another of women with stress-related disorders ( n = 84 ).
P	Classical test theory , including confirmatory factor analysis , was employed.
R	The factor structure supported a two-factor model for the PSS and confirmed other language versions of the PSS , although one items showed a low item-total correlation.
R	The PSS showed to be feasible with the investigated samples and the results indicated no ceiling or floor effects and good internal consistency of the PSS.
R	Several aspects of construct validity were shown.
R	An association of -0.66 between the PSS and a measure of coping indicated good concurrent validity.
R	Criterion validity was demonstrated through a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.001 ) between the women with stress-related disorders and the Internet sample.
R	Predictive validity of the PSS could be demonstrated in a short-term perspective.
R	Based on the sample with stress-related disorders , sensitivity to change was shown through a statistically significant stress reduction ( P < 0.001 ) from entering work rehabilitation to discharge.
C	The Swedish version of the PSS showed satisfactory psychometric properties and may be recommended for use with people with and without known stress-related disorders.
P	The purpose of the current study is to examine the efficacy of Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving ( CAPS ) in improving caregiver adaptation following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ).
M	In a randomized clinical trial comparing CAPS ( n = 65 ) , an online problem-solving intervention with accompanying Web-based counseling sessions , with an information-based Internet Resource Comparison ( IRC ; n = 67 ) program , participants included families of 12- to17-year-olds who had sustained a TBI in the past 6 months.
M	Linear regression analyses were used to identify main effects and to examine whether caregiver education , race , or prior computer use moderated treatment efficacy.
R	Computer experience moderated postintervention improvements in caregiving self-efficacy following CAPS , Specifically , parents in CAPS with low levels of prior use reporting the greatest improvements.
R	CAPS participants who completed 5 or more sessions reported greater reductions in depression than did the IRC ; however , the groups did not differ on global distress.
R	Conclusions/
C	Findings support the potential utility of counselor-supported Web-based interventions particularly for individuals with limited computer expertise following adolescent TBI.
B	The EQ-5D is a health-related quality of life instrument which provides a simple descriptive health profile and a single index value for health status.
B	The latest version , the EQ-5D-5L , has been translated into more than one hundred languages worldwide - including Thai.
B	This study aims to assess the measurement properties of the Thai version of the EQ-5D-5L ( the 5L ) compared to the EQ-5D-3L ( the 3L ).
M	A total of 117 diabetes patients treated with insulin completed a questionnaire including the 3L and the 5L.
M	The 3L and 5L were compared in terms of distribution , ceiling , convergent validity , discriminative power , test-retest reliability , feasibility , and patient preference.
M	Convergent validity was tested by assessing the relationship between each dimension of the EQ-5D and SF-36v2 using Spearman's rank-order correlation.
M	Discriminative power was determined by the Shannon index ( H' ) and Shannon's Evenness index ( J' ).
M	The test-retest reliability was assessed by examining the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) and Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient.
R	No inconsistent response was found.
R	The 5L trended towards a slightly lower ceiling compared with the 3L ( 33% versus 29% ).
R	Regarding redistribution , 69% to 100% of the patients answering level 2 with the 3L version redistributed their responses to level 2 with the 5L version while about 9% to 22% redistributed their responses to level 3 with the 5L version.
R	The Shannon index ( H' ) improved with the 5L while the Shannon's Evenness index ( J' ) reduced slightly.
R	Convergent validity and test-retest reliability was confirmed for both 3L and 5L.
C	Evidence supported the convergent validity and test-retest reliability of both the 3L and 5L in diabetes patients.
C	However , the 5L is more promising compared to the 3L in terms of a lower ceiling , more discriminatory power , and higher preference by the respondents.
C	Thus , the 5L should be recommended as a preferred health-related quality of life measure in Thailand.
P	The Rural Medical Scholars Program ( RMSP ) was created to increase production of rural family physicians in Alabama.
P	Literature review reveals reasons medical students choose careers in family medicine , and these reasons can be categorized into domains that medical schools can address through admission , curriculum , and structural interventions.
P	We examine whether admission factors can predict family medicine specialty choice among students recruited from rural Alabama.
M	We developed a questionnaire to study the ability of admission factors to predict family medicine specialty choice among Rural Medical Scholars ( RMS ).
M	Eighty RMS graduates were surveyed by mail and 64 ( 80% ) responded.
R	Student characteristics of humanitarian outlook with commitment to rural or underserved populations , family medicine decision or intention made before or at medical school admission , and community influence were positive associations with RMS choosing family medicine residencies ; shadowing in an urban hospital was a negative association.
C	Statements of interest , intentions , plans , and decisions regarding family medicine should be elicited at the time of RMSP admission interview.
C	Strong attachment to home community and commitment to serving and living in a rural area are also important.
C	Students whose introduction to medicine was informed through shadowing or observing in urban hospitals should be considered less likely to become family physicians.
C	Larger sample size studies are needed to assess the role of gender , race , marital status , size of rural town , and MCAT score of candidates in affecting residency choices of students selected for this rural medical education track.
B	Given the significance of documentation and information transfer in the healthcare system as well as new technological options , there is a need for continuously modifying and enhancing the pension insurance's rehabilitation discharge report while taking into account the benefits and expenses associated with it.
B	Among the regular discharge report recipients/users are general practitioners , medical specialists , sociomedical consultants of the German pension insurance and other health-care providers and funding agencies ( e.g. , statutory health insurance , federal labour agency ) , external socio-medical consultants , judges in charge of social legislation issues , pension insurance administrators , and rehabilitation quality assurance officials.
B	In the context of a broader project on the optimisation of the pension insurance's rehabilitation discharge report , the specific needs and interests of its recipients/users as well as suggestions concerning the improvement of structure and content of the discharge report were assessed.
M	Discharge report recipients/users were asked via questionnaire to indicate how frequently they use certain information from the report for their work.
M	They were also asked to state objections/areas of concern and suggestions for improvement.
R	400 recipients/users filled in the questionnaire.
R	More than half of the respondents considered the discharge report too long.
R	Suggestions for shortening the report centred on avoiding redundancies and including standardised response items instead of free text passages.
R	User groups differed with regard to the content that should be subject to reductions.
C	The non-representative sample notwithstanding , the survey's results have rendered important starting points for optimising the statutory pension insurance's discharge report.
B	Many definitions of successful aging ( SA ) exist in the absence of an established consensus definition.
B	There are few examples of a priori application of SA models in real world contexts using external validation procedures.
B	The current study aims to establish the predictive validity of an a priori , continuous model of SA with respect to service utilization.
M	Individuals ( n = 740 ; 64.2% female ) aged 65 years and over ( mean 75.9 ; SD 6.2 ) , randomly selected from general practitioner registries in five sites across the United Kingdom included in the second and third combined screen and assessment waves of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study ( MRC CFAS ; a longitudinal population-based cohort study ) comprised the baseline and two-year follow-up in the current study.
M	A Successful Aging Index ( SAI ) was created using items identified by systematic reviews of operational definitions and lay perspectives of SA , capturing physiological and psychosocial components.
M	Demographic data and SAI components were collected at baseline.
M	Outcome measures , i.e. health service use , informal care use , and functional service , were captured at two years follow-up.
R	Logistic regression revealed significant relationships between the SAI and six of eight service use outcomes in models adjusted for age , sex , education , and socio-economic status.
R	Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve demonstrated sufficient predictive capabilities for all models , ( range 0.65-0.86 ).
C	The SAI demonstrated a strong association , and predictive accuracy , with respect to service use , providing preliminary support for the practical utility and usefulness of this measure.
B	Atopic dermatitis is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease.
B	Although mercury has been suggested as a risk factor , the underlying mechanism and the relationship between mercury and atopic dermatitis remains unclear.
B	The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between mercury exposure and the presence of atopic dermatitis in early childhood.
M	This study is part of the prospective Mothers and Children's Environmental Health cohort study.
M	A total of 1 ,751 pregnant women were enrolled in Mothers and Children's Environmental Health.
M	After delivery , children were followed up.
M	Blood samples were collected and mothers were asked about the presence of atopic dermatitis in their children via a questionnaire at 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , and 60 months of age.
R	After excluding participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria , a total of 1 ,061 mother-children pairs were included in the analysis.
R	The geometric mean of mercury concentrations in cord blood was 5.1 mu g/L.
R	In adjusted models , cord blood mercury exposure ( odds ratio [OR] - 1.1 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 1.0 , 1.2 at 12-24 months ) and postnatal mercury exposure ( OR - 1.2 ; 95% CI = 1.0 ,1.5 at 24-36 months , OR = 1.4 ; 95% CI = 1.1 , 1.8 at 48-60 months ) were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in children.
C	Postnatal mercury exposure at 24 months of age increases the risk of atopic dermatitis in children.
B	Opioid overdose is a major cause of mortality , but injury and fatal outcomes can be prevented by timely administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone.
B	Pre-provision of naloxone to opioid users and family members ( take-home naloxone , THN ) was first proposed in 1996 , and WHO Guidelines were issued in 2014.
B	While widespread in some countries , THN is minimally available or absent elsewhere.
B	This review traces the development of THN over twenty years , from speculative harm reduction proposal to public health strategy.
M	Medline and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed literature ( 1990-2016 ) using Boolean queries: 1 ) "naloxone OR Narcan" ; 2 ) "( opioid OR opiate ) AND overdose AND prevention".
M	Grey literature and specialist websites were also searched.
M	Data were extracted and synthesized as narrative review , with key events presented as chronological timeline.
R	Results are presented in 5-year intervals , starting with the original proposal and THN pilots from 1996 to 2001.
R	Lack of familiarity with THN challenged early distribution schemes ( 2001-2006 ) , leading to further testing , evaluation , and assessment of challenges and perceived medicolegal barriers.
R	From 2006-2011 , response to social and legal concerns led to the expansion of THN programs ; followed by high-impact research and efforts to widen THN availability from 2011 to 2016.
C	Framed as a public health tool for harm reduction , THN has overcome social , clinical , and legal barriers in many jurisdictions.
C	Nonetheless , the rising death toll of opioid overdose illustrates that current THN coverage is insufficient , and greater public investment in overdose prevention will be required if THN is to achieve its full potential impact.
B	This study investigates the relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) symptoms and cigarette smoking , alcohol use and illicit drug use.
R	Of the total sample , 5.4% met screening criteria for ADHD.
R	Smoking , alcohol and illicit drug use were significantly related to ADHD symptoms.
R	In addition , the number of different illicit drugs consumed was significantly higher among the ADHD symptomatic than the nonsymptomatic participants , including the illicit use of sedatives.
R	The main distinguishing illicit drug substances were lysergic acid diethylamide ( odds ratio or OR = 8.0 ) , cocaine ( OR = 7.5 ) , mushrooms ( OR = 7.1 ) and amphetamines ( OR = 6.5 ).
R	Logistic multiple regressions showed that after controlling for gender and school grade , ADHD symptoms predicted smoking , alcohol use and illicit drug use independent of anxiety , depression and antiestablishment attitudes.
R	In addition , poly-substance use was linearly and incrementally related to ADHD symptoms with a large effect size.
C	The findings underscore the vulnerability of young persons with ADHD symptoms to smoking , alcohol and illicit drug use , possibly as a means of self-medication , and emphasize a need for early identification and treatment to reduce the risk of escalation.
B	Cigarette pack health warning labels can elicit negative emotions among smokers , yet little is known about how these negative emotions influence behavior change.
P	Guided by psychological theories emphasizing the role of emotions on risk concern and behavior change , we investigated whether smokers who reported stronger negative emotional responses when viewing warnings reported stronger responses to warnings in daily life and were more likely to try to quit at follow-up.
M	We analyzed data from 5439 adult smokers from Australia , Canada , Mexico , and the US , who were surveyed every four months from September 2012 to September 2014.
M	Participants were shown warnings already implemented on packs in their country and reported negative emotional responses ( i.e. , fear , disgust , worry ) , which were averaged ( range = 1 to 9 ).
M	Country-stratified logistic and linear generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the effect of negative emotional responses on self-reported responses to warnings in daily life ( i.e. , attention , risk concern , avoidance of warnings , forgoing planned cigarettes ) and quit attempts at follow-up.
M	Models were adjusted for socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics , survey wave , and the number of prior surveys answered.
R	Smokers who reported stronger negative emotions were more likely to make quit attempts at follow-up ( Adjusted ORs ranged from 1.09 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.14] to 1.17 [95% CI 1.12 to 1.23] ; p < .001 ) than those who reported lower negative emotions.
R	This relationship was mediated through attention to warnings and behavioral responses to warnings.
R	There was no significant interaction of negative emotions with self-efficacy or nicotine dependence.
C	Negative emotions elicited by warnings encourage behavior change , promoting attention to warnings and behavioral responses that positively predict quit attempts.
B	Gambling facilitates the development of psychopathological problems in some gamblers.
B	Rapid and easy detection of the presence of these problems , or the risk of their development , will allow early action at the beginning of the problem , including preventive action.
B	For this purpose , we developed the "Sistema de Cribado de Riesgo de Problemas de Juegos" ( SCRI-PJ [Risk of Gambling Problems Screening System] ) , an on-line instrument for the detection of people who have , or may develop , gambling problems.
B	The goal of this work is to present and validate the SCRI-PJ.
M	85 people with gambling problems undergoing treatment and 119 people from the general population were assessed with the SCRI-PJ and the DSM-RT Diagnostic Criteria for Pathological Gambling questionnaire.
R	The SCRI-PJ showed high internal consistency ( alpha = .96 ) , sensitivity ( 94.2% ) specificity ( 91.4% ) , with a negative predictive value of 98.6%.
C	The SCRI-PJ is a brief and effective screening instrument to detect people with gambling problems or who are at risk of developing them.
P	Clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) can improve clinical care but uptake and application are inconsistent.
P	Objectives were: to examine temporal trends in clinicians' evaluations of , endorsements of , and intentions to use cancer CPGs developed by an established CPG program ; and to evaluate how predictor variables ( clinician characteristics , beliefs , and attitudes ) are associated with these trends.
M	Between 1999 and 2005 , 756 clinicians evaluated 84 Cancer Care Ontario CPGs , yielding 4 ,091 surveys that targeted four CPG quality domains ( rigour , applicability , acceptability , and comparative value ) , clinicians' endorsement levels , and clinicians' intentions to use CPGs in practice.
R	Time: In contrast to the applicability and intention to use in practice scores , there were small but statistically significant annual net gains in ratings for rigour , acceptability , comparative value , and CPG endorsement measures ( p < 0.05 for all rating categories ).
R	Predictors: In 17 comparisons , ratings were significantly higher among clinicians having the most favourable beliefs and most positive attitudes and lowest for those having the least favourable beliefs and most negative attitudes ( p < 0.05 ).
R	Interactions Time x Predictors: Over time , differences in outcomes among clinicians decreased due to positive net gains in scores by clinicians whose beliefs and attitudes were least favorable.
C	Individual differences among clinicians largely explain variances in outcomes measured.
C	Continued engagement of clinicians least receptive to CPGs may be worthwhile because they are the ones showing most significant gains in CPG quality ratings , endorsement ratings , and intentions to use in practice ratings.
B	In Germany , it is forbidden by law to physically punish children or to harm them mentally.
B	Breaking these rules can result in severe health problems for the children.
B	Home visiting programmes for families with young children are aimed at supporting young families who are facing large social problems , and at enhancing the chances of their children to grow up in a healthy way.
B	Maps showing the regional distribution of the need for these home visiting programmes could be an important tool for local health policy planning.
B	They could help to focus the resources on those families who are in greatest need.
M	The method proposed here for developing such a regional map is based on the following steps: ( a ) search for data that indicate the potential for child neglect , maltreatment or abuse , and that are available for each zip code in the city of Munich , Germany ; ( b ) based on these data , calculation of a summary score that could indicate high need for these home visits ; ( c ) grouping of the zip code areas according to this score ; ( d ) presentation of the regional distribution in a map.
R	After inspecting different data sources , we could identify 5 variables that could indicate the need for these home visits and that are available for each zip code: index of purchasing power , percentage of the population with low education , percentage of the population with migration background , percentage of single mothers , percentage of new-borns with low birth weight ( <2 500 g ).
R	If  ,high need is defined as  ,upper quintile of at least 3 among the 5 variables listed above , about 1 087 newborn babies would have to be visited per year ( i. e. , 10% of all newborn infants in Munich ).
C	These home visits should be as little stigmatising as possible , and especially those families should be reached that are in greatest need.
C	If it is not possible to reach all families in the community , it can be recommended to focus on city districts with a high percentage of families in greatest need.
C	As far as we know , this is the first scientifically based method for such a definition of city districts.
C	The method proposed here could serve as starting point , and it would be important to develop it further.
C	It is very flexible , though , and it can easily be transferred to other cities or districts.
P	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the underlying constructs of the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children Who Stutter ( KiddyCAT ; Vanryckeghem & Brutten , 2007 ) , especially those related to awareness of stuttering and negative speech-associated attitudes.
M	Participants were 114 preschool-age children who stutter ( CWS ; n = 52 ; 15 females ) and children who do not stutter ( CWNS ; n = 62 ; 31 females ).
M	Their scores on the KiddyCAT were assessed to determine whether they differed with respect to talker group ( CWS vs. CWNS ) , chronological age , younger versus older age groups , and gender.
M	A categorical data principal components factor analysis ( CATPCA ) assessed the quantity and quality of the KiddyCAT dimensions.
R	Findings indicated that preschool-age CWS scored significantly higher than CWNS on the KiddyCAT , regardless of age or gender.
R	Additionally , the extraction of a single factor from the CATPCA indicated that one dimension speech difficulty appears to underlie the KiddyCAT items.
C	As reported by its test developers , the KiddyCAT differentiates between CWS and CWNS.
C	Furthermore , one factor , which appears related to participants' attitudes towards speech difficulty , underlies the questionnaire.
C	Findings were taken to suggest that children's responses to the KiddyCAT are related to their perception that speech is difficult , which , for CWS , may be associated with relatively frequent experiences with their speaking difficulties ( i.e. , stuttering ).
C	Learning outcomes: After reading this article , the reader will be able to: ( 1 ) Better understand the concepts of attitude and awareness ; ( 2 ) compare historical views with more recent empirical findings regarding preschool-age CWS' attitudes/awareness towards their stuttering ; ( 3 ) describe the underlying dimension of the KiddyCAT questionnaire ; ( 4 ) interpret KiddyCAT results and describe implications of those results.

B	Our purpose was to assess the direct and indirect contribution of childhood socio-economic conditions to educational differences in leisure-time physical activity among women and men.
M	Population-based data were derived from a representative sample of Finns aged >= 30 years ( N = 7112 ) as part of Health 2000 Survey.
M	Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied.
M	Leisure-time physical activity was divided into inactivity , moderate and high activity.
R	Childhood socio-economic conditions had both a direct and indirect effect through adulthood socio-economic conditions on educational differences in leisure-time physical activity.
R	The direct effect of childhood socio-economic conditions on educational differences in inactivity was stronger than its indirect effects through adulthood socio-economic conditions and other health behaviours and related factors.
R	Adulthood socio-economic conditions had a considerable indirect effect on educational differences in leisure-time physical activity through other adulthood health behaviours and related factors among men.
C	In order to narrow educational differences in leisure-time physical activity , we should secure a childhood environment that enables a physically active lifestyle , support leisure-time physical activity in diverse occupational groups , guarantee equal physical activity possibilities across different educational careers and support those with insufficient material resources.
B	Early detection is important for reducing mortality by colorectal cancer.
B	Workplaces have access to a large number of people , approximately half of the Korean population.
B	For cancer prevention , it is necessary to approach cancer screening through the workplace.
P	In this cross-sectional study , we aimed to identify colorectal cancer screening ( CRCS ) stages and to predict factors that affect the respective stages.
M	Data were collected from 314 manual workers at 32 medium-sized and small workplaces located in Korea.
M	The dependent variable was the stage of CRCS , and independent variables were intrapersonal , interpersonal , and organizational levels.
R	At the intrapersonal level , workers who increased work hours per week or who felt stress were less likely to be in the acting/maintenance stage than in the decided to act stage of CRCS.
R	At the organizational level , workers in medium-sized workplaces , those whose administrators secured health checkup and cancer screening budget for their workplace , and those considering health checkup and cancer screening were more likely to be in the acting/maintenance stage , compared with the decided to act stage.
C	Our findings suggest that the respective stages are affected by different intrapersonal , interpersonal , and organizational factors.
C	Implication for Practice: The workplace environment and organizational predictors before the implementation of CRCS promotion programs may produce better results.
B	Curriculum design and specific topic selection for on-site practical courses in clinical disciplines with limited teaching time is challenging.
B	An electronic learning supported curriculum based on the flipped classroom principle has a high potential to effectively gain knowledge and education along with improving practical experience.
B	Here , we demonstrate the introduction of a flipped classroom curriculum for practical courses in Otorhinolaryngology ( ORL ) in real world practice to improve the on-site time management and students' experience.
M	Educational aims of our practical curriculum were analysed and rearranged into a flipped classroom ( FC ) framework.
M	Core knowledge was taught preliminary based on a moodle platform in predominantly interactive formats.
M	Two quasi-randomized groups were formed with 212 participants either receiving or not receiving access to the e-learning program to reduce a potential allocation bias to the e-learning group.
M	All students completed a questionnaire with learning related items.
M	Focusing the study on the intervention group , we investigated if students using the flipped classroom more often felt better prepared for the practical course.
R	The online learning platform was highly accepted and frequently used by 66% of participating students in the e-learning group.
R	Students with frequent use of our e-learning platform significantly felt better prepared for the practical course ( p = 0.001 ).
R	The far majority of all students supports the idea of further development of e-learning.
R	More than 70% were generally interested in ORL.
R	Handouts were the overall most important learning resource and more than 50% relied solely on them.
C	Flipped classroom curricula can save time and help improving the on-site experience in practical courses especially in smaller surgical disciplines.
C	The acceptance of digital learning is high , and most students rely on handouts for learning ORL , emphasizing the need for guidance by the teacher e.g. through electronic learning.
C	Our results underline the high potential of FC to address teaching challenges for smaller medical disciplines with limited teaching time like ORL.
B	Telerehabilitation may be a feasible solution to the current problems faced by people with Parkinson's disease in accessing speech pathology services.
P	To investigate the validity and reliability of online delivery of the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment ( LSVT ( R ) ) for the speech and voice disorder associated with Parkinson's disease.
M	Thirty-four participants with Parkinson's disease and mild-to-moderate hypokinetic dysarthria took part in the randomized controlled non-inferiority laboratory trial and received the LSVT ( R ) in either the online or the face-to-face environment.
M	Online sessions were conducted via two personal computer-based videoconferencing systems with real-time and store-and-forward capabilities operating on a 128 kbit/s Internet connection.
M	Participants were assessed pre- and post-treatment on acoustic measures of mean vocal sound pressure level , phonation time , maximum fundamental frequency range , and perceptual measures of voice , articulatory precision and speech intelligibility.
R	Non-inferiority of the online LSVT ( R ) modality was confirmed for the primary outcome measure of mean change in sound pressure level on a monologue task.
R	Additionally , non-significant main effects for the LSVT ( R ) environment , dysarthria severity , and interaction effects were obtained for all outcomes measures.
R	Significant improvements following the LSVT ( R ) were also noted on the majority of measures.
R	The LSVT ( R ) was successfully delivered online , although some networking difficulties were encountered on a few occasions.
R	High participant satisfaction was reported overall.
C	Online treatment for hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease appears to be clinically valid and reliable.
C	Suggestions for future research are outlined.
B	Adults engaging in non-suicidal self-injurious ( NSI ) behaviors often report the use of substances ; however , little research explores the relationship between substance abuse and NSI.
B	Thus , this study examined the influence of substance use on patterns of NSI among adults.
P	This study seeks to answer the following questions: ( a ) Is AOD use predictive of more frequent self-injurious behaviors?
P	and ( b ) Does the use of AODs predict injuring more severely than expected?
M	An observational cross-sectional design was used to examine the relationship between drug use and NSI behaviors.
M	Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk ( Mturk ).
R	Results indicated opiates , barbiturates and sedatives all had a small but statistically significant influence on the frequency of NSI behaviors , while marijuana , PCP and anti-anxiety medications had a small but statistically significant relationship to severity.
C	This study indicates that future research should take into account substance use patterns in adults engaging in NSI behaviors.
B	Community-level associations between pain clinics and drug-related outcomes have not been empirically demonstrated.
M	To explore these associations we correlated overdose death rates , hospital-discharge rates for drug-related hospitalizations including neonatal abstinence syndrome , and emergency department rates for drug-related visits with registered pain clinic density and rate of opioid pills dispensed per person at the county-level Florida in 2009.
M	Negative binomial regression was used to model the crude associations and associations adjusted for exposure measures and county demographic characteristics.
R	An estimated 732 pain clinics operated in Florida in 2009 , a rate of 3.9/100 ,000 people.
R	Among the 67 counties in Florida , 23( 34.3% ) had no pain clinics , and three had 90 or more.
R	Adjusted negative binomial regression determined no significant association between pain clinic rate and drug-related outcomes.
R	However , rates of drug-caused , opioid-caused , and oxycodone-caused death correlated significantly with rates of opioid and oxycodone pills dispensed per person in adjusted analyses.
R	For every increase of one pill in the rate of oxycodone pills per person , there was a 6% increase in the rate of oxycodone-related overdose death.
C	Although pain clinics , some of which are "pill mills ," are clearly a source of drugs used nonmedically , their impact on health outcomes might be difficult to quantify because the pills they prescribe might be consumed in other counties or states.
C	The impact of "pill mill" laws might be better measured by more proximal measures such as the number of such facilities.

B	Observational studies have shown that attentional bias for smoking-related cues is associated with increased craving and relapse.
B	Laboratory experiments have shown that manipulating attentional bias may change craving.
B	Interventions to reduce attentional bias could reduce relapse in smokers seeking to quit.
B	We report a clinical trial of attentional retraining in treatment-seeking smokers.
M	This was a double-blind randomised controlled trial that took place in UK smoking cessation clinics.
M	Smokers interested in quitting were randomised to five weekly sessions of attentional retraining ( N = 60 ) or placebo training ( N = 58 ) using a modified visual probe task from one week prior to quit day.
M	Both groups received 21 mg nicotine patches ( from quit day onwards ) and behavioural support.
M	Primary outcomes included change in attentional bias reaction times four weeks after quit day on the visual probe task and craving measured weekly using the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale.
M	Secondary outcomes were changes in withdrawal symptoms , time to first lapse and prolonged abstinence.
R	No attentional bias towards smoking cues was found in the sample at baseline ( mean difference = 3 ms , 95% CI = -2 , 9 ).
R	Post-training bias was not significantly lower in the retraining group compared with the placebo group ( mean difference = -9 ms , 95% CI = -20 , 2 ).
R	There was no difference between groups in change in craving ( p = 0.89 ) and prolonged abstinence at four weeks ( risk ratio = 1.00 , 95% CI = 0.70 , 1.43 ).
C	Taken with one other trial , there appears to be no effect from clinic-based attentional retraining using the visual probe task.
C	Attentional retraining conducted out of clinic may prove more effective.

B	HIV prevention trials conducted among disadvantaged vulnerable at-risk populations in developing countries present unique ethical dilemmas.
B	A key concern in bioethics is the validity of informed consent for trial participation obtained from research subjects in such settings.
B	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a continuous informed consent process adopted during the MDP301 phase III vaginal microbicide trial in Mwanza , Tanzania.
M	A total of 1146 women at increased risk of HIV acquisition working as alcohol and food vendors or in bars , restaurants , hotels and guesthouses have been recruited into the MDP301 phase III efficacy and safety trial in Mwanza.
M	During preparations for the trial , participatory community research methods were used to develop a locally-appropriate pictorial flipchart in order to convey key messages about the trial to potential participants.
M	Pre-recorded audio tapes were also developed to facilitate understanding and compliance with gel-use instructions.
M	A comprehension checklist is administered by clinical staff to all participants at screening , enrolment , 12 , 24 , 40 and 50 week follow-up visits during the trial.
M	To investigate women's perceptions and experiences of the trial , including how well participants internalize and retain key messages provided through a continuous informed consent process , a random sub-sample of 102 women were invited to participate in in-depth interviews ( IDIs ) conducted immediately after their 4 , 24 and 52 week follow-up visits.
R	99 women completed interviews at 4-weeks , 83 at 24-weeks , and 74 at 52 weeks ( a total of 256 interviews ).
R	In all interviews there was evidence of good comprehension and retention of key trial messages including that the gel is not currently know to be effective against HIV ; that this is the key reason for conducting the trial ; and that women should stop using gel in the event of pregnancy.
C	Providing information to trial participants in a focussed , locally-appropriate manner , using methods developed in consultation with the community , and within a continuous informed-consent framework resulted in high levels of comprehension and message retention in this setting.
C	This approach may represent a model for researchers conducting HIV prevention trials among other vulnerable populations in resource-poor settings.
B	India is witnessing a rising burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
B	India's National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes , Cancer , Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke recommends population-based screening and referral to primary health centre for diagnosis confirmation and treatment initiation.
B	However , little is known about uptake of confirmatory tests among screen positives.
P	To estimate the uptake of confirmatory tests and identify the reasons for not undergoing confirmation by those at high risk for developing diabetes.
M	We analysed data collected under project UDAY , a comprehensive diabetes and hypertension prevention and management programme , being implemented in rural Andhra Pradesh , India.
M	Under UDAY , population-based screening for diabetes was carried out by project health workers using a diabetes risk score and capillary blood glucose test.
M	Participants at high risk for diabetes were asked to undergo confirmatory tests.
M	On follow-up visit , health workers assessed if the participant had undergone confirmation and ask for reasons if not so.
R	Of the 35 ,475 eligible adults screened between April 2015 and August 2016 , 10 ,960 ( 31% ) were determined to be at high risk.
R	Among those at high risk , 9670 ( 88% ) were followed up , and of those , only 616 ( 6% ) underwent confirmation.
R	Of those who underwent confirmation , ` lack of symptoms of diabetes warranting visit to health facility' ( 52% ) and ` being at high risk was not necessary enough to visit' ( 41% ) were the most commonly reported reasons for non-confirmation.
R	Inconvenient facility time ( 4.4% ) , no nearby facility ( 3.2% ) , un-affordability ( 2.2% ) and long waiting time ( 1.6% ) were the common health system-related factors that affected the uptake of the confirmatory test.
C	Confirmation of diabetes was abysmally low in the study population.
C	Low uptake of the confirmatory test might be due to low ` risk perception'.
C	The uptake can be increased by improving the population risk perception through individual and/or community-focused risk communication interventions.
B	To address changing dietary patterns and declining dietary quality in indigenous communities , there is growing interest in implementing interventions that promote nutrient-dense , culturally important foods.
P	To describe formative research and an ongoing collaborative process to design a multilevel nutrition intervention Neqa Elicarvigmun or the Fish-to-School ( F2S ) Program that reconnects students to their local food system in a remote Yup'ik community in Western Alaska.
M	Qualitative data that explored the connection between salmon and well-being were collected and collaboratively reviewed with a community work group and analyzed using thematic analysis.
M	Findings were used to co-design the nutrition intervention.
M	Lessons Learned: Formative research findings and ongoing collaboration between academic and community partners informed the final intervention design.
C	Because people's behaviors and interactions with culturally significant foods are embedded in cultural perceptions and local contexts , it is important for nutrition interventions to address local perceptions of these foods.
B	Permanent disability ( PD ) is a major social and economic burden.
B	The aim of this study was to determine the burden of disease due to PD.
M	Using data from the Continuous Working Life Sample ( CWLS ) -a random sample consisting of 4% of the active members affiliated to the Social Security ( SS ) System in Spain ( 1.1 million members ) which data come from administrative registries from the SS- the diagnosis of PD ( 2009-2012 ) was established from the information on the temporary sickness absence ( TSA ) episodes from 2009.
M	The diagnoses were imputed if two criteria were fulfilled: long duration of TSA and short period of time between the TSA episode and PD.
M	The burden of disease was estimated for cases with an established diagnosis of PD by using the potential years of working life lost ( PYWLL ) , estimated as the difference between the legal retirement age ( 65 years ) and the age at the start of a PD.
R	In the CWLS , 163 ,135 ( 13.6%9 individuals suffered a TSA episode in 2009 , out of which 4 ,738 were granted a PD pension in the period of 2009-2012.
R	The diagnosis was established for 3 ,073 ( 64.9% ) cases.
R	A large percentage of PD was produced by musculoskeletal ( 27.4% ) and mental disorders ( 11.6% ) , likewise these diagnoses produced more PYWLL due to a PD: 11 ,086 ( 26.5% ) and 7 ,052 ( 16.9% ) , respectively.
R	Mental disorders produced PD at younger ages ( median= 49 years of age ).
C	Mental and musculoskeletal disorders represent a major burden of disease produced by PD and measured by PYWLL.
C	The diagnoses of PD should become available in order to estimate with more accuracy the PYWLL produced by PD and specific diagnoses.
B	Sorting mail into racks for postmen is visually demanding work.
B	This can result in backward inclination of their heads , especially more pronounced for those who use progressive addition lenses.
P	To evaluate the effects of customized working spectacles on the physical workload of postmen.
M	Twelve male postmen sorted mail on two occasions: once using their private progressive spectacles and once using customized sorting spectacles with inverted progressive lenses.
M	Postures and movements of the head , upper back , neck , and upper arms were measured by inclinometry.
M	The muscular load of the trapezius was measured by surface electromyography.
R	With the customized sorting spectacles , both the backward inclination of the head and backward flexion of the neck were reduced ( 3 degrees ) , as well as the muscular load of the right upper trapezius , compared to sorting with private spectacles.
R	However , with the sorting spectacles , there was a tendency for increased neck forward flexion , and increased sorting time.
C	The reduction in work load may reduce the risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders due to the positive reduction of the backward inclination of the head.
C	But the tendency for increased neck forward flexion may reduce the positive effects.
C	However , the magnitude of the possible reduction is difficult to predict , especially since quantitative data on exposure-response relationships are unknown.
C	Alternative working spectacles with inverted near progressive lenses ought to be evaluated.
C	They should still result in a positive reduced backward inclination of the head and may not cause any increased forward flexion.
P	This study evaluated the accuracy of an experimental version of the Bilingual English Spanish Oral Screener ( BESOS ; Pena , Bedore , Iglesias , Gutierrez-Clellen , & Goldstein , 2008 ) for predicting the long-term risk for language impairment ( LI ) for a matched group of preschool-aged Spanish-English bilingual children with and without LI.
M	A total of 1 ,029 Spanish-English bilingual children completed the BESOS before entering kindergarten.
M	A subset of 167 participants completed a follow-up language evaluation in 1st grade.
M	Twenty-one of these children were identified as having LI and were matched to a group of 21 typically developing peers from the larger sample.
M	A series of discriminant analyses were used to determine the combination of scores on the BESOS that most accurately predicted 2 years later which children presented with and without LI.
R	The linear combination of the semantics and morphosyntax scores in the best language resulted in predictive sensitivity of 95.2% and predictive specificity of 71.4% , with an overall accuracy of 81% for predicting risk for LI.
C	A bilingual language screener administered before kindergarten can be useful for predicting risk for LI in bilingual children in 1st grade.
B	Community corrections populations are a high-risk group who carry multiple suicide risk factors.
P	To identify factors correlated with historical suicide attempts and ideation among African-American men , African-American women , White men , and White women in a community corrections population.
M	Self-report data from 18 ,753 enrollees in community corrections were analyzed.
M	Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between historical suicidal ideation and attempts among the four demographic groups.
R	Participants with historical suicide attempts tended to be younger , White , female , be taking psychotropic medication , have a history of physical or sexual abuse , and meet criteria for dependence on alcohol , amphetamines , cocaine , opioids , or sedatives.
R	Five variables were commonly associated with suicide attempts for all four race/gender groups: younger age , being on disability or retirement , taking psychotropic medication , history of sexual or physical abuse , and cocaine dependence.
R	Other demographic variables had race or gender specificities as risk factors for suicide attempts.
C	Participants had high rates of historical suicide attempts with unique correlates differentiating attempters from ideators among different racial and gender groups.
C	Cocaine dependence was universal predictor of suicide attempts , while other substance dependencies show specific racial and gender profiles associated with suicide attempts.
B	Responding to health crises overseas can be both rewarding and distressing for staff involved.
P	We interviewed UK staff involved in the 2014/15 Ebola response to identify experiences that positively or negatively affected them.
M	We conducted qualitative telephone interviews with 30 Public Health England ( PHE ) staff and 21 non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) staff who had deployed to West Africa.
R	The main motivations for deploying were for moral reasons and personal development.
R	Families were largely supportive of deployment , although family tension was apparent.
R	Pre-deployment training was largely viewed positively.
R	Common stressors included dealing with death and suffering as well as concerns about contagion , while uplifting aspects included seeing patients improve and receiving thanks from community members.
R	Communications with home were largely satisfactory , although participants commonly self-censored their communication.
R	Inter-organisational tensions caused stress , particularly for PHE staff hosted by NGOs.
R	After deployment , loss of motivation and being avoided by friends and family were common.
C	Highlighting the personal benefits arising from deployments , as well as their moral value , may help to increase volunteering.
C	Efforts to improve the support given to responders should focus on identifying how to better support families , preparing all staff members for dealing with death and the risk of contagion , providing opportunities for staff to more frequently experience the uplifting aspects of deployment , resolving inter-organisational difficulties , and educating others about the low risk posed by responders on their return.
B	Health plans in the United States are struggling to contain rapid growth in their spending on medications.
B	They have responded by implementing multi-tiered formularies , which label certain brand medications 'non-preferred' and require higher patient copayments for those medications.
B	This multi-tier policy relies on patients' willingness to switch medications in response to copayment differentials.
B	The antidepressant class has certain characteristics that may pose problems for implementation of three-tier formularies , such as differences in which medication works for which patient , and high rates of medication discontinuation.
P	To measure the effect of a three-tier formulary on antidepressant utilization and spending , including decomposing spending allocations between patient and plan.
M	We use claims and eligibility files for a large , mature nonprofit managed care organization that started introducing its three-tier formulary on January 1 , 2000 , with a staggered implementation across employer groups.
M	The sample includes 109 ,686 individuals who were continuously enrolled members during the study period.
M	We use a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design that includes a comparison group , comprising members whose employer had not adopted three-tier as of March 1 , 2000.
M	This permits some control for potentially confounding changes that could have coincided with three-tier implementation.
R	For the antidepressants that became nonpreferred , prescriptions per enrollee decreased 11% in the three-tier group and increased 5% in the comparison group.
R	The own-copay elasticity of demand for nonpreferred drugs can be approximated as -0.11.
R	Difference-in-differences regression finds that the three-tier formulary slowed the growth in the probability of using antidepressants in the post-period , which was 0.3 percentage points lower than it would have been without three-tier.
R	The three-tier formulary also increased out-of-pocket payments while reducing plan payments and total spending.
C	The results indicate that the plan enrollees were somewhat responsive to the changed incentives , shifting away from the drugs that became nonpreferred.
C	However , the intervention also resulted in cost-shifting from plan to enrollees , indicating some price-inelasticity.
C	The reduction in the proportion of enrollees filling any prescriptions contrasts with results of prior studies for non-psychotropic drug classes.
C	Limitations include the possibility of confounding changes coinciding with three-tier implementation ( if they affected the two groups difterentially ) ; restriction to continuous enrollees ; and lack of data on rebates the plan paid to drug manufacturers.
C	Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: The results of this study suggest that the impact of the three-tier formulary approach may be somewhat different for antidepressants than for some other classes.
C	Implications for Health Policy: Policymakers should monitor the effects of three-tier programs on utilization in psychotropic medication classes.
C	Future studies should seek to understand the reasons for patients' limited response to the change in incentives , perhaps using physician and/or patient surveys.
C	Studies should also examine the effects of three-tier programs on patient adherence , quality of care , and clinical and economic outcomes.
B	We present a formal age-period-cohort analysis to examine if the recent increase in past-year marijuana use among the young is specific to the younger generation or if , instead , it is part of a general increase present across cohorts of all ages.
B	This is the first age-period-cohort analysis of past-year marijuana use that includes adult trends from 2001 to 09.
M	Data come from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health , a series of annual , nationally representative , cross-sectional surveys of the U.S. civilian , non-institutionalized population.
M	The analysis focuses on the 25 year time span from 1985 to 2009 and uses the recently developed 'intrinsic estimator' algorithm to estimate independent effects of age , period , and cohort.
R	The recent increase in past-year marijuana use is not unique to the youngest birth cohorts.
R	An independent , positive influence of cohort membership on past-year marijuana use , net of historical period and age effects , is smaller for today's youngest cohorts than it was for the cohorts that came immediately before , and , in fact , is at its lowest level in three decades.
R	The recent increase in marijuana use among the young is more consistent with a historical period effect that has acted across all cohorts.
R	Period and cohort trends differ substantially for Hispanics.
C	The major forces that drive trends in past-year marijuana use are moving away from cohort-specific factors and toward broad-based influences that affect cohorts of all ages.
C	Strategic public health and policy efforts aimed at addressing the recent increase in past-year marijuana use should do the same.

B	Evidence indicates that being a victim of bullying or peer aggression has negative short- and long-term consequences.
B	In this study , we investigated the mediating and moderating role of two types of attributional mechanisms ( hostile and self-blaming attributions ) on childrens maladjustment ( externalizing and internalizing problems ).
M	In total , 478 children participated in this longitudinal study from grade 5 to grade 7.
M	Children , parents , and teachers repeatedly completed questionnaires.
M	Peer victimization was assessed through peer reports ( T1 ).
M	Attributions were assessed through self-reports using hypothetical scenarios ( T2 ).
M	Parents and teachers reported on childrens maladjustment ( T1 and T3 ).
R	Peer victimization predicted increases in externalizing and internalizing problems.
R	Hostile attributions partially mediated the impact of victimization on increases in externalizing problems.
R	Self-blame was not associated with peer victimization.
R	However , for children with higher levels of self-blaming attributions , peer victimization was linked more strongly with increases in internalizing problems.
C	Results imply that hostile attributions may operate as a potential mechanism through which negative experiences with peers lead to increases in childrens aggressive and delinquent behavior , whereas self-blame exacerbates victimizations effects on internalizing problems.
B	Mortality has been shown to increase with extremely hot ambient temperatures.
B	Details on the specific cause of mortality can be useful for improving preventive policies.
B	Infants are often identified as a population that is vulnerable to extreme heat conditions ; however , information on heat and infant mortality is scarce , with no studies reporting on cause-specific mortality.
M	The study includes all deaths in the Catalonia region of Spain during the warm seasons of 1983-2006 ( 503 ,389 deaths ).
M	We used the case-crossover design to evaluate the association between the occurrence of extremely hot days ( days with maximum temperature above the 95th percentile ) and mortality.
M	Total mortality and infant mortality were stratified into 66 and 8 causes of death , respectively.
R	Three consecutive hot days increased total daily mortality by 19%.
R	We calculated that 1.6% of all deaths were attributable to heat.
R	About 40% of attributable deaths did not occur during heat-wave periods.
R	The causes of death that were increased included cardiovascular and respiratory diseases , mental and nervous system disorders , infectious and digestive system diseases , diabetes , and some external causes such as suicide.
R	In infants , the effect of heat was observed on the same day and was detected only for conditions originating in the perinatal period ( relative risk = 1.53 [95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.02] ).
R	Within the perinatal causes , cardiovascular , respiratory , digestive system , and hemorrhagic and hematologic disorders were the causes of death with stronger effects.
C	Heat contributes to an increase in mortality from several causes.
C	In infants , the first week of life is the most critical window of vulnerability.
B	Stress is a known risk factor in addiction relapse , and prior studies show that relapse induced by stress may be more likely than drug-cue induced relapse.
B	The main goal of our research was to establish the influence of perceived stress in methadone withdrawal outcome and the psychological factors involved.
M	A sample of 81 methadone maintenance treatment outpatients was evaluated and then observed during methadone dose reduction.
R	a multivariate analysis first showed that successful detoxification was predicted by perceived stress , patient-clinic staff agreement , pharmacotherapy support and social care ; and second , perceived stress was predicted by anxiety , depression , self-control , social care and benzodiazepine use.
C	These findings suggest that high levels of stress could increase the risk of failure in methadone detoxification , so a clinical intervention on the psychological factors related to stress would be indicated to improve effectiveness of methadone withdrawal treatment.
P	With increased numbers of business to business ( B to B ) firms hiring professional sales students , it is important that both sales educators and sales managers understand entertainment's influence and its potential consequences in the professional sales environment.
P	This study examines the perceived role entertainment plays in today's sales process and the importance of integrating entertainment topics into sales education and sales training.
P	The purpose of this study is to update the sales entertainment literature , record its current importance in the age of sales systemization , and propose entertainment strategies and guidelines that can be shared in both corporate sales training programs and university professional sales curricula.Methodology/approach: Partial least squares ( PLS ) methodology ( SmartPLS 2.0 ) was used to examine the model and assess the relationships between the constructs and their indicators.
P	Data was first gathered via online and in person surveys distributed to a total of 59 sales executives.
P	To determine whether there were significant differences between path coefficients , PLS multi-group analysis was used ( PLS-MGA ) to compare sales practitioners' response to sale educators and sales students.
P	This method was used because conducting pair-wise group comparisons can result in family-wise error.
R	Results indicate significant positive relationships exist between entertainment orientation , internal bonding activities , and sales performance.
R	The results confirm the path coefficients for the 3 groups , sales practitioners , sales educators , and sales students , did not differ significantly.
R	Therefore , all groups rated external entertainment as being important to achieve sales performance and internally for bonding with co-workers.
R	Originality/value/contribution: The responses of B to B sales professionals , sales educators , and sales students are compared regarding their perception of entertainment in developing and managing sales relationships.
R	Based upon the findings , sales professionals are provided with insight about the perceived role entertainment playsin today's selling environment and offered recommendations for collegiate classrooms and corporate on-boarding sessions that improve the knowledge of and ability to successfully manage entertainment of internal and external customers.
B	Previous studies regarding depressive symptoms and acculturative stress among immigrants have been limited to the initial period after immigration.
P	The relationships between depressive symptoms , acculturation , and acculturative stress among immigrants from the former Soviet Union were examined in this descriptive study.
M	Eighty immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had immigrated within the past 20 years were recruited in various community locations.
R	Participants ( N = 80 ) , including recent and longer residing immigrants , reported elevated depressive symptoms and acculturative stress.
R	Acculturative stress predicted depressive symptoms , controlling for dominant culture ( American ) immersion.
R	However , length of time in the United States was not associated with depressive symptoms , ethnic culture immersion , or acculturative stress.
C	Our results suggest that elevated depressive symptoms are related to acculturative stress but are not confined to the initial adjustment period.
C	Steps to decrease acculturative stress might help decrease depressive symptoms in immigrants regardless of the number of years lived in the United States.
B	Little is known about patients' views on taking selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and their decision-making processes regarding either continuation or discontinuation within a few months of initiating therapy.
P	To explore the experiences and beliefs of SSRI users in relation to initiation and execution of treatment , with the intention to identify patterns leading to discontinuation or continuation of treatment.
M	Semistructured qualitative interview study.
M	Eighteen patients , older than 18 years , were interviewed 3 months after starting SSRI treatment prescribed by a general practitioner ( GP ) , 9 of whom had discontinued ( discontinuers ) and 9 of whom continued treatment ( continuers ).
R	Two main patterns lead to either discontinuation or continuation of use.
R	Continuers were satisfied with the GP's role during initiation and execution of SSRI treatment and fully trusted their decision.
R	Continuers' attitudes toward treatment were predominantly positive ; they seemed to have little doubt about the necessity of using an SSRI and hardly considered discontinuing for fear of relapse.
R	Discontinuers , on the other hand , seemed to be less involved in decision making and often appeared to have little confidence in their GPs.
R	Most discontinuers felt that they lacked knowledge , and their attitude toward taking SSRIs was rather negative.
R	Discontinuers often were unconvinced about the necessity of using an SSRI and appeared to have a strong desire to discontinue treatment.
C	Lack of shared decision making between patient and GP , limited counseling during treatment , lack of knowledge , and patients' negative attitudes toward SSRI use and the disease itself , hampered the acceptance of the SSRI and brought on the decisional conflict to discontinue treatment.
C	Health care professionals could be more supportive during the initial months of SSRI treatment by eliciting patients' considerations for continuing or discontinuing treatment.

P	To assess reliability of information about nutritional facts stated on labels of industrialized foods.
M	A total of 153 industrialized foods , usually consumed by children and adolescents and marketed in the city of Sao Paulo , Southeastern Brazil , between 2001 and 2005 , were analyzed.
M	Nutrient contents stated on labels were compared to the results obtained from official ( physical-chemical ) analytical methods , considering the 20% variability tolerated by the current legislation to approve or reject samples.
M	Means , standard deviations , 95% confidence intervals for the nutrients analyzed , and the distribution of percentage frequency of samples rejected were calculated.
R	All salty products analyzed showed non-compliance of dietary fiber , sodium and saturated fat content.
R	Sweet products showed variation between zero and 36% of rejection due to their dietary fiber content.
R	More than half ( 52% ) of cookies were rejected due to their saturated fat content.
R	Nutrients associated with obesity and its health problems were those showing the highest proportions of non-compliance.
R	Lack of reliability of label information in the samples analyzed violates the regulations of the Resolution of the Collegiate Board of Directors RDC 360/03 and the rights guaranteed by the Nutritional and Food Safety Law and Consumer Protection Code.
C	High indices of non-compliance of nutritional data were found on labels of foods aimed at children and adolescents , indicating the urgent need for surveillance practices and other nutritional labeling measures.
B	Personalized medicine is a model in which a patient's unique clinical , genetic , and environmental characteristics are the basis for treatment and prevention.Aim , method , and results: This review aims to describe the current tools , phenomenological features , clinical risk factors , and biomarkers used to provide personalized medicine.
B	Furthermore , this study describes the target areas in which they can be applied including diagnostics , treatment selection and response , assessment of risk of side-effects , and prevention.
C	Personalized medicine in psychiatry is challenged by the current taxonomy , where the diagnostic categories are broad and great biological heterogeneity exists within each category.
C	There is , thus , a gap between the current advanced research prospects and clinical practice , and the current taxonomy is , thus , a poor basis for biological research.
C	The discussion proposes possible solutions to narrow this gap and to move psychiatric research forward towards personalized medicine.
P	To examine current practices of occupational health professionals in assessing significant others' cognitions and behavioral responses that may influence work outcomes of workers with a chronic disease.
M	A survey study among occupational health professionals , focusing on the assessment of illness perceptions , work-related beliefs and expectations , and behavioral responses of significant others of workers with a chronic disease.
M	We performed linear regression analyses to investigate which factors are related to occupational health professionals' assessment practices.
M	We used thematic analysis to analyze qualitative data on occupational health professionals' reasons to assess or overlook significant others' cognitions and behavioral responses.
R	Our study sample included 192 occupational health professionals.
R	Most seldom asked about significant others' cognitions and behavioral responses.
R	Organizational norms and occupational health professionals' self-efficacy were related to reported assessment practices.
R	Reasons to assess significant others' cognitions and behavioral responses included recognizing their influence on work participation , and occurrence of stagnation.
R	However , occupational health professionals indicated some doubt whether such assessment would always contribute to better care.
C	It is not common practice for occupational health professionals to assess significant others' cognitions and behavioral responses , although they recognize the influence of these factors on work outcomes.
C	More research is needed as to how occupational health professionals can best address the role of significant others , and apply these new insights in their daily practice.
P	This study investigated variables that may contribute to motorcycle conspicuity within a high-fidelity simulated environment.
P	The variables included motorcycle lighting , vehicular daytime running lights ( DRLs ) , and age of the driver of the other vehicle.
B	Research suggests that decreased levels of conspicuity associated with riding a small two-wheeled vehicle reduce the ability of other drivers to detect and respond to that vehicle effectively.
B	This lack of conspicuity is often responsible for the frequent injuries and fatalities incurred by motorcycle riders.
M	The 75 participants who took part in this study watched a series of video clips of roadway traffic and were asked to indicate when they saw a hazardous situation , such as the presence of pedestrians , motorcycles , or traffic cones.
M	Both motorcycle and following-vehicle lights were manipulated , and participant reaction times were collected and analyzed.
R	Analyses indicated main effects for all three variables as well as interaction effects between motorcycle lighting and vehicle-following conditions.
R	Overall , findings showed a link between DRLs and the effective detection of motorcycles and suggested that age-related changes affect the ability to detect and respond to a motorcycle effectively.
C	Although our laboratory findings corroborated previous correlational studies , further research in real-world settings , such as those with high-density traffic or under adverse environmental conditions , needs to be conducted.
C	Potential applications of this research include the assessment of appropriate lighting technology to enhance conspicuity of motorcycles and reduce the high rate of fatalities and injuries related to motorcycle crashes.
P	School-located vaccination programs may need to bill health insurance to be sustainable.
P	This mixed methods study assessed parent attitudes about school-located vaccination and billing.
M	Seven public schools in Denver , Colorado , participated in a school-located adolescent vaccination program that billed students' insurance.
M	From April through June 2010 , a survey was administered to parents of 1 ,000 randomly selected sixth to eighth grade students in these schools.
M	In March and April 2011 , focus groups were conducted with a sample of parents of adolescents attending these schools to further explore and help explain patterns emergent in the survey data.
R	Survey response rate was 66%.
R	Among survey respondents , 56% strongly supported and 29% somewhat supported school-located vaccination.
R	Forty-two percent reported concern about receiving a bill if their child participated in a school-located vaccination program that billed insurance , and 23% did not want to provide insurance information to the school.
R	Four focus groups were conducted with English speaking ( n = 17 ) and Spanish-speaking ( n = 14 ) parents.
R	Focus group participants indicated strong support for school-located vaccination , emphasizing the convenience of the program for both parents and adolescents.
R	These parents also appreciated the affordability of the program and reported feeling comfortable within-school vaccination delivery.
R	Very few participants indicated concerns about providing health insurance information to the school , but some expressed concern about potential record scatter.
C	Although some parents expressed concerns about billing health insurance for school-located vaccination , most parents indicated strong support for school-located vaccination.

B	Neuropsychiatric symptoms ( NPS ) occur in people with dementia throughout disease course and across etiologies.
B	NPS are associated with significant morbidities and hastened disease processes.
B	Nevertheless , people with dementia are not systematically assessed for NPS in clinical settings.
B	We review existing NPS measures for clinical and/or research purposes , and identify measurement gaps.
M	We conducted a computerized search of peer-reviewed published studies of measures ( January 1 , 1980-December 1 , 2013 ) using multiple search terms.
M	Measures selected for review were in English , had adequate psychometric properties , and were developed for or used with people with dementia.
M	Papers describing measures were evaluated by three coders along seven characteristics: behavioral domains , number of items , method of administration , response categories , targeted population , setting , and psychometric properties.
R	Overall , 2 ,233 papers were identified through search terms , and 36 papers from manual searches of references.
R	From 2 ,269 papers , 85 measures were identified of which 45 ( 52.9% ) had adequate psychometric properties and were developed or used with dementia populations.
R	Of these , 16 ( 35.6% ) were general measures that included a wide range of behaviors ; 29 ( 64.4% ) targeted specific behaviors ( e. g. agitation ).
R	Measures differed widely as to behaviors assessed and measurement properties.
C	A robust set of diverse measures exists for assessing NPS in different settings.
C	No measures identify risk factors for behaviors or enable an evaluation of the context in which behaviors occur.
C	To improve clinical efforts , research is needed to evaluate concordance of behavioral ratings between formal and informal caregivers , and to develop and test measures that can identify known risks for behaviors and the circumstances under which behaviors occur.
P	To assess whether multi-year engagement by primary care practices in a pay-for-value program was associated with improved care for high-need patients.
M	Longitudinal cohort study of 17 ,443 patients with 2 or more conditions who were assigned to primary care providers ( PCPs ) within 1582 practices that did and did not continuously participate in Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan's pay-for-value program ( the Physician Group Incentive Program [PGIP] ) between 2010 and 2013.
M	We used generalized linear mixed models , with patient-level random effects , to assess the relationship between whether practices continuously participated in PGIP and those practices' cost , use , and quality outcomes ( derived from claims data ) over a 4-year period.
M	For most outcomes , models estimated the odds of any cost and utilization , as well as the amount of cost and utilization contingent on having any.
R	High-need patients whose PCPs continuously participated in PGIP had lower odds of 30-and 90-day readmissions ( odds ratio [OR] , 0.65 and 0.63 , respectively ; P < .01 for both ) over time compared with patients with PCPs who did not continuously participate.
R	They also appeared to have lower odds of any emergency department visits ( OR , 0.88 ; P < .01 ) and receive higher overall quality ( 1.6% higher ; P<.01 ) , as well as medication management-specific quality ( 3.0% higher ; P < .01 ).
R	We observed no differences in overall medical-surgical cost.
C	Continuous PCP participation in a pay-forvalue program was associated with lower use and improved quality over time , but not lower costs , for high-need patients.
C	National policy efforts to engage PCPs in pay-for-value reimbursement is therefore likely to achieve some intended outcomes but may not be sufficient to deliver care that is of substantially higher value.
B	The main purpose of this study was to determine which correlate , perceived motor competence or motor skill competence , best predicts girls' physical activity behavior.
M	A sample of 352 girls ( mean age=8.7 , SD=0.3 yr ) participated in this study.
M	To assess motor skill competence and perceived motor competence , each child completed the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 and Physical Ability sub-scale of Marsh's Self-Description Questionnaire.
M	Children's physical activity was assessed by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children.
M	Multiple linear regression model was used to determine whether perceived motor competence or motor skill competence best predicts moderate-to- vigorous self-report physical activity.
R	Multiple regression analysis indicated that motor skill competence and perceived motor competence predicted 21% variance in physical activity ( R-2=0.21 , F=48.9 , P=0.001 ) , and motor skill competence ( R-2=0.15 , beta=0.33 , P= 0.001 ) resulted in more variance than perceived motor competence ( R2=0.06 , beta=0.25 , P=0.001 ) in physical activity.
C	Results revealed motor skill competence had more influence in comparison with perceived motor competence on physical activity level.
C	We suggest interventional programs based on motor skill competence and perceived motor competence should be administered or implemented to promote physical activity in young girls.
B	While it is commonly accepted that nursing care is generally of a good standard , it would be naive to think that this is always the case.
B	Over recent years , concern about aspects of the quality of some nursing care has grown.
B	In tandem with this , there is recognition that nurses do not always report poor practice.
B	As future registrants , student nurses have a role to play in changing this culture.
B	We know , however , relatively little about the factors that influence student decisions on whether or not to report.
B	In the absence of a more nuanced understanding of this issue , we run the risk of assuming students will speak out simply because we say they should.
P	To explore influences on student decisions about whether or not to report poor clinical practice , which is a result of deliberate action and which is witnessed while on placement.
M	Qualitative interviews were conducted with thirteen pre-registration nursing students from the UK.
M	Participants included both adult and mental health nurses with an age range from 20 to 47.
M	Data were analysed to identify key themes.
M	Category integrity and fit with data were confirmed by a team member following initial analysis.
R	Four themes.
R	The first of these , 'I had no choice' described the personal and ethical drivers which influenced students to report.
R	'Consequences for self and 'Living with ambiguity' provide an account of why some students struggle to report , while 'Being prepared' summarised arguments both for and against reporting concerns.
C	While there is a drive to promote openness in health care settings and an expectation that staff will raise concerns the reality is that the decision to do this can be very difficult.
C	This is the case for some student nurses.
C	Our results suggest ways in which educationalists might intervene to support students who witness poor practice to report.

B	The use of electronic learning formats ( e-learning ) in medical education is reported mainly from individual specialty perspectives.
B	In this study , we analyzed the implementation level of e-learning formats and the institutional support structures and strategies at an institutional level in a cluster of mid-European medical schools.
M	A 49-item online questionnaire was send to 48 medical schools in Austria , Germany and Switzerland using SurveyMonkey ( R ).
M	Data were collected between February and September of 2013 and analyzed using quantities , statistical and qualitative means.
R	The response rate was 71 %.
R	All schools had implemented e-learning , but mainly as an optional supplement to the curriculum.
R	E-learning involved a wide range of formats across all disciplines.
R	Online learning platforms were used by 97 % of the schools.
R	Full-time e-learning staff was employed by 50 % , and these had a positive and significant effect on the presence of e-learning in the corresponding medical schools.
R	In addition , 81 % offered training programs and qualifications for their teachers and 76 % awarded performance-oriented benefits , with 17 % giving these for e-learning tasks.
R	Realization of e-learning offers was rewarded by 33 % , with 27 % recognizing this as part of the teaching load.
R	97 % would use curriculum-compatible e-learning tools produced by other faculties.
C	While all participating medical schools used e-learning concepts , this survey revealed also a reasonable support by institutional infrastructure and the importance of staff for the implementation level of e-learning offerings.
C	However , data showed some potential for increasing tangible incentives to motivate teachers to engage in further use of e-learning.
C	Furthermore , the use of individual tools and the distribution of e-learning presentations in various disciplines were quite inhomogeneous.
C	The willingness of the medical schools to cooperate should be capitalized for the future , especially concerning the provision of e-learning tools and concepts.
B	Few studies have examined differences between rural and urban women in mammography barriers , knowledge , and experiences.
B	Exploring differences can help inform tailored interventions.
M	Women , aged 40 , who had not been screened in the past 2 years were recruited from eight federally qualified health centers across Louisiana.
M	They were given a structured interview assessing mammography knowledge , beliefs , barriers , experiences , and literacy.
R	Of the 1189 patients who participated , 65.0% were African American , 61.6% were rural , and 44.0% had low literacy.
R	Contrary to guidelines , most believed mammography should be done annually ( 74.3% ) before age 40 ( 70.5% ).
R	Compared to urban women , rural participants were more likely to believe mammography will find small breast lumps early ( 34.4% vs. 6.5% , p < 0.0001 ) and strongly disagree that mammography is embarrassing ( 14.6% vs. 8.4% , p = 0.0002 ) or that they are afraid of finding something wrong ( 21.2% vs. 12.3% , p = 0.007 ).
R	Rural women were more likely to report a physician recommendation for mammography ( 84.3% vs. 76.5% , p = 0.006 ) , but they were less likely to have received education ( 57.2% vs. 63.6% , p = 0.06 ) or to have ever had a mammogram ( 74.8% vs. 78.1% , p = 0.007 ).
R	In multivariate analyses controlling for race , literacy , and age , all rural/urban differences remained significant , except for receipt of a mammogram.
C	Most participants were unclear about when they should begin mammography.
C	Rural participants reported stronger positive beliefs , higher self-efficacy , fewer barriers , and having a physician recommendation for mammography but were less likely to receive education or screening.
B	The Australian government recognises the importance of informal care to enable ageing in place.
B	Yet , few multivariable studies have examined aspects of informal care that alter the probability of entry to residential care in Australia.
B	Existing Australian and international studies show differing effects of informal care on entry to residential care.
M	We utilise unique administrative data on aged care assessments collected from 2010 to 2013 , consisting of 280 ,000 persons aged 65 and over.
M	Logistic regression models were fitted to measure the propensity to be recommended care in a residential care setting , disaggregated by characteristics of informal care provision.
R	Providing some explanation for the divergent findings in the literature , we show that close familial carer relationships ( partner or child ) and coresidence are associated with recommendations to live in the community.
R	Weaker non-coresidential friend or neighbour carer relationships are associated with recommendations to live in residential care for women , as are non-coresidential other relatives ( not a child , partner or in-law ) for both males and females.
R	Non-coresident carers who are in-laws ( for females ) or parents have no impact on assessor recommendations.
R	Despite these significant differences , health conditions and assistance needs play a strong role in assessor recommendations about entry to residential care.
C	Co-resident care clearly plays an important protective role in residential care admission.
C	Government policy should consider the need for differential supports for co-resident carers as part of future aged care reform.
P	Few studies have examined self-control stability with samples of serious offenders.
P	This study examined incarcerated juvenile offenders to determine ( 1 ) if changes in self-control occur during confinement and ( 2 ) whether self-control changes affect functioning inside the facility and reoffending after release.
M	The analysis used data from a sample of male and female juvenile offenders in Florida who were released from a residential program in 2010-11.
M	Self-control and functioning inside the facility were measured with risk assessment data collected at the beginning and end of the residential confinement.
M	Reoffending was assessed for the 12 months after release.
R	Absolute and relative changes in self-control were common , and the absolute changes overwhelmingly involved improvement.
R	This led to improved functioning inside the facility and decreased odds of adjudication for a new offense.
R	Follow-up analyses revealed a key difference between males and females-for reoffending in particular , effects of self-control change were observed only among females.
C	Juvenile confinement in settings with evidence-based rehabilitation programming can produce self-control improvement.
C	These improvements , in turn , are associated with contemporaneous improvements in behavior during confinement.
C	These shifts also may lower recidivism after release , but this pattern appears less likely among males.
P	This study's aims were to evaluate patient knowledge of safe warfarin practices early in treatment , and to pilot a nursing telephone follow-up enhancement to a pharmacy-facilitated discharge.
M	Forty-two randomized patients in either "enhanced follow-up" or "treatment as usual" groups completed the study.
R	Enhanced treatment resulted in significant improvement in warfarin knowledge ( 86% versus 71% ).
R	In critical safety related knowledge questions even larger improvements were present ( similar to 96% compared to similar to 77% ).
C	The hypothesis that non-adherence generating rehospitalization is a function of poorer knowledge was not supported as there were no warfarin-related readmissions during the study.
C	The study supports the use of enhanced follow up and the need for larger studies to delineate what patient knowledge prevents rehospitalization and cost effective educational efforts.
B	Evidence-based guidance is needed to inform care provided to mothers and families who experience stillbirth.
B	This paper focuses upon how meaningful and culturally appropriate care can be provided to mothers and families from when they are informed that their baby will be stillborn to many years after the experience.
B	Avoidable suffering may be occurring in the clinical setting.
P	To promote and inform meaningful and culturally appropriate evidence-informed practice amongst maternity care providers caring for mothers and families who experience stillbirth.
M	A comprehensive systematic review was conducted which primarily synthesised relevant qualitative research studies.
M	An expert advisory group comprised of stillbirth researchers , clinicians , and parents who have experienced stillbirth provided guidance for the review and the development of implications for practice.
R	Grieving parents want staff to demonstrate sensitivity and empathy , validate their emotions , provide clear , information , and be aware that the timing of information may be distressing.
R	Parents want support and guidance when making decisions about seeing and holding their baby.
R	Sensitivity , respect , collaboration , and information are essential throughout the experience of stillbirth.
R	Culturally appropriate care is important and may require staff to accommodate different cultural practices.
C	The findings of the review and expert consensus inform the provision of meaningful and culturally appropriate care for mothers and families that have experienced stillbirth.
C	Evidence informed implications for practice are provided to guide the actions , communication , and behaviours of maternity care providers.

B	Paediatric rehabilitation involves the therapist delivering intervention-specific and non-specific behaviours.
B	Non-specific ( or general therapy ) characteristics are a key part of family-centred service ( FCS ) ; however , little research identifies observable behaviours to examine intervention fidelity to FCS principles and their impact on outcomes.
P	To generate a list of observable general therapy attributes essential to FCS interventions for children with physical disabilities.
M	Attributes of general therapy behaviours were derived based on a Delphi Process with multidisciplinary researchers.
M	A separate method identified attributes through the content analysis of semi-structured interviews with occupational therapists and physiotherapists.
M	A triangulation procedure identified general therapy behaviours for FCS.
R	Eight researchers participated in the Delphi Process.
R	Seventeen therapists participated in semi-structured interviews.
R	The Delphi Process generated 35 behavioural attributes divided into three categories: therapist behaviours ( 21 ) , client behaviours ( 9 ) and client-therapist behaviours ( 5 ).
R	Of the 19 attributes generated from the therapist interviews , 17 mapped onto those identified in the Delphi Process.
R	General therapy attributes addressed a range of behaviours including characteristics of the intervention procedure and the therapeutic process.
C	This work provides an improved understanding of how practitioners conceive essential and observable behaviours of FCS that will enable future researchers to identify their presence within an intervention session.
B	Insulin resistance is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) and in the progression to type 2 diabetes.
B	Recent reports concentrate on a possible relationship between incretin secretion and beta-cell function in PCOS.
B	The aim of the present study is to investigate the incretin effect in obese and lean women with PCOS.
M	Twenty women with PCOS and ten age-matched healthy women were recruited in the study.
M	The oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) and isoglycemic test were carried out on each participant after an overnight fast at 2-weeks interval.
M	Plasma levels of insulin , glucose , C-peptide , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) were assayed.
R	Obese women with PCOS demonstrated lower GIP concentrations ( area under the curve [AUC] ) in response to OGTT compared to the control group.
R	The incretin effect was found significantly augmented in the obese women with PCOS compared to controls.
R	This finding remained robust in the subgroup analysis including only body mass index ( BMI )-matched healthy women.
C	Increased insulinotropic effect could counteract the blunted GIP response to OGTT in obese women with PCOS.
C	It is suggested that the pathology of PCOS may also include impaired activity of the enteroinsular axis.
P	The purpose of the current study was to explore infrastructure issues that may be barriers to the establishment and improvement of dysphagia services in Malaysia compared to settings with established dysphagia management services ( i.e. Queensland , Australia ).
M	A mixed method design incorporating quantitative and qualitative data was used to increase credibility , validity and comprehensiveness of the results.
M	Thirty-eight hospitals ( Malaysia = 21 , Queensland = 17 ) participated in Phase 1 ( quantitative component ) of the study involving completion of an infrastructure checklist by a speech-language pathologist from each hospital regarding availability of networking and communication , staffing and financial support , facilities and documentation of guidelines for dysphagia management.
M	Subsequently , eight sub-samples from each cohort were then involved in Phase 2 ( qualitative component ) of the study involving a semi-structured interview on issues related to the impact of infrastructure availability or constraints on service provision.
R	The current study reveals that multiple challenges exist with regard to dysphagia services in Malaysian government hospitals compared to Queensland public hospitals.
C	Overall , it was identified that service improvement in Malaysia requires change at a systems and structures level , but also , more importantly , at the individual/personal level , particularly focusing on the culture , behaviour and attitudes among the staff regarding dysphagia services.
B	In the last decade , much research attention has been paid to notions of leadership and the professional identity of school.
B	It is widely agreed that school principals play a very important role in school improvement ; international reports point to 'school leadership' as a key factor in education quality , and recent studies suggest that the leadership identity of principals is critical for achieving effective leadership in schools worldwide.
P	The purpose of this study was to conduct a thematic exploration of the literature relating to school principals and leadership identity.
M	A scoping review was carried out.
M	Two major databases were searched for papers published on this topic in the last decade.
M	Once we had established an overview of research on this subject , we conducted a thematic analysis to identify the topical focus of research.
R	We found that the literature reflected an increasing and intensified interest in the topic of school leadership as the decade progressed.
R	Furthermore , a range of emerging subtopics was identified.
R	These included the relationship between school culture and professional identity in school principals ; the influence of ethical and personal factors on the professional development of principals ; the dilemmas of balancing education policies and personal experiences ; and the relationships between gender identity , racial identity , professional experience/career , training and leadership identity.
C	Several key issues emerged from the studies included in this review , such as the importance of external and internal influences in the construction of the professional identity of school principals.
C	Some of the research suggested that school leaders felt the need to develop a new professional identity.
C	Overall , the study indicates that school leadership and its relationship with school improvement should remain an important focus for educational research investigation.
B	Morbidity estimates between different GP registration networks show large , unexplained variations.
B	This research explores the potential of modeling differences between networks in distinguishing new ( incident ) cases from existing ( prevalent ) cases in obtaining more reliable estimates.
M	Data from five Dutch GP registration networks and data on four chronic diseases ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] , diabetes , heart failure , and osteoarthritis of the knee ) were used.
M	A joint model ( DisMod model ) was fitted using all information on morbidity ( incidence and prevalence ) and mortality in each network , including a factor for misclassification of prevalent cases as incident cases.
R	The observed estimates vary considerably between networks.
R	Using disease modeling including a misclassification term improved the consistency between prevalence and incidence rates , but did not systematically decrease the variation between networks.
R	Osteoarthritis of the knee showed large modeled misclassifications , especially in episode of care-based registries.
C	Registries that code episodes of care rather than disease generally provide lower estimates of the prevalence of chronic diseases requiring low levels of health care such as osteoarthritis.
C	For other diseases , modeling misclassification rates does not systematically decrease the variation between registration networks.
C	Using disease modeling provides insight in the reliability of estimates.
B	Despite common recognition of joint responsibility for global health by all countries particularly to ensure justice in global health , current discussions of countries' obligations for global health largely ignore obligations of developing countries.
B	This is especially the case with regards to obligations relating to health financing.
B	Bearing in mind that it is not possible to achieve justice in global health without achieving equity in health financing at both domestic and global levels , our aim is to show how fulfilling the obligation we propose will make it easy to achieve equity in health financing at both domestic and international levels.
C	Achieving equity in global health financing is a crucial step towards achieving justice in global health.
C	Our general view is that current discussions on global health equity largely ignore obligations of Low Income Country ( LIC ) governments and we recommend that these obligations should be mainstreamed in current discussions.
C	While we recognise that various obligations need to be fulfilled in order to ultimately achieve justice in global health , for lack of space we prioritise obligations for health financing.
C	Basing on the evidence that in most LICs health is not given priority in annual budget allocations , we propose that LIC governments should bear an obligation to allocate a certain minimum percent of their annual domestic budget resources to health , while they await external resources to supplement domestic ones.
C	We recommend and demonstrate a mechanism for coordinating this obligation so that if the resulting obligations are fulfilled by both LIC and HIC governments it will be easy to achieve equity in global health financing.
C	Although achieving justice in global health will depend on fulfilment of different categories of obligations , ensuring inter- and intra-country equity in health financing is pivotal.
C	This can be achieved by requiring all LIC governments to allocate a certain optimal per cent of their domestic budget resources to health while they await external resources to top up in order to cover the whole cost of the minimum health opportunities for LIC citizens.
B	Findings about the prospective long-term course of depression are usually derived from clinical populations while knowledge about the course in community and primary care samples is rarer.
B	As depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with considerable disability and costs , this information is needed to identify the percentages of subjects with a favorable or unfavorable prognosis.
B	Therefore our aim was to summarize the available evidence on the prospective longitudinal course of depression in both general practice and the community.
M	We conducted a systematic , computerized search of Medline and PsycINFO.
M	Main selection criteria were ( a ) adults with observer assessed depressive disorder recruited in the community or in general practice and ( b ) naturalistic study with follow-up length of at least three years.
M	As primary outcome the percentages of stable recovery , recovery during or at follow-up , recurrence and chronic course were used.
R	We identified 12 cohorts , with 4009 followed-up individuals.
R	Follow-up intervals ranged between three and 49 years.
R	Between 35% and 60% of participants experienced a stable recovery with no ( further ) recurrences , while 70-85% recovered at least once during follow-up.
R	A consistent percentage of 10-17% had a chronic course.
R	Recurrence rates varied considerably ranging between 7% and 65%.
R	Significant predictors of an unfavorable course appear to be mainly those variables that lie within the course of depression itself , i.e. history of depression , baseline severity , and comorbidity.
C	Use of broad inclusion criteria heightened study heterogeneity and hampered comparability.
C	Regarding stable recovery , the long-term course within general practice and community samples seems more favorable than within clinical samples.
C	Further research applying a standardized methodology is required.

B	Narrative therapy , an approach based on the reauthoring of life narratives , may be a useful psychotherapeutic strategy for youth who have experienced dating violence.
P	A cornerstone of narrative therapy is the concept of unique outcomes , which are moments that stand in contrast to a client's otherwise problem-saturated narratives.
P	The purpose of this study was to identify and categorize unique outcomes embedded in narratives about adolescent dating violence.
M	Text units representing unique outcomes were extracted from transcripts of interviews with 88 young adults who had experienced dating violence and were categorized using standard content analytic techniques.
R	Six categories of unique outcome stories were identified: facing-facts stories , standing-up-for-myself stories , cutting-it-off stories , cutting-'em-loose stories , getting-back-on-track stories , and changing-it-up stories.
C	This typology of unique outcomes can inform clinicians who work with clients who have a history of adolescent dating violence.
B	Individuals lacking effective coping skills to manage aversive affective states are more likely to behave impulsively despite harmful long-term consequences.
B	Urgency or the propensity to act rashly in response to negative affect is associated with a host of maladaptive behaviors.
B	However , relatively little research has evaluated the impact of affective variablessuch as emotion regulationon urgency.
B	Moreover , the role of urgency has not been examined in populations with mood and anxiety disorders , a group for whom maladaptive coping and avoidance behaviors are common responses to heightened affect.
B	This study evaluated the association between urgency and three variables associated with the amplification of affect ( anxiety sensitivity ( AS ) , access to emotion regulation strategies , and distress intolerance ).
M	Data were collected from an unselected community sample ( n = 297 ) and a clinical sample with a mood and/or anxiety disorder ( n = 99 ).
R	Results from a linear regression indicated significant associations between both distress intolerance and emotion regulation strategies and urgency.
R	AS was significantly associated with urgency when considered alone , but did not remain significant when considered in the context of an alternative measure of distress intolerance and emotion regulation.
C	These findings suggest that intolerance of distressing states and lack access to a repertoire of emotion regulation strategies are strongly associated with acting impulsively in response to negative affect.
C	Treatment implications and future research directions are discussed.

B	Hospital-based registries provide a key contribution in assessing the quality of care in acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) patients , although some concern on selection bias of included cases has recently arisen.
B	We investigated the feasibility of a retrospective , population-based registry of MIs in monitoring the quality of care.
M	We identified all the hospitalizations with a diagnosis of acute MI among 35-79 years old residents in the Varese province , Northern Italy , in 2007-2008.
M	Information needed to define performance according to the American Heart Association set was extracted from hospital case histories.
M	To characterize our approach , we focus on data completeness for critical event times and eligibility criteria , and on the analysis of ST-elevated MI ( STEMI ) patients according to received reperfusion treatment.
R	Exact time of hospital admission and of percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) procedure was available in 96% and 77% of MIs , with no difference between non-transferred ( n = 1399 ) and inter-hospital transferred ( n = 300 ) patients.
R	Data completeness for eligibility to action/treatment criteria was > 90% for each performance measure except statin prescription at discharge ( 76% ).
R	About 45% of STEMI experienced a delay in PCI-capable hospital arrival , and only one every three ST-elevated MI patients received primary PCI ; these were more likely to be younger male cases with less comorbidities than un-treated patients.
C	Complementary to clinical registries , the retrospective population-based is a feasible approach which allows monitoring the entire pattern of care of all hospitalized MI patients independent of their clinical characteristics.
P	To examine the combined influence of poverty and dangerousness of the neighborhood on active transportation ( AT ) to school among a cohort of children followed throughout the early school years.
M	Growth curve modeling was used to identify determinants of AT to school among 710 children participating in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development from 2003 through 2006.
M	Parent-reported dangerousness and pedestrian-vehicle collision data were merged with travel mode and health data.
R	At age 6 years , insufficient household income , having an older sibling , and living in a neighborhood that is not excellent for raising children , or characterized with high decay were predictive of greater likelihood of using AT and remained unchanged as children progressed from kindergarten through grade 2.
C	A public health concern is children experiencing environmental injustice.
C	Since AT is most likely to be adopted by those living in poverty and because it is also associated with unsafe environments , some children are experiencing environmental injustice in relation to AT.
C	Interventions may be implemented to reduce environmental injustice through improvements in road safety.

B	Preventive home visits ( PHVs ) are considered a promising intervention to improve health and independent functioning of the elderly whilst reducing health care costs.
B	This systematic review focuses on cost-effectiveness of PHVs , analyzing randomized controlled trials evaluating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in fall prevention interventions.
M	Based on an online search ( PubMed ) and bibliographic findings in the eligible articles , five studies providing relevant information were reviewed.
R	While three studies indicate cost-effectiveness , one delivered no statistically significant results , and one proved cost-effectiveness only for a subgroup of the study sample.
C	Cost-effectiveness of PHVs appears to depend on careful adaptation of particular measures , for certain settings in special environments for designated patients and disease patterns , on a case-by-case basis.
C	Starting points for further research are the components of the economic evaluation , the setting , personnel and measures of the intervention , as well as the careful selection and analysis of the study sample and its subgroups.
C	A uniform follow-up time , standardized cost measurement as well as the use of standardized denominators like quality adjusted life years ( based on the EQ-5D questionnaire ) could build a foundation for comparable results.
B	We investigated the adequacy of maintenance phase pharmacotherapy received by psychiatric in- and Outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder , including patients both with and without a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder ( BD ).
M	In the Jorvi Bipolar Study ( JoBS ) , a naturalistic prospective 18-month study representing psychiatric in- and outpatients with DSM-IV BD I and II in three Finnish cities , We Studied the adequacy of pharmacological treatment received by 154 patients during the first maintenance phase after index episode.
M	information on treatments prescribed during the follow-up was gathered in interviews and from psychiatric records.
R	Of the patients with a maintenance phase in follow-Lip , adequate maintenance treatment was received by 75.3% for some time , but by only 61.0% throughout the maintenance phase and for 69.3% of the time ( 783/1129 patient months ) indicated.
R	Uninterrupted adequate maintenance treatment received was most strongly independently associated with having a clinical diagnosis of BD: other associations included inpatient treatment , rapid cycling and not having a personality disorder.
C	Adequacy of dosage , duration or serum concentrations were not estimated.
C	Findings represent an upper limit for adequate treatment within the cohort.
C	Provision or continuity of maintenance treatment was found to be compromised in more than one-third of BD patients during their first follow-up maintenance phase.
C	As expected , clinical diagnosis of 131 ) has a decisive role in determining adequacy of maintenance treatments.
C	However , also rapid cycling may facilitate provision of adequate maintenance treatment , whereas Outpatients and those with comorbid personality disorders may be disadvantaged Subgroups.

P	The purpose of this study was to identify the development of morphosyntactic accuracy and grammatical complexity in Dutch school-age children with specific language impairment ( SLI ).
M	Morphosyntactic accuracy , the use of dummy auxiliaries , and complex syntax were assessed using a narrative task that was administered at three points in time ( T1 , T2 , T3 ) with 12-month intervals during a 2-year period.
M	Participants were 30 monolingual Dutch children with SLI , age 6 ; 5 ( years ; months ) at T1 ; 30 typically developing peers , age 6 ; 6 at T1 ; and 30 typically developing language-matched children , age 4 ; 7 at T1.
R	On the morphosyntactic accuracy measures , the group with SLI performed more poorly than both control groups.
R	Error rates in the group with SLI were much higher than expected on the basis of mean length of T-units and scores on standardized language tests.
R	Percentages of dummy auxiliaries remained high over time.
R	No group differences were found for grammatical complexity , except at T3 , when the group with SLI used fewer relative clauses than the typically developing peer group.
C	The narrative analysis demonstrates different developmental trajectories for morphosyntactic accuracy and grammatical complexity in children with SLI and typically developing peer and language-matched children.
C	In the group with SLI , grammatical skills continue to develop.
B	Nationwide surveys identify food service workers as heavy alcohol users.
P	This article analyzes dimensions and correlates of problem drinking among young adult food service workers.
M	A telephone survey of national restaurant chain employees yielded 1 ,294 completed surveys.
R	Hazardous alcohol consumption patterns were seen in 80% of men and 64% of women.
R	Multivariate analysis showed that different dimensions of problem drinking measured by the AUDIT were associated with workers' demographic characteristics , smoking behaviour , and job category.
R	Conclusions and
C	These findings offer evidence of extremely high rates of alcohol misuse among young adult restaurant workers.
B	Homeless persons in the United States have disproportionately high rates of illness , injury , and mortality and tend to believe that the quality of their end-of-life care will be poor.
B	No studies were found as to whether nurses or nursing students require moral courage to help homeless persons or members of any other demographic complete advance directives.
B	Research hypothesis: We hypothesized that baccalaureate nursing students require moral courage to help homeless persons complete advance directives.
B	Moral courage was defined as a trait of a person or an action that overcomes fears or other challenges to achieve something of great moral worth.
M	The hypothesis was investigated through a qualitative descriptive study.
M	Aside from the pre-selection of a single variable to study ( i.e. moral courage ) , our investigation was a naturalistic inquiry with narrative hues insofar as it attended to specific words and phrases in the data that were associated with that variable.
M	A total of 15 baccalaureate nursing students at a public university in the United States responded to questionnaires that sought to elicit fears and other challenges that they both expected to experience and actually experienced while helping homeless persons complete advance directives at a local , non-profit service agency.
M	The study was approved by the Internal Review Board of the authors' university , and each participant signed an informed consent form , which stated that the study involved no reasonably foreseeable risks and that participation was voluntary.
R	Before meeting with homeless persons , participants reported that they expected to experience two fears and a challenge: fear of behaving in ways that a homeless person would deem inappropriate , fear of discussing a homeless person's dying and death , and the challenge of adequately conveying the advance directive's meaning and accurately recording a homeless person's end-of-life wishes.
R	In contrast , after their meetings with homeless persons , relatively few participants reported having encountered those obstacles.
R	So , while participants required moral courage to assist homeless persons with advance directives , they required greater moral courage as they anticipated their meetings than during those meetings.
C	Our study breaks new ground at the intersection of nursing , moral courage , and advance directives.
C	It might also have important implications for how to improve the training that US nursing students receive before they provide this service.
C	Our results cannot be generalized , but portions of our approach are likely to be transferable to similar social contexts.
C	For example , because homeless persons are misunderstood and marginalized throughout the United States , our design for training nursing students to provide this service is also likely to be useful across the United States.
C	Internationally , however , it is not yet known whether our participants' fears and the challenge they faced are also experienced by those who assist homeless persons or members of other vulnerable populations in documenting healthcare wishes.
B	Prior research suggests that both social networks and parent drug use influence individual drug use among adolescents and that peers continue to influence drug use among adults.
B	This analysis aims to determine whether parent drug use during childhood is associated with having drug-using networks in adulthood after adjusting for individual adult drug use.
M	650 young adult drug users were recruited through targeted street outreach and respondent-driven sampling in New York City ( 2006-2009 ).
M	Baseline surveys ascertained demographics , network characteristics , drug use behaviors , and parental drug use during childhood.
M	Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate this association.
R	The median age was 33 years , 22% injected , 49% were Black , and during childhood 26% of mothers , 32% of fathers , and 13% of primary caregivers used drugs.
R	After adjustment , having >1 parent who used drugs was associated with having a greater proportion of drug using ( Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR] = 1.18 ; 95%CI: 1.01-1.38 ) and specifically crack-smoking networks ( APR = 1.71 ; 95%CI: 1.21-2.43 ) in adulthood.
R	Females' networks consisted of more drug users ( APR = 1.18 ; 95%CI: 1.01-1.38 ) , injectors ( APR = 1.44 ; 95%CI: 1.09-1.90 ) , crack smokers ( APR = 1.48 ; 95%CI: 1.18-1.87 ) and heroin users ( APR = 1.43 ; 95%CI: 1.13-1.81 ) ; blacks had a greater proportion of crack smoking ( APR = 1.41 ; 95%CI: 1.09-1.82 ) , but a smaller proportion of injecting ( APR = 0.64 ; 95%CI: 0.43-0.94 ) and heroin smoking ( APR = 0.60 ; 95%CI: 0.47-0.77 ) networks as adults.
C	These data suggest that parental drug use is independently associated with having drug-using networks in adulthood.
C	Interventions that target parents and caregivers and that promote drug cessation could impede risky network formation in both adolescents and adults.

P	To discuss the implications of variability in number and type of simulation scenario , number and type of learners who comprise a course , and their influence upon scope of practice , role confusion , and role ambiguity.
M	Relevant articles from MEDLINE , CINAHL , EMBASE , Google Scholar , the World Health Organization , the American Heart Association , and NRP were included in this integrative review of the literature.
M	Findings/
R	Purposeful synergy of optimal SBT course construct with teamwork and communication can resist discipline compartmentalization , role confusion , and role ambiguity.
R	Five key themes were identified and coined the " 5 Rights" of NRP SBT.
R	These " 5 Rights" can guide healthcare institutions with planning , implementation , and evaluation of NRP SBT courses.
C	NRP SBT can facilitate optimal team function and reduce errors when teams of learners and varied scenarios are woven into the course construct.
C	The simulated environment must be realistic and fully equipped to encourage knowledge transfer and attainment of the NRP's key behavioral outcomes.
C	Investigation of teamwork and communication training with NRP SBT , course construct , discipline compartmentalization , and behavioral and clinical outcomes is indicated.
C	Investigation of outcomes of SBT using a team-teaching model , combining basic and advanced practice NRP instructors , is indicated.
B	Work-related violence is one of the most serious threats to employee safety and health.
P	To ascertain the extent of self-reported violence or threats of violence at work in relation to the general health of public sector employees.
M	The study population comprised 9 ,611 female ( 83% ) and male public employees in Sweden.
M	A questionnaire based on items derived mainly from validated instruments was constructed to cover aspects such as health , lifestyle , and physical and psychosocial work conditions.
R	One in three employees reported work-related violence , with the highest proportions among psychiatric nurses ( 79% ) and psychiatric attendants ( 75% ).
R	Work-related violence more often affected those who were <45 years old , worked <40 hours/week , worked nights , or reported poor health.
R	Regardless of gender , age , hours of work , night work , and type of occupation , exposure to work-related violence was associated with less than good general health , and this relationship was strongest for psychiatric nurses ( OR = 3.19 ; 95% CI = 1.28-7.98 ) , medical doctors/dentists ( OR = 2.46 ; 95% CI = 1.35-4.49 ) , compulsory school teachers ( OR = 2.14 ; 95% CI = 1.33-3.45 ) , and other nurses ( OR = 1.87 ; 95% CI = 1.23-2.84 ).
C	Work-related violence was frequently reported by employees in the most common public sector occupations , and it was associated with poor health in both genders.
B	Drug-drug interactions with insulin secretagogues are associated with increased risk of serious hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.
B	We aimed to systematically screen for drugs that interact with the five most commonly used secretagogues-glipizide , glyburide , glimepiride , repaglinide , and nateglinide-to cause serious hypoglycemia.
M	We screened 400 drugs frequently coprescribed with the secretagogues as candidate interacting precipitants.
M	We first predicted the drug-drug interaction potential based on the pharmacokinetics of each secretagogue-precipitant pair.
M	We then performed pharmacoepidemiologic screening for each secretagogue of interest , and for metformin as a negative control , using an administrative claims database and the self-controlled case series design.
M	The overall rate ratios ( RRs ) and those for four predefined risk periods were estimated using Poisson regression.
M	The RRs were adjusted for multiple estimation using semi-Bayes method , and then adjusted for metformin results to distinguish native effects of the precipitant from a drug-drug interaction.
R	We predicted 34 pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the secretagogues , nine moderate and 25 weak.
R	There were 140 and 61 secretagogue-precipitant pairs associated with increased rates of serious hypoglycemia before and after the metformin adjustment , respectively.
R	The results from pharmacokinetic prediction correlated poorly with those from pharmacoepidemiologic screening.
C	The self-controlled case series design has the potential to be widely applicable to screening for drug-drug interactions that lead to adverse outcomes identifiable in healthcare databases.
C	Coupling pharmacokinetic prediction with pharmacoepidemiologic screening did not notably improve the ability to identify drug-drug interactions in this case.
P	This article describes the process of developing and implementing a supplemental early literacy curriculum designed for preschoolers demonstrating delays in literacy development.
M	Intervention research and implementation research have traditionally been viewed as sequential processes.
M	This article illustrates a process of intervention development that was paralleled by a focus on implementation in early childhood settings.
M	The exploration , preparation , implementation , sustainment framework is used to describe factors that need to be considered during a progression through these 4 phases of implementation.
M	A post hoc analysis provides insight into a rather nonlinear progression of intervention development and highlights considerations and activities that have facilitated implementation.
C	The guiding principles of the exploration , preparation , implementation , sustainment implementation science framework highlight the important considerations in developing effective and practical interventions.
C	Considering implementation and sustainment during the intervention development process and using data-based decision making has the potential to expand the availability of user-friendly evidence-based practices in communication sciences and disorders and encourage a bridging of the researcher-clinician gap.
B	Being highly self-efficacious is a key factor in successful chronic disease self-management.
B	It is unknown whether neuropsychological rehabilitation improves self-efficacy in managing the consequences of brain injury.
P	To investigate whether levels of general and brain injury specific self-efficacy and quality of life ( QoL ) increased after neuropsychological rehabilitation and whether cognitive performance was associated with self-efficacy.
M	We conducted a retrospective clinical cohort study of 62 patients with acquired brain injury and cognitive complaints with measurements before start and after completion of treatment.
M	QoL was measured with the visual analogue scale ( EQ VAS ) of the EuroQol ( EQ-5D ) ; self-efficacy with the TBI Self-efficacy Questionnaire ( SEsx ) and the General Self-efficacy Scale ( GSES ).
M	Cognitive performance was measured as a compound score of tests for memory , attention and information processing speed.
R	Self-efficacy for managing brain injury-specific symptoms and QoL increased significantly after neuropsychological rehabilitation.
R	Both general and brain injury-specific self-efficacy were positively associated with QoL after completion of the programme.
R	Cognitive performance was not associated with self-efficacy for managing brain injury-specific symptoms nor with general self-efficacy.
C	Self-efficacy and QoL improve after treatment.
C	Further research is needed to identify the specific ingredients responsible for improvement of self-efficacy in patients with cognitive complaints.
B	Although the benefits of preceptor training programs on the performance of nurse preceptors have been reported , research related to nurse preceptors' perceptions of and experiences with preceptor training courses is relatively limited.
P	To explore nurse preceptors' perceptions of preceptor training courses and obtain information on their experiences in working as preceptors.
M	A mixed method design was conducted.
M	Participants and settings: Nurse preceptors who currently work at one of eight hospitals in northern Taiwan were recruited to participate in this study.
M	A questionnaire survey and focus group interviews were conducted.
M	A training course perception scale was developed and generated based on the current nurse preceptor training programs offered in eight hospitals.
M	Focus group interviews were conducted to obtain additional information on nurse preceptors' experiences in working as preceptors.
M	The survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
M	Interview data were transcribed and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach.
R	The results from the surveys of 386 nurse preceptors revealed that most courses included in the current preceptor training programs did not fulfill the learning needs of nurse preceptors and were clinically impractical.
R	The most necessary and clinically useful course was the communication skills course , whereas the least useful course was the adult learning theory and principles course.
R	Three themes were identified as problems based on the three focus group interviews conducted with 36 nurse preceptors: inadequate training was received before nurses were appointed as nurse preceptors , the courses were more theoretical rather than practical , and the preceptors experienced stress from multiple sources.
C	The results revealed that the current preceptor training courses are impractical ; therefore , the content of preceptor training courses must be altered to fulfill nurse preceptors' training needs.
C	Furthermore , problems identified through the focus group interviews reinforce the survey results.

B	To explore the cultural challenges facing expatriate nurses working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ).
B	Women do not have an active role in the workplace in KSA.
B	Concepts of religion , culture , and language are considered to be crucial and often the lack of women's participation is attributed to these factors.
M	A descriptive qualitative approach was used with two methods of data collection: interviews and focus group.
M	The study was located in a hospital setting in Al-Riyadh at KSA.
M	There were 20 non-Muslim nurses of different nationalities who participated in this study.
R	Several themes emerging from the nurses' experience of caring for Muslims such as the inability to carry out nursing duties because of religious and cultural factors and language barriers.
R	Most of the nurses have provided similar examples and discussed the same issues , such as patient's families , fasting , and prayer having a negative impact on care from their perspective.
C	There is a lack of expatriate nurses' orientation concerning religion and culture.
C	The nurses acknowledged the importance of language when they start dealing directly with patients and associated this language barrier with their inability to provide proper care.
B	A better understanding of caregiver burden and its determinants is essential to support caregivers.
B	Many instruments have been developed to measure caregiver burden in various illness contexts , but few have been psychometrically tested for caregivers of heart failure patients.
P	The aim of this study was to test the validity ( factorial and concurrent validity ) and reliability ( internal consistency ) of the caregiver burden inventory ( CBI ) in a cohort of caregivers of heart failure patients.
M	This was a secondary analysis from a cross-sectional study on heart failure patients and their caregivers enrolled from various Italian outpatient centres.
M	The factorial validity of the CBI was tested with confirmatory factor analysis , and concurrent validity was tested correlating CBI scores with the short form-12 health survey scores.
M	The internal consistency reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha.
R	In total , 505 caregivers of heart failure patients ( 52.2% women , mean age 56.59 +/- 14.9 years ) were enrolled.
R	Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the original five-factor model: time-dependence , developmental , physical , social and emotional burden.
R	This model fits the data better than the single-factor model , and the dimensions showed high internal consistency reliability ( Cronbach's alpha 0.91 for time-dependence burden , 0.92 for developmental burden , 0.88 for physical burden , 0.89 for social burden and 0.93 for emotional burden ; 0.96 for the total score of burden ).
C	The CBI proved to be a good multidimensional instrument for evaluating the burden in caregivers of heart failure patients and can be used in clinical practice and research.
C	This tool can be considered to tailor interventions aimed at improving caregiver outcomes.
B	Fast ForWord is a suite of computer-based language intervention programs designed to improve children's reading and oral language skills.
B	The programs are based on the hypothesis that oral language difficulties often arise from a rapid auditory temporal processing deficit that compromises the development of phonological representations.
M	A systematic review was designed , undertaken and reported using items from the PRISMA statement.
M	A literature search was conducted using the terms 'Fast ForWord''Fast For Word''Fastforword' with no restriction on dates of publication.
M	Following screening of ( a ) titles and abstracts and ( b ) full papers , using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria , six papers were identified as meeting the criteria for inclusion ( randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) or matched group comparison studies with baseline equivalence published in refereed journals ).
M	Data extraction and analyses were carried out on reading and language outcome measures comparing the Fast ForWord intervention groups to both active and untreated control groups.
R	Meta-analyses indicated that there was no significant effect of Fast ForWord on any outcome measure in comparison to active or untreated control groups.
C	There is no evidence from the analysis carried out that Fast ForWord is effective as a treatment for children's oral language or reading difficulties.
P	In this initial article of the clinical forum on reading comprehension , we argue that reading comprehension is not a single ability that can be assessed by one or more general reading measures or taught by a small set of strategies or approaches.
M	We present evidence for a multidimensional view of reading comprehension that demonstrates how it varies as a function of reader ability , text , and task.
M	The implications of this view for instruction of reading comprehension are considered.
C	Reading comprehension is best conceptualized with a multidimensional model.
C	The multidimensionality of reading comprehension means that instruction will be more effective when tailored to student performance with specific texts and tasks.
P	This study identifies challenges to the first nurse training program for undergraduate nursing students at a nursing and midwifery school in Iran using a collaborative approach in order to improve the program.
M	Action research was used as a research strategy with qualitative content analysis and quantitative evaluation.
M	The participants were 148 individuals from nursing academic and clinical settings , including administrators , faculty members , students , and staff nurses.
M	We obtained approval from the research deputy and ethics committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran , Iran for this study.
R	Lack of coherence in the educational program and implementation of the program , inadequate communication between management inside and outside the organization , insufficient understanding of situations by students , and improper control of inhibitors and use of facilitators in teaching and in practice were among the major challenges in the first training process in the context of this study.
R	After classification of problems , the educational decision-making authorities of the school developed an operational program with stakeholder cooperation to plan initial reforms , implementation of reforms , reflection about the actions , and evaluation.
R	Comparison of student satisfaction with the collaborative learning process versus the traditional method showed that except for the atmosphere in the clinical learning environment ( p>.05 ) , the mean differences for all dimensions were statistically significant.
C	The results confirm the overall success of the revised partnership program , but stressed the need for further modification of some details for its implementation in future rounds.

B	The stigma of mental illness among medical students is a prevalent concern that has far reaching negative consequences.
B	Attempts to combat this stigma through educational initiatives have had mixed results.
B	This study examined the impact of a one-time contact-based educational intervention on the stigma of mental illness among medical students and compared this with a multimodal undergraduate psychiatry course at the University of Calgary , Canada that integrates contact-based educational strategies.
B	Attitudes towards mental illness were compared with those towards type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ).
M	A cluster-randomized trial design was used to evaluate the impact of contact-based educational interventions delivered at two points in time.
M	The impact was assessed by collecting data at 4 time points using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers ( OMS-HC ) to assess changes in stigma.
R	Baseline surveys were completed by 62% ( n= 111 ) of students before the start of the course and post-intervention ratings were available from 90 of these.
R	Stigma scores for both groups were significantly reduced upon course completion ( p < 0.0001 ) , but were not significantly changed following the one-time contact based educational intervention in the primary analysis.
R	Student confidence in working with people with a mental illness and interest in a psychiatric career was increased at the end of the course.
R	Stigma towards mental illness remained greater than for T2DM at all time points.
C	Psychiatric education can decrease the stigma of mental illness and increase student confidence.
C	However , one-time , contact-based educational interventions require further evaluation in this context.
C	The key components are postulated to be contact , knowledge and attention to process , where attending to the student's internal experience of working with people with mental illness is an integral factor in modulating perceptions of mental illness and a psychiatric career.
B	Very preterm ( VP ) children face a broad range of neurodevelopmental sequelae , including behavioral problems.
P	To investigate prevalence , pervasiveness and co-occurrence of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) in school-age children born very preterm.
M	Using questionnaire and diagnostic interview data , parent and teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and ASD of 57 VP-children ( mean age = 9.2 years ) were compared with 57 gender and age matched full-term children using t-tests.
M	Intra-class correlation coefficients quantified parent-teacher agreement.
M	Correlation analysis investigated co-occurrence of ADHD/ASD symptoms.
M	ADHD/ASD measures were aggregated using principal component analysis.
M	Regression analyses investigated the contribution of perinatal risk factors , sex and SES to ADHD/ASD symptoms.
R	VP-children showed higher levels of parent and teacher reported attention problems , social impairment and compromised communication skills.
R	Fair to strong agreement was found between parent and teacher reported ADHD and ASD symptoms , indicating pervasiveness of observed difficulties.
R	Co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD symptoms in VP-children was found.
R	Lower gestational age was associated with higher ADHD and ASD symptom levels , male sex with higher ADHD symptom levels and lower SES with higher ASD symptom levels.
C	School-age VP-children show higher levels of ADHD and ASD symptoms , and attention , socialization and communication difficulties in particular.
C	Routinely screening for these problems is recommended in follow-up care.
P	The nursing staff in our center are very committed to the patients but have not had the opportunity for systematic clinical education , since there is no formal education for paediatric hematology and oncology nursing in our country.
M	We joint a project , developed to explore and develop collaborative working between nurses and doctors in paediatric oncology under the auspices of The European Cancer Organization ( ECCO ) , The International Society of Paediatric Oncology ( SIOP ) and The European Oncology Nursing Society ( EONS ).
M	The Appreciative Inquiry ( AI ) approach to change management was chosen as it looks at what works in an organization and builds on that to make improvements.
R	Using AI we chose to develop a programme of education for nursing staff , as a project of local interest , to enhance their skills and knowledge of the specialty with the main aim of providing high quality care and ensuring best practice.
R	We found that collaboration profoundly influenced the working environment and resulted in staff being receptive to new challenges.
R	With improved knowledge , nurses are actually more involved in best practice which , in turn , motivates the doctors and improves professional relationships and the patient's treatment and care.
C	We have stressed the importance of collaborative working throughout and used this model of nurse/doctor collaboration to improve the quality of care in our center.
C	We are very hopeful that this model of collaboration and education will last longer than the project itself and be followed by future generations of doctors and nurses.

P	To explore whether gender differences in sexual risk and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) among homeless youth may be explained in part by gender differences in their social networks.
M	Our sample includes 258 youth ( 64% male ) recruited in San Francisco from street venues and transitional programs.
M	Participants completed an audio computer-administered self-interview survey regarding their housing status and risk behaviors and an interviewer-administered survey regarding their social networks , and were tested for STIs ( chlamydia and gonorrhea ).
M	We examined relationships between sexual risk and STI rates and social network characteristics by gender.
R	Condom use was lower in young women than in young men , whereas young women were more likely to have an injection drug user ( IDU ) sex partner and to be diagnosed with an STI.
R	Homeless young men were more likely to have stably housed contacts and same-sex friendships in their social networks than were young women.
R	Stably housed network contacts were associated with increased condom use and decreased STI prevalence in young men.
R	Same-sex friends were associated with increased condom use in young women.
R	No young woman with a family member in her network had an IDU sex partner.
R	Having a network member who had been recently incarcerated was associated with having an IDU sex partner for young women.
C	Homeless young women's networks may place them at greater risk for STIs than young men.
C	Increasing mainstream contacts and same-gender friendships may protect all homeless youth from STIs.
C	Interventions addressing homeless young women's social networks may decrease their gender-disparate STI risk.

B	We examined trends in hip fracture incidence in Denmark from 1980 to 2014 , trends in subsequent 1-year mortality , and the prognostic impact of sex , age , and comorbidity.
M	This nationwide cohort study prospectively collected data from population-based Danish registries.
M	We included 262 ,437 patients with incident hip fracture and assessed comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI ).
R	Despite slight increases in incidence rates ( IRs ) of hip fracture up to the mid-1990s , the annual IR decreased by 29% from 1980 to 2014 in women but remained stable in men.
R	Decrease affected all age groups.
R	IR decreased in patients without comorbidity but increased with increasing comorbidity ( 13% in patients with moderate and 510% in patients with very severe comorbidity ).
R	Adjusted mortality rate ratios ( MRRs ) following hip fracture in 2010-2014 compared with 19801984 were 0.68 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65 , 0.71 ) within 30 days and 0.63 ( 95% CI = 0.61 , 0.66 ) within 31-365 days.
R	The mortality decreased up to 40% irrespective of comorbidity.
R	Compared with patients with no comorbidity , those with very severe comorbidity had adjusted MRRs of 2.48 ( 95% CI = 2.39 , 2.56 ) and 2.81 ( 95% CI = 2.74 , 2.88 ) within 30 days and 31-365 days post-hip fracture , respectively.
C	Although the incidence rate of hip fracture increased substantially with increasing comorbidity , the following 1-year mortality decreased by 40% from 1980 through 2014 irrespective of sex , age , and comorbidity level , suggesting improvement in both treatment and rehabilitation of patients with hip fracture.
C	Comorbidity burden was , however , a strong prognostic factor for 1-year mortality after hip fracture.
B	Previous research has linked insecure attachment styles and borderline personality organization to substance use disorder ( SUD ).
B	However , it still remains unclear whether those impairments apply to different kinds of SUDs to the same extent.
B	Therefore , in this study we sought to investigate potential differences regarding attachment deficits and borderline personality organization in two different SUD inpatient groups and furthermore in comparison to healthy controls.
M	A total of 66 ( 24 female ) inpatients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , 57 ( 10 female ) inpatients diagnosed with polydrug use disorder ( PUD ) , and 114 ( 51 female ) healthy controls completed the Borderline Personality Inventory and the Attachment Style Questionnaire.
R	Compared to healthy controls , AUD and PUD inpatients showed significant deficits in all attachment parameters ( p < 0.01 ) as well as a significantly increased amount of borderline personality organization ( p < 0.01 ).
R	No differences between AUD and PUD inpatients were observed ( p > 0.05 ).
C	Our results indicate that the drug( s ) of choice cannot be regarded as an indicator for the extent of attachment deficits or personality pathology.
C	These initial findings are mainly limited by the rather small sample size as well as just a single point of measurement.
C	Future research might also consider further covariates such as comorbidity or psychotropic medication.

B	Access to abortion continues to decrease in the United States.
B	The aim of this study was to explore attitudes toward abortion among clinicians who provide reproductive health care.
M	Clinician members of several reproductive health professional organizations completed a self-administered survey that assessed their attitudes toward abortion.
R	A total of 278 clinicians who provided clinical reproductive health services within the United States were included.
R	Nearly all strongly agreed that abortion should be available in cases of rape ( 89.6% ) , incest ( 89.2% ) , life endangerment ( 93.2% ) , health endangerment ( 91.0% ) , and fetal anomaly ( 85.9% ).
R	Although most strongly disagreed that spousal notification ( 81.3% ) and spousal consent ( 86.6% ) should be required for married women , fewer strongly disagreed that parental notification ( 57.6% ) and parental consent ( 66.9% ) should be required for minors.
R	Respondents were generally supportive of private insurance coverage ( 70.1% strongly agreed ) and Medicaid coverage ( 65.0% strongly agreed ) for abortion services.
R	Support for legal abortion and public funding of abortion were significantly associated with being female ( both p <= .03 ) and having no personal religious affiliation ( both p <= .04 ).
R	Younger respondents and men were more supportive of third-party involvement and mandatory counseling ( all p <= .02 ).
R	Abortion providers were significantly more supportive of abortion access ( legality of abortion , public and private funding , no third-party involvement , and no mandated counseling ) than nonproviders ( all p < .001 ).
C	Although reproductive health care providers were generally supportive of legal abortion and funding for abortion , lower support among younger respondents may indicate future difficulties in maintaining a clinical workforce that is willing to provide abortion care.

B	Mixed methods research has emerged alongside qualitative and quantitative approaches as an important tool for health services researchers.
B	Despite growing interest , among health services researchers , in using mixed methods designs , little has been done to identify the procedural aspects of doing so.
P	To describe how mixed methods researchers mix the qualitative and quantitative aspects of their studies in health services research.
P	Data Source: We searched the PubMed for articles , using mixed methods in health services research , published between January 1 , 2006 and December 30 , 2010.
M	We identified and reviewed 30 published health services research articles on studies in which mixed methods had been used.
M	We selected 3 articles as illustrations to help health services researcher conceptualize the type of mixing procedures that they were using.
R	Three main "mixing" procedures have been applied within these studies: ( 1 ) the researchers analyzed the 2 types of data at the same time but separately and integrated the results during interpretation ; ( 2 ) the researchers connected the qualitative and quantitative portions in phases in such a way that 1 approach was built upon the findings of the other approach ; and ( 3 ) the researchers mixed the 2 data types by embedding the analysis of 1 data type within the other.
C	"Mixing" in mixed methods is more than just the combination of 2 independent components of the quantitative and qualitative data.
C	The use of mixing procedure in health services research involves the integration , connection , and embedding of these 2 data components.
B	Pretest probability ( PTP ) and an exercise treadmill test ( ETT ) are recommended for the initial evaluation of possible coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , but the applicability of these tests in Korean women has not been evaluated.
M	Korean women with PTP , ETT , and invasive coronary angiography results were enrolled.
M	Across all PTP levels , PTP and ETT statistics were evaluated and independent CAD predictors obtained.
R	Of the 335 patients ( mean age 58.0 +/- 10.2 years ) , 99 and 236 were in the low ( LPTP ) and intermediate PTP ( IPTP ) groups , respectively.
R	The observed prevalence of CAD was significantly lower than the PTP.
R	( 7.1% vs. 9.1 +/- 4.9% in LPTP , p < 0.001 ; 23.3% vs. 33.0 +/- 15.1% in IPTP , p < 0.001 ) The ETT's sensitivity and positive predictive values ( PPVs ) appeared lower than previously reported ( LPTP: 42.9% and 16.7% ; IPTP: 61.8% and 37.0% ) , whereas the negative predictive values ( NPVs ) were higher ( LPTP: 95.1% ; IPTP: 85.4% ).
R	After multivariate adjustments , positive ETT ( odds ratio 3.276 , 95% confidence interval 1.643-6.532 , p = 0.001 ) independently predicted the presence of CAD , but the PTP showed only marginal predictability ( odds ratio 1.019 , 95% confidence interval 0.998-1.041 , p = 0.069 ).
C	In Korean women , the observed prevalence of CAD was lower than the PTP , and PTP showed only marginal CAD predictability.
C	Although a positive ETT independently predicted CAD , the ETT showed lower sensitivity and PPVs than previously reported.
C	Despite the limited value of PTP and ETT , the high NPVs of ETT appear useful for saving patients from unnecessary further examinations.
B	Previous research has documented an underuse of long-term control medications among children with asthma , in nonadherence with national guidelines on asthma care.
P	To determine if factors related to access and quality of asthma care are associated with underuse of long-term control medication among children with asthma.
M	A parent-report cross-sectional survey conducted in 26 randomly selected New York City public elementary schools.
M	Five thousand two hundred fifty children , of whom 912 had asthma.
R	Twenty-nine percent of children with asthma reported using a long-term control medication.
R	Among children with persistent asthma , defined as having one or more sleep disturbances due to asthma per week , 59.0% reported using a long-term control medication.
R	After adjusting for demographic factors , children who had an asthma plan , had visited a doctor in the previous 6 months for nonurgent asthma care , or were enrolled in an asthma education program were more likely to use long-term control medication ( odds ratios: 6.00 , 4.11 , 2.88 , respectively ).
R	Children of Spanish-speaking parents , African American children , and children with no health insurance were the least likely to use long-term control medication ( odds ratios: 0.51 , 0.49 , 0.20 , respectively ).
R	Children who reported recommended components of asthma care were the most likely to use their medication with appropriate frequency.
C	Children who reported markers of high quality , personalized medical care , were more likely to use long-term control medication.
C	These findings illustrate that components of the medical care received , and not only the demographic characteristics of the patient , are key factors in understanding the underuse of long-term control medication in urban children with asthma.
B	With the availability of more healthcare courses and an increased intake of nursing students , education institutions are facing challenges to attract school leavers to enter nursing courses.
B	The comparison of career choice influences and perception of nursing among healthcare students can provide information for recruitment strategies.
B	An instrument to compare the influences of healthcare career choice is lacking.
B	The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument to compare the influences of healthcare career choice with perceptions of nursing as a career choice.
M	The study was conducted in two phases.
M	In phase one , two sets of scales with parallel items that measure the influences of healthcare career choice and perceptions of nursing as a career choice were developed through an earlier qualitative study , literature review , and expert validation.
M	Phase two involved testing the construct validity , concurrent validity and reliability with a convenience sample of 283 first year healthcare students who were recruited at two education institutions in Singapore.
R	An exploratory factor analysis revealed 35-parallel items in a six-factor solution ( personal interest , prior healthcare exposure , self-efficacy , perceived nature of work , job prospects , and social influences ) that explained 59 and 64% of the variance for healthcare career choice and nursing as a career choice respectively.
R	A high correlation ( r = 0.76 , p < 0.001 ) was obtained with an existing tool , confirming the concurrent validity.
R	The internal consistency was sufficient with Cronbach's alpha of 0.93 for healthcare career choice and 0.94 for nursing as a career choice.
R	The test-retest reliability was acceptable with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.63 for healthcare career choice and 0.60 for nursing as a career choice.
C	The instrument provides opportunities for understanding the differences between influences of healthcare career choice and perceptions of nursing as a career choice.
C	This comparative understanding of career choice influences can guide educator and policy-makers on nursing recruitment.
P	Parents combine many roles when caring for a child with complex needs , but few studies measure parental value and enjoyment of childcare related activities.
P	This study aimed to describe parental competence , enjoyment and value of childcare related activities , particularly healthcare related activities , when parenting a child with complex needs.
M	This was a pilot cross sectional study.
M	Ten mothers of children with complex needs rated their competence , value and enjoyment of 156 childcare related activities using the Occupational Questionnaire ( Smith , Kielhofner , & Hawkins Watts , 1986 ).
R	The mothers rated childcare related activities as important and rated themselves as competent to undertake them.
R	Mothers disliked performing healthcare related activities , but enjoyed emotional care activities.
C	This study extends the current knowledge regarding the role tension described by parents of children with complex needs.
C	The finding that parents dislike performing healthcare related activities despite self-reporting high levels of competence warrants further investigation.
C	Gaining a better understanding of the role tension described by parents of children with complex needs may enable pediatric nurses to better understand the impact of home based care provision on parents and assist them to find ways to support families so this care can continue to be provided.

B	Adolescents with intellectual disabilities often present with problems of balance and mobility.
B	Balance training is an important component of physical activity interventions , with growing evidence that it can be beneficial for people with intellectual disabilities.
P	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of balance training on postural balance , gait , and functional strength in adolescents with intellectual disabilities.
M	Thirty-two adolescents with intellectual disabilities aged 14-19 years were randomly assigned either to a balance training group ( n = 15 ) or a control group ( n = 16 ).
M	Subjects in the balance training group underwent balance training for 40 min per day , two times a week , for 8 weeks.
M	All subjects were assessed with posture sway and the one-leg stance test for postural balance ; the timed up-and-go test and 10-m walk test for gait ; and sit to stand test for functional strength.
R	Postural balance and functional strength showed significant improvements in the balance training group ( p < 0.05 ) as compared to baseline ; however , postural balance and muscle strength showed no significant improvements in the control group.
R	Further , postural balance and functional strength significantly improved in the balance training group compared with those in the control group.
C	Balance training for adolescents with intellectual disabilities might be beneficial for improving postural balance and functional strength.

B	Prison suicide rates are high , and suicide-related behaviors ( SRBs ) higher , but effects of contact with such behaviors in prison have not previously been examined.
P	To compare the mental state of young men witnessing a peer's suicide-related behavior in prison with that of men without such experience , and to test for factors associated with morbidity.
M	Forty-six male prisoners ( age 16-21 years ) reporting contact with another's suicide-related behavior in prison were interviewed 6 months after the incident , with validated questionnaires , as were 44 without such contact at least 6 months into their imprisonment.
R	Significantly higher levels of psychiatric morbidity and own suicide-related behaviors were found in the witness group , even after controlling for their higher levels of family mental illness and pre-exposure experience of in-prison bullying.
R	Some personal factors were associated with higher morbidity ; incident and institutional factors were not.
C	Findings of heightened vulnerabilities among young men exposed to suicide-related behaviors in prison suggest a need for longitudinal study to clarify temporal relationships and inform strategies to prevent or limit development of morbidity and further harm.
B	Affiliating with 12-step groups appears to reduce relapse risk.
B	By relying on between-person designs , extant research has been unable to examine daily mechanisms through which 12-step group affiliation contributes to recovery.
P	To examine the daily use and factor structure of the 12 steps and intrapersonal predictors and moderators of 12-step use.
P	To determine whether the 12 steps were used in response to daily craving and , if so , which steps and in what contexts.
M	Data comprised 1304 end-of-day diary data entries from 55 young adults collected in 2008 from members of a college recovery community , combined with person-level baseline measures.
M	Exploratory factor analysis examined the factor structure , and multi-level models examined both day-level and person-level predictors and moderators of step use , including meeting attendance , drug and alcohol dependence , social support , and coping strategies.
R	Analyses produced two factors: Everyday steps , comprising surrender and maintenance steps , and action steps.
R	Moderation analyses revealed that only action steps were significantly associated with craving , suggesting that craving can spur their use , but only among individuals pursuing certain general strategies for coping with stress: Separate median-split models produced significant associations between craving and action steps only among individuals high in avoidance , high in support-seeking , and/or low in problem-solving.
C	This is the first study to empirically discern a 2-factor structure underlying the 12 steps , and to show that the two sets of steps are used in different contexts.
C	The study also illustrates the value of person-centered approaches to recovery research and practice.
B	Victims of dating violence experience suicidal ideation at a higher rate than the general population.
B	However , very few studies have examined the relationship between dating violence and suicidal ideation within an empirically supported theory of suicide.
B	The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide posits that thwarted interpersonal needs ( i.e. , thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness ) are proximal antecedents to suicidal ideation.
B	The experience of dating violence may thwart such interpersonal needs , thus increasing risk for suicidal ideation.
P	We aimed to examine the relationships among dating violence , thwarted interpersonal needs , and suicidal ideation and test the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide.
M	We conducted two cross-sectional studies on college students in dating relationships to examine these research questions.
R	Study 1 indicated positive correlations among dating violence ( i.e. , physical and psychological ) , thwarted belongingness , and perceived burdensomeness.
R	Study 2 generally replicated the bivariate relationships of Study 1 and demonstrated that , at high levels of thwarted belongingness , perceived burdensomeness was correlated with suicidal ideation , while accounting for the effects of depressive symptoms and drug use.
C	These results highlight the importance of using theory-guided research to understand the relationship between dating violence and suicidal ideation.
B	Electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ENDS ) present an emerging issue for tobacco control and data on product use behaviors are limited.
M	Participants ( N = 38 enrolled ; N = 16 compliant ) completed three lab visits over 5 days and were asked to abstain from regular cigarettes for 72 hours in favor of ENDS ( Smoke 51 TRIO - 3 piece , First Generation with 11 mg/ml filters ).
M	Lab visits included measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide ( CO ) and salivary cotinine concentration , questionnaire measures of regular cigarette craving after the 72 hour abstinence , and subjective product effects.
M	Participants used a topography device to record puff volume , duration , flow rate , and inter-puff interval.
R	Analyses revealed significant differences across products in puff count , average volume , total volume and inter-puff interval , with ENDS broadly showing a more intensive smoking pattern.
R	Cigarette craving scores dropped significantly after smoking regular cigarettes , but not ENDS ( p = .001 ) , and subjective measures showed ENDS rated less favorably.
R	CO boost , after ENDS use , decreased significantly ( p < .001 ) , and saliva cotinine significantly dropped between visits 1 and 3 ( p < 0.001 ) after ENDS use relative to after cigarette smoking.
R	For compliant and non-compliant participants , there was an average 82.0% [V1 - 16.1 cpd ; V3 - 2.9 cpd] and average 73.9% [V1 - 20.3 cpd ; V3 - 5.3 cpd] reduction in regular cigarette use per day during the ENDS trial period , respectively.
C	The ENDS were smoked more intensively than own brand cigarettes , but delivered significantly less nicotineand were less satisfying.
C	These findings have implications for the viability of certain ENDS as alternatives to cigarettes.
B	The main objective was to identify variables that predict functional disability in chronic schizophrenia over time.
M	We examined 95 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia ( DSM-IV criteria ) in a long-stage unit and 53 healthy controls ( matched for age , gender , and years of education ).
M	Neuropsychological battery included tests for verbal memory , working memory , executive functioning , and processing speed.
M	Functional disability was assessed at 6-month follow-up with the Disability Assessment Schedule after the neuropsychological and clinical assessment.
M	The study was conducted from September 2005 to July 2008.
R	Patient performance was significantly lower than that of the healthy comparison subjects on all neurocognitive variables ( p < .001 ).
R	Most , but not all , neurocognitive measures were significantly correlated with the patients' functional disability shown 6 months after admission to the study , including self-care management , vocational outcome , family contact , and social functioning.
R	Results suggest that processing speed has a significant influence in these relationships.
C	Processing speed plays an outstanding role in the relationship between neurocognitive symptoms and self-care , vocational outcome , and social functioning.
C	Our data support the possibility of processing speed as the best longitudinal predictor of the level of autonomy in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

B	In the last decades several instruments measuring anxiety in adults with intellectual disabilities have been developed.
P	To give an overview of the characteristics and psychometric properties of self-report and informant-report instruments measuring anxiety in this group.
M	Systematic review of the literature.
R	Seventeen studies studying 14 different instruments were found.
R	Methodological quality as measured with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist was insufficient for four studies , sufficient for seven , and good for six.
R	For self-report , the Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with a learning disability appears most promising , with good internal consistency ( a = 0.96 ) , high test-retest reliability ( r = 0.95 ) , sensitivity ( 100% ) and specificity ( 100% ).
R	For informant-report , the general anxiety subscale of the Anxiety , Depression and Mood Scale may be promising , with good internal consistency ( a = 0.83 and a = 0.84 ) and excellent test-retest reliability ( ICC = 0.78 and ICC = 0.92 ) , but poor interrater reliability ( ICC = 0.39 ).
C	Two instruments appear promising.
C	However , these instruments have only been studied once or twice , whereas the methodological quality of these studies was varying.

P	As state and federal accountability systems have increased demands for evidence of student achievement , the use of data to inform practice has become more prevalent.
P	More research is needed to understand not only what organizational factors shape data-use efforts but also how these factors enable or constrain educators' use of data for instructional improvement.
P	This article addresses this gap by examining how two types of education systemsschool districts and charter management organizations ( CMOs )use data and allocate their organizational resources to this end.
M	Data were collected from six secondary schools in two districts and two CMOs during the 2010-2011 school year.
M	Over 70 interviews were conducted with teachers and school and system leaders.
M	Patterns from within and across school systems are presented.
R	Key contextual differences had a strong influence on data-use efforts: Accountability pressures shaped the patterns in data use , whereas other organizational conditionsstructure and decision-making rights , size and growth trajectory , financial resources , and degree of regulationrestricted or facilitated the systems' mobilization of resources for these efforts.
C	This study suggests that the school systems as a whole play a critical role in supporting schools and educators in using data , regardless of whether that system is district or charter.
C	As this article is one of the first to offer a comparative look at data use between school districts and CMOs , it lays the groundwork for diffusion of promising practices across these systems for school and system leaders.
B	Most of the nearly 104 million underweight children in the world lived in South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in 2010.
B	According to the 2014 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey ( EDHS ) report , 24 and 7% of children aged 6-59 months were underweight and severely underweight , respectively.
B	Although appropriate child feeding and nutritional interventions reduce child illness and death , malnutrition remains a leading public health problem in Ethiopia.
B	As literature on the issue is scarce in northwest Ethiopia , this study aimed at determining the prevalence of under-weight and associated factors in children 6-59 months of age in Takusa district , northwest Ethiopia.
M	A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February , 2017 , at Takusa district , northwest Ethiopia.
M	A total of 645 subjects were selected using the multi-stage sampling technique.
M	Anthro software version 2.02 was used to determine the nutritional status of the children.
M	A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with underweight.
M	Adjusted Odds Ratios ( AOR ) with the corresponding 95% Confidence Interval ( CI ) were used to show the strength of associations , and variables with P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
R	In this study , the overall prevalence of underweight was 19.5% ( 95% CI: 16.4-22.8 ).
R	According to the multivariate analysis , urban residence ( AOR = 0.60 ; 95% CI: 0.38-0.95 ) , no antenatal care ( ANC ) follow up ( AOR = 1.59 ; 95% CI 1.01-2.52 ) , and mothers age ( over 35 years ) ( AOR = 0.62 ; 95% CI: 0.38-0.99 ) were significantly associated with lower odds of underweight.
C	In the study community , the prevalence of underweight was lower than the findings of different studies in Ethiopia.
C	Advanced maternal age ( > 35 years ) , no antenatal follow up during pregnancy , and rural residence were significantly associated with underweight.
C	Therefore , interventions targeting community management of acute malnutrition might be appropriate to manage the problem of underweight ; efforts should also be intensified to reduce under-weight by focusing on identified determinants.
B	Psychosocial interventions for carers of people with dementia are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in dementia care.
B	We aim to systematically review the evidence from existing systematic reviews of psychosocial interventions for informal carers of people with dementia.
M	Thirty-one systematic reviews were identified ; following quality appraisal , data from 13 reviews , rated as high or moderate quality , were extracted.
R	Well-designed , clearly structured multi-component interventions can help maintain the psychological health of carers of people with dementia and delay institutionalization of the latter.
R	To be most effective , such interventions should include both an educational and a therapeutic component ; delivery through a support group format may further enhance their effectiveness.
C	Successful translation of evidence into practice in this area remains a challenge.
C	Future research should focus on determining the most cost-effective means of delivering effective multi-component interventions in real-world settings ; the cost-effective potential of technology-based interventions is considerable.
B	There is an increasing consensus globally that the education of health professionals is failing to keep pace with scientific , social , and economic changes transforming the healthcare environment.
B	This catalyzed a movement in reforming education of health professionals across Bangladesh , China , India , Thailand , and Vietnam who jointly volunteered to implement and conduct cooperative , comparative , and suitable health professional education assessments with respect to the nation's socio-economic and cultural status , as well as domestic health service system.
M	The 5C network undertook a multi-country health professional educational study to provide its countries with evidence for HRH policymaking.
M	Its scope was limited to the assessment of medical , nursing , and public health education at three levels within each country: national , institutional , and graduate level ( including about to graduate students and alumni ).
R	This paper describes the general issues related to health professional education and the protocols used in a five-country assessment of medical , nursing , and public health education.
R	A common protocol for the situation analysis survey was developed that included tools to undertake a national and institutional assessment , and graduate surveys among about-to-graduate and graduates for medical , nursing , and public health professions.
R	Data collection was conducted through a mixture of literature reviews and qualitative research.
C	The national assessment would serve as a resource for countries to plan HRH-related future actions.
B	The gender ratio at birth ( M/F: male births divided by total births ) is expected to approximate 0.515.
B	This has shown to be declining in industrialised countries and to display a latitude gradient in Europe , with more males born in southern climates.
M	Annual national data for Scandinavian countries for male and female live births were obtained from the World Health Organisation and analysed with contingency tables.
R	This study analysed 18 ,250 ,193 live births.
R	A significant decreasing trend in M/F was noted in all countries except Norway , and overall.
R	There was no latitude gradient.
R	M/F was less than 0.515 for almost all countries , with a resultant male deficit of 19 ,517 live births.
C	M/F is decreasing in Scandinavia and M/F overall is < 0.515.
C	The interaction of several poorly comprehended factors is likely.
B	The creation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Environmental Public Health Tracking Program spawned an invigorating and challenging approach toward implementing the nation's first population-based , environmental disease tracking surveillance system.
B	More than 10 years have passed since its creation and an abundance of peer-reviewed articles have been published spanning a broad variety of public health topics related primarily to the goal of reducing diseases of environmental origin.
P	To evaluate peer-reviewed literature related to Environmental Public Health Tracking during 2002-2012 , recognize major milestones and challenges , and offer recommendations.
M	A narrative overview was conducted using titles and abstracts of peer-reviewed articles , key word searches , and science-based search engine databases.
M	Main
R	Eighty published articles related to "health tracking" were identified and categorized according to 4 crossed-central themes.
R	The Science and Research theme accounted for the majority of published articles , followed by Policy and Practice , Collaborations Among Health and Environmental Programs , and Network Development.
C	Overall , progress was reported in the areas of data linkage , data sharing , surveillance methods , and network development.
C	Ongoing challenges included formulating better ways to establish the connections between health and the environment , such as using biomonitoring , public water systems , and private well water data.
C	Recommendations for future efforts include use of data to inform policy and practice and use of electronic health records data for environmental health surveillance.
P	We sought to examine relationships between women's sexual orientations and their sexual assault experiences before and during university.
M	Self-reported responses on a web-based survey of 5 ,439 female undergraduates who participated in the Campus Sexual Assault study were analyzed to compare three groups: bisexuals , lesbians , and heterosexuals.
M	Groups were compared in terms of the prevalence of sexual assault before and during university , and the extent to which sexual assault before university predicted sexual assault during university.
R	The prevalence of sexual assault before and during university was higher among bisexuals and lesbians compared with heterosexuals ( 25.4% of bisexuals , 22.4% of lesbians , and 10.7% of heterosexuals were sexually assaulted before university ; 24.0% of bisexuals , 17.9% of lesbians , and 13.3% of heterosexuals were sexually assaulted during university ).
R	Sexual assault before university was highly predictive of sexual assault during university , especially among non-heterosexuals.
R	Compared with heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university ( the referent group ) , previously assaulted non-heterosexuals ( bisexuals/lesbians ) had eight times the odds of sexual assault during university ( adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8.75 ) , whereas previously assaulted heterosexuals had four times the odds of sexual assault during university ( AOR , 4.40 ).
R	However , there was no difference in the odds of sexual assault during university between non-heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university and heterosexuals not sexually assaulted before university.
C	Bisexual and lesbian women are more likely than heterosexual women to be sexually assaulted before and during university.
C	Sexual assault before university is linked to sexual assault during university for all women , with this association being especially pronounced among non-heterosexuals.

B	This study is based on the ontological assumption about human interdependence , and also on earlier research , which has shown that patients in psychiatric hospitals and their relatives experience suffering and indignity.
P	The aim of this study is to explore the experience of patients and relatives regarding respect for dignity following admission to a psychiatric unit.
M	The methodological approach is a phenomenological hermeneutic method.
M	This study is based on qualitative interviews conducted with six patients at a psychiatric hospital and five relatives of patients who experienced psychosis.
M	Permission was given by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in Western Norway , the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and all wards within the hospital in which the patients were interviewed.
R	The analysis revealed one main theme: The significance of small things for experiencing dignity' and four subthemes described as follows - to be conscious of small things' , being conscious of what one says' , being met' and to be aware of personal chemistry'.
C	Staff members seem not to give enough attention to the importance of these small things.
C	Staff members need to explore this phenomenon systematically and expand their own understanding of it.
P	The aim of the review was to summarize the longitudinal changes in bowel dysfunction among patients with rectal cancer within the first five years following sphincter-preserving resection.
M	A series of literature searches were conducted on six English-language electronic databases.
M	Articles published after 1990 were searched.
M	A total of 29 articles ( reporting 27 studies ) was found.
R	Bowel dysfunction , including an alteration in the frequency of bowel movements , incontinence , abnormal sensations , and difficulties with evacuation , is reported among patients with rectal cancer within the first five years after sphincter-preserving resection.
R	These problems are most frequent and severe within the first year , especially within the first six months , and stabilize after one year.
R	Some of the problems may last for years.
C	Supportive care for bowel dysfunction is needed , and should include the provision of information and psychological support delivered in multiple steps.
C	Oncology nurses can play an important role in providing supportive care for rectal cancer patients with bowel dysfunction.

B	Although relationship satisfaction has a notable impact on treatment outcome , no economic , reliable , and valid measure is currently available in the German-speaking area.
P	To develop a short form of the Partnership Questionnaire ( PFB-K ).
M	The PFB-K was evaluated and standardized based on a current survey from 2011 ( N = 1 ,390 ).
R	There were good values of internal consistency for the total scores of the PFB-K ( total: alpha = .84 ; women: alpha = .87 ; men: alpha = .81 ).
R	The standardization was separately conducted for gender and age ( 19-39 , 40-59 and 60-89 years ).
C	The short form can be used in praxis and research.
C	In future research a cross validation in a clinical sample should be considered.
B	Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale ( PDS ) is a self-descriptive measure developed to provide information regarding posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) diagnosis and symptom severity.
P	The aim of this article is to report on the validation of the Polish version of PDS and to test its factor structure with reference to two models: an original three-factor model ( Reexperiencing , Avoidance , and Arousal ) and alternative five-factor model ( Reexperiencing , Avoidance , Numbing , Dysphoric Arousal , and Anxious Arousal ).
M	The validation procedure included three studies conducted on samples of separate populations: university-level students ( n = 507 ) , individuals who had experienced various traumas ( n = 320 ) , and treatment-seeking survivors of motor vehicle accidents ( MVA ) ( n = 302 ).
M	Various other measures of trauma-related psychopathology were administered to participants , as well as the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview ( SCID ) in the case of MVA patients.
R	PDS showed high internal consistency and test-retest reliability , good diagnostic agreement with SCID , good sensitivity but relatively low specificity.
R	The satisfactory convergent validity was supported by a large number of significant correlations with other measures of trauma-related psychopathology.
R	Confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) generally confirmed both the three-factor structure and the alternative five-factor structure of the questionnaire.
C	The results show generally good psychometric properties of the Polish version of PDS.
B	JC polyomavirus ( JCV ) is an epitheliotropic and neurotropic virus that identified in relationship with some devastating complications such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) and linked to colorectal cancer.
B	The aim of current study was to identify the prevalence of JCV in colorectal cancer for the first time in Iran.
M	This retrospective case-control study was conducted by the hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran from 2011 to 2016.
M	Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) blocks were used for DNA extraction by QIAamp ( R ) DNA FFPE Tissue Kit.
M	The SYBER Green Real-time PCR assay performed by specific primers for JCV T-Large Ag.
M	Melting curve analysis used for evaluation of amplification specificity.
M	Positive control cloned in pTZ57R/T plasmid by Generay Biotechnology system.
R	Of 157 specimens 66 were colorectal cancer by the mean age ( y ) +/- std.
R	deviation 59.35 +/- 14.48 and 91 healthy control by the mean age ( y ) +/- std.
R	deviation 57.21 +/- 14.66.
R	All 157 specimens tested for JCV T-Large Ag gene by Real-time PCR method and we found that there was not any positive result although the melting analysis showed specificity of positive control amplification.
C	Low prevalence of JCV infection in Iranian CRC population confirmed by the current study results ; there was not any JCV positive result in CRC and healthy control groups.
C	Further studies by broader and different populations are recommended.
P	The majority of births to young women are unintended ( either mistimed or unwanted ) , bearing an increased risk of poor health outcomes for both mother and child.
P	In this analysis , we describe trends of unwanted , mistimed , and intended births reported by all women and specifically by young women in the National Survey of Family Growth ( NSFG ).
M	Using data from the 1982 , 1988 , 1995 , and 2002 NSFG surveys , we calculated the proportion of unwanted , mistimed , and intended births by maternal age at birth.
M	For the 1995 and 2002 NSFG surveys , we also assessed birth intentions among 15-24-year-old nulliparous women and the mean number of unwanted births in the past 5 years among all 15-24-year-old women.
R	The proportion of unintended births decreased between 1988 and 1995 but increased between 1995 and 2002.
R	This recent increase was attributed to the increased proportion of unwanted births reported by women <25 years of age from 10.4% in 1995 to 18.6% in 2002 ( p < .01 ).
R	Between 1995 and 2002 , the proportion of 15-24-year-old nulliparous women who intended no future births incerased from 8.1% to 10.4% ( p < .05 ) , and the mean number of unwanted births per 1000 women aged 15-24 years increased from 25 to 48 ( p < .01 ).
C	Our analyses suggest an increasing trend in unwanted childbearing among young women between 1995 and 2002.
C	Further research is needed to understand the meaning and causes of increased unwanted childbearing among young women and to identify characteristics of those at risk.

B	Since subjects included in population studies tend to underreport their weight and overestimate their height , obesity prevalence based on these data is often inaccurate.
B	A reduced obesity threshold for self-reported height and weight was proposed and evaluated for its accuracy.
M	Self-reported heights and weights were compared with measured heights and weights in a Swiss city adult population representative sample.
M	Participants were asked their height and weight and were invited to undergo a health examination , during which these data were measured.
M	An optimal body mass index ( BMI ) value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis and its ability to correctly estimate obesity prevalence was tested on an external French population sample.
R	The Swiss population sample consisted of 13 162 subjects ( mean age 51.4 ).
R	The comparison between self-reported and measured data showed that obesity prevalence calculated from declarations was underestimated: among obese subjects ( according to measured BMI ) , 33.6% of men and 27.5% of women were considered to be non-obese according to their self-report.
R	Considering measures as a reference , a lower BMI cut-off of 29.2 kg/m( 2 ) was identified for both genders for the definition of obesity based on self-report.
R	Respective misclassification was reduced to 17.9% in men and 16.9% in women.
R	The validation procedure on a French population sample ( n = 1858 ) yielded similar results.
C	The reduced threshold based on self-report allowed a better estimation of obesity prevalence.
C	Its use should be limited to population studies only.
B	Ageism in long-term care is pervasive , but it is not easy to define , to identify and to fight it in practice.
B	These difficulties could be overcome if we develop research capable to conceptualize , detect , measure , and understand the multidimensionality and complexity of ageism.
B	Nevertheless , to achieve this , it is fundamental to know how ageism in long-term care has been previously studied.
M	This paper systematically reviews studies on ageism in long-term care services published before October 2015 and indexed in Web of Science , PubMed , and Social Care Online electronic databases.
M	Electronic searches were complemented with visual scanning of reference lists and hand searching of leading journals in the field of gerontology.
M	Four specific review questions were addressed: Which analytical angles ( aetiology , prevalence , manifestations , consequences , and interventions ) have been explored?
M	Which theories and concepts have been used?
M	Which methods have been employed?
M	Which variants of ageism have been covered?
R	Studies have focused mainly on the manifestations , etiology , and prevalence of ageism , neglecting its consequences and the interventions to tackle it ; a significant number of studies used scales of ageism which , despite being appropriate considering the aims of the research , present important limitations ; most studies have focused on residential services , neglecting non-residential services ; some of the variants of ageism have been well covered , while implicit and self-ageism have been under-explored.
C	Research on ageism in long-term care services is scarce but important.
C	Much has been done but much remains to be done.
C	An agenda for future research is presented.
P	We lack a clear understanding of the mechanisms of damage associated with suspected deep tissue injuries ( SDTI ) and sufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of various preventive interventions.
P	The purpose of this article is to evaluate noncontact low-frequency ultrasound ( NLFU ) as one component of a preventive program designed for preventing SDTI from progressing to higher-stage pressure ulcers.
M	In March 2009 , we added NLFU treatments daily for 5 days , then every other day until healed , to our prevention protocol in order to prevent progression of SDTI to a higher-stage pressure ulcer.
M	We report the course and outcomes of 6 SDTIs that were treated adjunctively with NLFU.
M	Treatment was limited to patients with an SDTI identified within 3 to 4 days of onset.
C	Following the addition of NLFU to the SDTI plan of care , these 6 cases of SDTI did not progress to advanced-stage pressure ulcers.
C	These initial findings suggest that the addition of NLFU to SDTI identified within 3 to 4 days of onset may be effective for preventing progression to higher-stage pressure ulcers.
P	The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of cardiorespiratory and pelvic kinematic responses to simulated horseback riding ( SHBR ) and to characterize responses to SHBR relative to walking in apparently healthy children.
M	Fifteen healthy children ( M-age=9.5 +/- 2.6 years ) completed SHBR on a commercially available simulator at low intensity ( 0.27Hz ) and high intensity ( 0.65Hz ) during 3 sessions on different occasions.
M	Heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure , and respiratory gases were measured at rest and during steady-state exercise at both intensities.
M	Pelvic displacement was measured during steady-state exercise.
M	Rate of energy expenditure , mean arterial pressure , and rate pressure product ( RPP ) were calculated.
M	Participants also walked on a treadmill for 26.8m/min to 80.5m/min in 13.4-m/min increments at 0% grade during 1 session to compare cardiorespiratory responses with those of SHBR.
R	Physiological variables across all 3 SHBR sessions were similar at both intensities ( p>.05 for all ).
R	Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) and coefficients of variation indicate good to modest reliability of cardiorespiratory measures during SHBR ( ICCs=.542-.996 for oxygen consumption , energy expenditure , and RPP ).
R	Cardiorespiratory variables , except for HR , were 2% to 19% greater , and pelvic displacement was up to 37% greater with high-intensity riding.
R	Treadmill walking at all speeds elicited greater physiological responses compared with SHBR ( p<.05 ).
C	Cardiorespiratory responses and pelvic kinematics are reproducible with SHBR in young children , and these responses were lower than those elicited by slow treadmill walking.
B	Hip fractures are common and serious injuries in the geriatric population.
B	Obtaining informed consent for surgery in geriatric patients can be difficult due to the high prevalence of comorbid cognitive impairment.
B	Given that virtually all patients with hip fractures eventually undergo surgery , and given that delays in surgery are associated with increased mortality , we argue that there are select instances in which it may be ethically permissible , and indeed clinically preferable , to initiate surgical treatment in cognitively impaired patients under the doctrine of presumed consent.
B	In this paper , we examine the boundaries of the license granted by presumed consent and use the example of geriatric hip fracture to build an ethical framework for understanding the doctrine of presumed consent.
C	The license to act under presumed consent requires three factors: patient incapacity , clinical urgency and clarity on the correct course of action.
C	All three can apply to geriatric hip fracture.
C	The typical patient frequently lacks capacity.
C	Delays in initiating surgical treatment are associated with markedly increased mortality rates.
C	Last , there appears to be consensus that surgery is the preferred treatment.
C	Nonetheless , because there is a window of safe delay during which treating physicians can stabilize the patient , address reversible causes of cognitive impairment and identify surrogate decision makers , presumed consent should be invoked only as a method of last resort.
C	A medical situation need not be characterized by risk of imminent and certain death for presumed consent to be relevant.
C	Rather , there are two distinct windows that must be considered: the time interval in which action may be delayed without danger , and the time interval needed to obtain a better form of consent.
C	Presumed consent is appropriate only when the latter exceeds the former.
B	Medication discrepancies occurring during transitions of care between hospitals and nursing homes increase the risk of adverse events for patients.
B	Resolving mismatched information between hospitals and nursing homes adds additional burden to nursing home staff.
P	The aim of this study was to characterize challenges facing nursing home staff in receiving and resolving medication discrepancies during resident intake.
M	This study used one focus group comprised of five nurses , one pharmacist and two administrators from four nursing homes to explore the staffs' experiences resolving medication discrepancies at resident intake.
M	Thematic analysis was used to determine primary themes and categories arising from focus group transcripts.
R	Three common challenges included 1 ) Nursing homes relying upon external providers for accurate information that is frequently delayed ; 2 ) Prescribing data shared between hospitals and nursing facilities on incompatible formats with inconsistent content ; 3 ) Following a specific communication workflow between facilities to resolve errors as efficiently as possible.
C	Improving access to formularies and medical histories for providers across the continuum of care and improving information sharing across transitions would improve communication , decrease discrepancies and increase patient safety during post-acute care transitions.
B	Recovery orientated intervention has experienced a paradigm shift towards stakeholder training and education within recovery colleges.
B	Such colleges are typically underpinned by a culture of emancipatory education that aims to facilitate recovery through educational choice.
P	The study aims to establish regional readiness for a recovery college.
P	Specifically , we aim to uncover key stakeholder attitudes towards recovery , outline a contextual conceptualization of recovery and show how inductive , community-based research can incorporate stakeholder views with core fidelity markers of a recovery college.
M	A mixed methods approach , specifically a cross-sectional survey , was adopted to intersect quantitative scales of stakeholder attitudes and qualitative assessment of recovery concepts and community needs.
R	Stakeholders' recovery attitudes were positive overall with some variation between participant groups.
R	Concepts of recovery were developing independent abilities , establishing connectedness to support and as a journey.
R	The needs cited by the stakeholders were largely correlated with the core fidelity markers of a recovery college.
C	A community psychology approach offers a means to ascertain regional readiness for a recovery college , and uncover key development foci based on community needs.
C	We recommend that service areas adopt a similar approach when considering recovery-orientated service developments.
B	Health systems are complex and health policies are political.
B	While grand policies are set by politicians , the detailed implementation strategies which influence the shape and impact of these policies are delegated to technical personnel.
B	This is an underappreciated opportunity for optimising health systems.
B	We propose that selective 'breeding' through successive evaluations of and selection among implementation strategies is a metaphor that health system thinkers can use to improve health care.
C	Similar to Darwinian evolution , the acceptance and accumulation of successful choices and the detection and discarding of unsuccessful ones would improve health systems in small and uncontroversial ways , over time.
C	The effects of better implementation choices would be synergistic and cumulative , accumulating large impact ( and lessons ) from small changes.
C	Just as with evolution of species , this means that even slight improvements over usual outcomes makes these numerous small choices as important a focus for system improvement as the overarching policy itself.
C	Several alternative implementation approaches can be compared under real-world conditions in prospective head-to-head experimental and non-experimental explorations to understand whether and to what extent a strategy works and what works for whom , how , and under what circumstances in different locations.
C	As in breeding or evolution , the best variants would spread to become the new , proven superior , implementation strategies for that policy in those settings.
C	Evolution does not produce a new species whole , in a single transaction.
C	Instead it gathers new parts and powers over time as different combinations are tested through competition with one another , to survive and spread or become extinct.
C	Without necessarily changing or challenging grand policies , extending this idea to health systems innovation can facilitate thinking around how local , small - but cumulative - improvements in implementation potentially contribute to a pattern of successive adaptation spreading within its viable niche and ultimately providing locally-derived , long-term improvements in health systems.
P	Stuttering varies between and within speaking situations.
P	In this study , the authors used statistical process control charts with 10 case studies to investigate variability of stuttering frequency.
M	Participants were 10 adults who stutter.
M	The authors counted the percentage of syllables stuttered ( % SS ) for segments of their speech during different speaking activities over a 12- hr day.
M	Results for each participant were plotted on control charts.
R	All participants showed marked variation around mean stuttering frequency.
R	However , there was no pattern of that variation consistent across the 10 participants.
R	According to control charts , the % SS scores of half the participants were indicative of unpredictable , out- of- control systems , and the % SS scores of the other half of the participants were not.
R	Self- rated stuttering severity and communication satisfaction correlated significantly and intuitively with the number of times participants exceeded their upper control chart limits.
C	Control charts are a useful method to study how % SS scores might be applied to the study of stuttering variability during research and clinical practice.
C	However , the method presents some practical problems , and the authors discuss how those problems can be solved.
C	Solving those problems would enable researchers and clinicians to better plan , conduct , and evaluate stuttering treatments.
P	The aim of this study was to explore reader gaze , performance , and preference during interpretation of cranial computed tomography ( cCT ) in stack mode at two different sizes.
B	Digital display of medical images allows for the manipulation of many imaging factors , like image size , by the radiologists , yet it is often not known what display parameters better suit human perception.
M	Twenty-one radiologists provided informed consent to be eye tracked while reading 20 cCT cases.
M	Half of these cases were presented at a size of 14 x 14 cm ( 512 x 512 pixels ) , half at 28 x 28 cm ( 1 ,024 x 1 ,024 pixels ).
M	Visual search , performance , and preference for the two image sizes were assessed.
R	When reading small images , significantly fewer , but longer , fixations were observed , and these fixations covered significantly more slices.
R	Time to first fixation of true positive findings was faster in small images , but dwell time on true findings was longer.
R	Readers made more false positive decisions in small images , but no overall difference in either jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic or reading time was found.
C	Overall performance is not affected by image size.
C	However , small-stack-mode cCT images may better support the use of motion perception and acquiring an overview , whereas large-stack-mode cCT images seem better suited for detailed analyses.
C	Subjective and eye-tracking data suggest that image size influences how images are searched and that different search strategies might be beneficial under different circumstances.
B	This study examined the relationship between new nurses' performance-based measurements and perceptions of clinical competence.
M	Descriptive correlational designs were used to examine the relationships.
M	Performance-based clinical competence was measured by the Performance Based Development System developed by Del Bueno ( 1990 ) , and perceived competence was measured by specific items on the Casey-Fink Graduate Nurse Experience Survey ( 1999 ).
R	Findings showed a significant difference in mean patient scores and professional role scores.
R	Nurses who met the criteria for problem management had significantly higher scores on the patient care scale and the professional role scale than those who did not meet the criteria.
R	Nurses with previous work experience ( 44% ) were more likely to meet the criteria for problem management.
R	Black participants scored lower on the patient care scale compared with others.
R	Conclusion:This study provides a beginning understanding of the relationship between new nurses' perceptions and performance-based clinical competence.
B	We detected the general level of knowledge about the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) and subsequent care in general practitioners ( GPs ) from Southern Italy.
B	We explored also the GP perception about their knowledge and training on diagnosis and management of AD.
M	On a sample of 131 GPs , we administered two questionnaires: the GP-Knowledge , evaluating GPs' expertise about AD epidemiology , differential diagnosis , and available treatments , and the GP-QUestionnaire on Awareness of Dementia ( GP-QUAD ) , assessing the GPs' attitudes , awareness , and practice regarding early diagnosis of dementia.
R	Specific screening tests or protocols to diagnose and manage dementia were not used by 53% of our GPs.
R	The training on the recognition of early AD signs and symptoms was considered inadequate by 55% of the participants.
R	Females were more likely to consider their training insufficient ( 58% ) compared to males ( 53% ).
R	Female GPs were less likely to prescribe antipsychotic drugs to control neuropsychiatric symptoms ( NPS ) and suggest specialist advice in late stage of cognitive impairment.
R	Multiple Correspondence Analysis ( MCA ) performed only on GP-QUAD suggested two dimensions explaining 26.1% ( "GP attitude" ) and 20.1% ( "GP knowledge" ) of the inertia for a total of 46.2% ,
C	In our survey on GP clinical practice , several problems in properly recognizing early AD symptoms and subsequently screening patients to be referred to secondary/tertiary care centers for diagnosis confirmation have emerged.
C	In the future , specific training programs and educational projects for GPs should be implemented also in Italy to improve detection rates and management of dementia in primary care.
B	Vitamin A supplementation is one of the best proven , safest and most cost-effective interventions in public health.
B	However , childhood vitamin A supplementation has not reached adequate levels of coverage in developing countries.
B	This study aimed to identify factors associated with childhood vitamin A supplementation in Ethiopia.
M	Cross-sectional study with stratified , two-stage cluster design.
M	Analysis of data from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey ( EDHS ) was used to identify factors associated with childhood vitamin A supplementation.
M	Data for 9276 children aged 6-59 months were included in the analysis.
M	Binary and multivariable logistic regression models were used.
R	Over half [54.5% , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 53.48-55.51%] of children aged 6-59 months had received vitamin A supplementation in the last six months.
R	Regional differences were found , ranging from 28.1% in Somali to 83.2% in Tigray ( P < 0.001 ).
R	Children in the poorest wealth index category [adjusted odds ratio ( AOR ) 0.60 , 95% CI 0.47-0.77] , children with mothers who did not attend any antenatal care ( ANC ) appointments ( AOR 0.56 , 95% CI 0.48-0.67 ) , infants aged 6-11 months ( AOR 0.52 , 95% CI 0.42-0.65 ) , children with mothers who did not have a postnatal medical check-up ( AOR 0.69 , 95% CI 0.56-0.86 ) and children with mothers who had not worked in the last year ( AOR 0.86 , 95% CI 0.76-0.97 ) were less likely to have received vitamin A supplementation in the last six months.
C	Coverage of childhood vitamin A supplementation was not optimum in Ethiopia and regional differences were found.
C	Lack of a maternal postnatal medical check-up , lack of ANC attendance , poorest wealth index , mother who had not worked in the last year and infant in youngest age group were associated with lower odds of receiving vitamin A supplementation over the last six months.
C	Provision and promotion of ANC and postnatal care , and strengthening routine immunization activity , especially among infants in the youngest age group , are recommended to increase coverage of childhood vitamin A supplementation.

B	Loneliness in older people is a public health concern in many Western countries.
B	While not necessarily a symptom of mental disorder , it is often associated with depression and anxiety.
B	Widowhood is a transition period during which many older people experience acute loneliness but over time develops strategies to manage it.
B	Little is known about effective strategies that older people have used to manage the experience.
B	The strategies older people used to manage this was the focus of this paper.
P	The aim was to examine older widows' experiences of loneliness.
M	The design of this study was a qualitative narrative analysis with thematic analysis and the participants were 40 older widow/widowers aged between 70 and 97 years.
R	The study found that the participants negotiated the experience of loneliness following widowhood from an acute phase of experiencing an absence and the associated loss of routine connection to the establishment of new routines that provided new connections and a new sense of identity as an individual rather than a couple.
C	It is important for mental health nurses to screen for loneliness and be able to facilitate interventions that may alleviate the experience of loneliness.
B	Given the high rates of self-harm among adolescents , recent research has focused on a better understanding of the motives for the behavior.
P	The present study had three aims: to investigate ( a ) which motives are most frequently endorsed by adolescents who report self-harm ; ( b ) whether motives reported at baseline predict repetition of self-harm over a 6-month period ; and ( c ) whether self-harm motives differ between boys and girls.
M	In all , 987 school pupils aged 14-16 years completed a lifestyle and coping questionnaire at two time points 6 months apart that recorded self-harm and the associated motives.
R	The motive "to get relief from a terrible state of mind" was the most commonly endorsed reason for self-harm ( in boys and girls ).
R	Interpersonal reasons ( e.g. , "to frighten someone" ) were least commonly endorsed.
R	Regression analyses showed that adolescents who endorsed wanting to get relief from a terrible state of mind at baseline were significantly more likely to repeat self-harm at follow-up than those adolescents who did not cite this motive.
C	The results highlight the complex nature of self-harm.
C	They have implications for mental health provision in educational settings , especially in relation to encouraging regulation of emotions and help-seeking.
B	Hepatitis B serology is complex and a lack of knowledge in interpretation contributes to the inadequate levels of screening and referral for highly effective hepatitis antiviral treatments.
B	This knowledge gap needs to be addressed so that current and future healthcare professionals are more confident in the detection and assessment of hepatitis B to improve the uptake of treatment and reduce long-term complications from the disease.
B	Cartoons have been used effectively as a teaching tool in other settings and were considered as a potentially useful teaching aid in explaining hepatitis B serology.
B	This study examines the impact of cartoons in improving healthcare professionals' knowledge.
M	A cartoon based learning tool designed to simplify the complexities of hepatitis B serology was developed as part of an online learning program for medical practitioners , nurses and students in these professions.
M	A retrospective analysis was carried out of pre and post online test results.
R	An average improvement of 96% of correct answers to case study questions in hepatitis B serology was found across all ten questions following the use of an online cartoon based learning tool.
C	The data indicates a significant improvement of participants' knowledge of hepatitis B serology from pre-test to post-test immediately following an online cartoon based learning tool.
C	However , further research is required to measure its long term impact.
B	Children with disabilities often experience delays in one or more domains of development including motor skill delays.
B	Delays in motor skill development may put children further behind their peers without disabilities in respect to aspects of early learning.
P	The purpose of this study was to examine how gross motor skills mediated the relationship of age and the observable child behaviors of compliance and adaptive behavior in a group of young children ( 2-4 years ) with developmental disabilities around one time point.
M	Children with developmental disabilities ( N = 113 ) were assessed on direct measures of motor skills and the child behaviors of compliance and adaptive behavior.
M	Two independent simple mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS , an ordinary least squares path analysis appropriate for small sample sizes.
M	Results.
M	Age had a positive relationship with gross motor skills ( a = .66 , p < .001 ) when the outcome variable was adaptive behavior and age had a positive relationship with gross motor skills ( a = .66 , p < .001 ) when the outcome variable was compliance.
C	Motor skill development may promote or hinder development in other childhood behaviors such as compliance and adaptive behavior.
P	The purpose of this study was to determine sexuality assessment knowledge , attitude , and skill of student nurses before and after sexuality training.
M	This study was conducted experimentally in a model with a pretest to posttest control group.
C	In the measurements made after training , it was observed that mean scores of Sexuality Assessment Information Test , Sexual Attitude and Beliefs Scale , and Sexuality Assessment Skills Check List in the experimental group were significantly higher than mean scores of students in the control group ( p < .05 ).
C	It was determined that sexuality assessment skills training has a positive effect on the knowledge , attitude , and behavior of nursing students.
C	Sexuality assessment skills training can provide nurses with a guide for discussing the topic of sexual health with their patients.
P	Speech-language pathologists routinely assess physical tension during evaluation of those who stutter.
P	If speakers experience tension that is not visible to clinicians , then judgments of severity may be inaccurate.
P	This study addressed this potential discrepancy by comparing judgments of tension by people who stutter and expert clinicians to determine if clinicians could accurately identify the speakers' experience of physical tension.
M	Ten adults who stutter were audio-video recorded in two speaking samples.
M	Two board-certified specialists in fluency evaluated the samples using the Stuttering Severity Instrument-4 and a checklist adapted for this study.
M	Speakers rated their tension using the same forms , and then discussed their experiences in a qualitative interview so that themes related to physical tension could be identified.
R	The degree of tension reported by speakers was higher than that observed by specialists.
R	Tension in parts of the body that were less visible to the observer ( chest , abdomen , throat ) was reported more by speakers than by specialists.
R	The thematic analysis revealed that speakers' experience of tension changes over time and that these changes may be related to speakers' acceptance of stuttering.
C	The lack of agreement between speaker and specialist perceptions of tension suggests that using self-reports is a necessary component for supporting the accurate diagnosis of tension in stuttering.

B	Illicit drug users experience various forms of discrimination which may vary by type of drug used , as there are different levels of stigma associated with different types of drugs.
P	This study investigated self-report of perceived discrimination by primary type of drug used.
M	This analysis used data from "Social Ties Associated with Risk of Transition into Injection Drug Use" ( START ) , a cross-sectional study of recently initiated injection drug users ( IDUs ) and prospective study of heroin/crack/cocaine-using non-IDUs ( n = 652 ).
M	Using log binomial regression , the relationship between primary drug used ( i.e. , single drug used most often ) with discrimination due to drug use was examined.
R	Heroin users were significantly more likely ( Prevalence ratio ( PR ): 1.52 ( 95% Confidence interval ( CI ): 1.15-2.07 ) ) to report discrimination due to drug use compared to cocaine users.
R	Conclusion and
C	More research is needed to understand the mechanism through which discrimination affects heroin users , and its potential relation with other discrimination-related outcomes , namely depression and drug treatment.
B	Symptom cluster research is an emerging field in symptom management.
B	The ability to identify symptom clusters that are specific to pediatric oncology patients may lead to improved understanding of symptoms' underlying mechanisms among patients of all ages.
P	The purpose of this study , in a sample of children and adolescents with cancer who underwent a cycle of myelosuppressive chemotherapy , was to compare the number and types of symptom clusters identified using patients' ratings of symptom occurrence and symptom severity.
M	Children and adolescents with cancer ( 10-18 years of age ; N = 131 ) completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale 10-18 on the day they started a cycle of myelosuppressive chemotherapy , using a 1-week recall of experiences.
M	Symptom data based on occurrence and severity ratings were examined using exploratory factor analysis.
M	The defined measurement model suggested by the best exploratory factor analysis model was then examined with a latent variable analysis.
R	Three clusters were identified when symptom occurrence ratings were evaluated , which were classified as a chemotherapy sequela cluster , mood disturbance cluster , and a neuropsychological discomfort cluster.
R	Analysis of symptom severity ratings yielded similar cluster configurations.
C	Cluster configurations remained relatively stable between symptom occurrence and severity ratings.
C	The evaluation of patients at a common point in the chemotherapy cycle may have contributed to these findings.
C	Additional uniformity in symptom clusters investigations is needed to allow appropriate comparisons among studies.
C	The dissemination of symptom cluster research methodology through publication and presentation may promote uniformity in this field.
B	To assess the trend associations between South Africa's economic growth using various economic growth indicators ( EGIs ) with adult obesity prevalence over a specified period of time.
M	Data for obesity levels reported were obtained from national surveys conducted in South African adults in 1998 , 2003 and 2012.
M	EGIs incorporated in the current analysis were obtained from the World Bank and IHS Global insight databases.
M	Obesity prevalence is presented by gender , urbanisation level and ethnicity.
M	EGIs congruent to the time points where obesity data are available are presented.
M	Unadjusted time trend plots were applied to assess associations between obesity prevalence and EGIs by gender , urbanisation level and ethnicity.
R	Females present higher levels of obesity relative to males for all time points.
R	For both males and females , an overall increase in prevalence was observed in both rural and urban settings over-time , with urban dwellers presenting higher obesity levels.
R	An overall increase in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita and Household Final Consumption Expenditure ( HFCE ) per capita was observed.
R	The Gini coefficient for all ethnicities except the White population increased between 1998 and 2003 but declined by 2012.
R	Overtime per capita GDP and HFCE increased with increasing obesity prevalence in both genders.
R	The trend association between the Gini coefficient for all ethnicities and obesity prevalence was similar for both genders in that as the Gini coefficient increased obesity prevalence declined , and when the coefficient decreased obesity prevalence increased.
C	Trend associations exist between South Africa's economic growth and adult obesity.
B	Our study aimed ( 1 ) to describe the proportion of psychological distress among Chinese outpatients at general hospitals , ( 2 ) to compare cognitive and behavioral characteristics of patients with different distress patterns , and ( 3 ) to investigate the discriminant function of the analyzed variables in indicating the affinity towards the different distress patterns.
M	This multicentercross-sectional study was conducted at ten outpatient departments at Chinese general hospitals.
M	The somatic symptom severity scale ( PHQ-15 ) , the nine-item depression scale ( PHQ-9 ) , and the seven-item anxiety scale ( GAD-7 ) were employed to classify patients in terms of four distress patterns.
R	A total of 491 patients were enrolled.
R	Among them , the proportion of patients with high psychological distress was significantly higher within those with high somatic distress ( 74.5% vs. 25.5% , p < .001 ).
R	Patients with psychological distress alone and mixed distress were significantly younger and with lower monthly family income , while the proportion of female patients ( 80.9% ) was highest in the somatic distress group.
R	Patients with mixed distress had the most negative cognitive and behavioral characteristics [ highest health anxiety ( 5.0 +/- 1.9 ) , lowest sense of coherence ( 35.5 +/- 10.0 ) , the worst doctor-patient relationship from both patients' ( 36.0 +/- 7.3 ) and doctors' perspectives ( 23.3 +/- 7.0 )] , as well as most impaired quality of life ( 41.6 +/- 7.4 and 31.9 +/- 10.3 ).
R	In addition , compared with patients with somatic distress alone , those with psychological distress alone had lower sense of coherence , worse doctor-patient relationship , and more impaired mental quality of life , but less doctor visits.
R	Discriminant analysis showed that gender , mental quality of life , health anxiety , sense of coherence , and frequent doctor visits were significant indicators in identifying patients with different distress patterns.
C	Our study found that ( 1 ) psychological distress was not rare in the Chinese general hospital outpatients , especially in those with high somatic distress ; ( 2 ) patients with psychological distress alone sought less help from doctors , despite their severe psychosocial impairment ; and ( 3 ) gender , health anxiety , sense of coherence , mental quality of life , and frequent doctor visits could help to identify different distress patterns.
B	The chosen method of speech assessment , including type of speech material , may affect speech judgement in children with cleft palate.
P	To assess the effect of different speech materials on speech judgement in 5-year-old children born with or without cleft palate , as well as the reliability of materials by means of intra- and inter-transcriber agreement of consonant transcriptions.
M	Altogether 40 children were studied , 20 born with cleft palate , 20 without.
M	The children were audio recorded at 5 years of age.
M	Speech materials used were: single-word naming , sentence repetition ( both developed for cleft palate speech assessment ) , retelling of a narrative and conversational speech.
M	The samples were phonetically transcribed and inter- and intra-transcriber agreement was calculated.
M	Percentage correct consonants ( PCC ) , percentage correct places ( PCP ) , percentage correct manners ( PCM ) , and percentage active cleft speech characteristics ( CSC ) were assessed.
M	In addition , an analysis of phonological simplification processes ( PSP ) was performed.
R	The PCC and CSC results were significantly more accurate in word naming than in all other speech materials in the children with cleft palate , who also achieved more accurate PCP results in word naming than in sentence repetition and conversational speech.
R	Regarding PCM and PSP , performance was significantly more accurate in word naming than in conversational speech.
R	Children without cleft palate did better , irrespective of the speech material.
R	The medians of intra- and inter-transcriber agreement were good in both groups and all speech materials.
R	The closest agreement in the cleft palate group was seen in word naming and the weakest in the retelling task.
C	The results indicate that word naming is the most reliable speech material when the purpose is to assess the best speech performance of a child with cleft palate.
C	If the purpose is to assess connected speech , sentence repetition is a reliable and also valid speech material , with good transcriber agreement and equally good articulation accuracy as in retelling and conversational speech.
C	For typically developing children without a cleft palate , the chosen speech material appears not to affect speech judgement.
P	To estimate the direct costs associated to outpatient and hospital care of diseases related to alcohol consumption in the Brazilian Unified Health System.
M	Attributable populational risks were estimated for the selected diseases related to the use of 25 g/day or more of ethanol ( risk consumption ) , considering a relative risk ( RR ) >= 1.20.
M	The RR estimates were obtained from three meta-analysis.
M	The risk consumption rates of the Brazilian population >= 18 years old were obtained by a national survey.
M	Data from the Hospital Information System of SUS ( HIS-SUS ) were used to estimate the annual costs of the health system with the diseases included in the analysis.
R	The total estimated costs for a year regarding diseases related to risk consumption were U$8 ,262 ,762 ( US$4 ,413 ,670 and US$3 ,849 ,092 , for outpatient and hospital care , respectively ).
C	Risk consumption of alcohol is an important economic and health problem , impacting significantly the health system and society.
B	Lack of access to health care is a persistent condition for most African indigents , to which the common technical approach of targeting initiatives is an insufficient antidote.
B	To overcome the standstill , an integrated technical and political approach is needed.
B	Such policy shift is dependent on political support , and on alignment of international and national actors.
B	We explore if the analytical framework of social exclusion can contribute to the latter.
M	We produce a critical and evaluative account of the literature on three themes: social exclusion , development policy , and indigence in Africa-and their interface.
M	First , we trace the concept of social exclusion as it evolved over time and space in policy circles.
M	We then discuss the relevance of a social exclusion perspective in developing countries.
M	Finally , we apply this perspective to Africa , its indigents , and their lack of access to health care.
R	The concept of social exclusion as an underlying process of structural inequalities has needed two decades to find acceptance in international policy circles.
R	Initial scepticism about the relevance of the concept in developing countries is now giving way to recognition of its universality.
R	For a variety of reasons however , the uptake of a social exclusion perspective in Africa has been limited.
R	Nevertheless , social exclusion as a driver of poverty and inequity in Africa is evident , and manifestly so in the case of the African indigents.
C	The concept of social exclusion provides a useful framework for improved understanding of origins and persistence of the access problem that African indigents face , and for generating political space for an integrated approach.
B	Residual tissue samples , i. e. , samples excised for diagnosis or during treatment , are commonly used for medical research.
B	In the Netherlands , they can be used provided the patient did not opt out of this use.
B	Previous research has shown that recall of the informed consent procedure for tissue use is poor.
B	Here , we investigate recall of three consent procedures: informed consent , opt-out , and opt-out plus ( an opt-out procedure with an information procedure similar to that of informed consent ).
M	Patients ( n = 1 ,319 ) with a variety of diseases were randomized into three trial arms: informed consent , opt-out plus , and opt-out.
M	Questionnaires were administered 6 weeks and 6 months after randomization.
R	Six hundred and seventy-three and 553 patients returned the 6-week and 6-month questionnaire , respectively.
R	In the informed consent arm , recall of having received a brochure ( 55.3% ) or oral information ( 69.4% ) was similar to that in the opt-out plus arm ( 48.5 and 71.6% , respectively ) , at the 6-week assessment.
R	Significantly more respondents in the informed consent and the opt-out plus arms versus the opt-out arm recalled that they had been informed about being able to control tissue use and which consent procedure they had experienced ( 6-week questionnaire range 53.2-75.8 vs. 13.9-16.1% ; 6-month questionnaire range 43.5-84.2 vs. 3.2-35.4% ).
R	There were no significant differences between the informed consent and opt-out plus arms in this regard.
C	Recall of the consent procedure was similar in opt-out plus and informed consent procedures.
C	Overall , recall was moderate , indicating that there is room for improvement in the quality of information provision.

B	Stigmatizing attitudes against anorexia nervosa ( AN ) may act as barriers to treatment.
P	Evaluated college students' perceptions of AN as compared to major depressive disorder ( MDD ).
M	One-hundred two female undergraduates read vignettes describing targets with mild or severe MDD or AN , then rated biological , vanity , and self-responsibility attributions ; feelings of admiration , sympathy , and anger ; and behavioral dispositions toward coercion into treatment , imitation , and social distance.
R	AN was perceived more negatively than MDD in terms of vanity attributions , selfresponsibility attributions , and feelings of anger , but more positively in terms of admiration and imitation.
C	This research demonstrates stigma-related mixed messages received by individuals with AN , which might be useful in improving eating disorders mental health literacy.
P	Synthetic cannabinoid products have been increasingly used by adolescents for the past few years , but little literature exists describing their psychoactive and physical effects.
P	This study describes the psychoactive and physical effects of synthetic cannabinoids as reported by adolescent users.
M	This study reviewed the records of 11 individuals aged 15-19 years who were evaluated at the South Miami Hospital Addiction Treatment Center in Miami-Dade County , Florida.
M	The average age of the subjects was 17.3 years ( standard deviation = 1.35 ; range ( R ) = 15 , 19 ) ; 10 of 11 ( 91% ) were male and 10 of 11 were Hispanic.
M	The charts of youth who admitted use of synthetic cannabinoids were reviewed.
M	Demographic information , characteristics of the substance , and descriptions of the psychoactive and physical effects were abstracted from the standardized , semi-structured clinician interviews.
R	All the subjects reported a feeling of euphoria and memory changes.
R	Nine ( 82% ) reported negative mood changes.
R	Marijuana and alcohol use was also reported by 10 ( 91% ) subjects.
R	The number of other drugs used was significantly correlated with the frequency of synthetic cannabinoid use ( r = .896 , p < .05 ).
C	Adolescent synthetic cannabinoid product users report significant psychoactive effects.

B	The move for educational reform to improve student outcomes and learning has been the subject of ongoing debate over the last 15 years in Australia and internationally.
B	In Australia , Game Centred Approaches ( GCA ) such as Game Sense have been positioned by advocates as having the capacity to achieve these characteristics in physical education.
B	However , despite some 15 years of exposure to , and professional development in , GCA in Australia , there has been very little change in teaching practices in games and sports.
P	The paper will focus on physical education teacher education ( PETE ) undergraduates' attitudes to games and sports and analyse key issues related to their understandings relating to the use of a GCA.
M	The participants were second and third year PETE undergraduates during their practical studies courses in Games and Sports.
M	Data was collected from PETE undergraduates over a three-year period.
M	The exchanges used in this paper were from recordings of consultations , interactions in tutorials and in assessment presentations.
M	They were supported by the first author's own observations on students' understandings of the GCA during and following tutorials.
M	PETE students were involved in four practical studies courses in games and sports with the first author using a GCA approach.
M	Required readings and journal articles on GCA were used to support course content.
M	To understand the students' understandings of games and sports using a GCA and the qualitative nature of inquiry , an ethnomethodological approach was used.
M	The analysis of the data based on Lemke's theory of social semiotics was conducted to develop an understanding of what using a GCA meant to the students in action ( the events in which the meanings are used ) and in context ( how the meaning is demonstrated when connected to an event ).
R	The findings of this paper were threefold.
R	Firstly , the influence of traditional approaches to games and sports in the physical education and sporting backgrounds of the PETE students is a very powerful force in determining how games and sports should be taught and understood.
R	Secondly , the students' capacity to productively and consistently use a GCA to create these learning environments is contingent on the depth of their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge.
R	Thirdly , there is a considerable emotional cost to the students when challenging their embodied investments in a traditional sports model.
C	Understanding and developing sustainability to use a GCA requires more than simply exposing students to the approach.
C	If GCAs are to be used appropriately to enhance the quality of teaching and student learning and create the environments advocates believe are possible , then how we teach PETE students to teach games and sports in our courses must be examined and we must ask ourselves this question in relation to teaching using a GCA: How do we do what we do?
B	Clinical guidelines for the management of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) recommend against the use of benzodiazepines.
B	Benzodiazepines and PTSD are both associated with addiction-related risks.
B	The Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) prescribing trends show continued use of benzodiazepines and polysedative use in veterans with PTSD , particularly in rural areas.
B	The authors examine the use of an educational intervention to improve pharmacologic management of veterans with PTSD in rural clinics.
M	The VA Academic Detailing Service Informatics Toolset provides prescribing , demographic and risk factor data for veterans with PTSD treated at the White River Junction VA Medical Center ( WRJ VA ) and affiliated rural clinics in Vermont and New Hampshire.
M	Individualized academic detailing visits were provided to clinicians identified by the informatics tool with the aim of increasing guideline-concordant care.
M	Other educational efforts included traditional , didactic group education on evidence-based PTSD care and the development and dissemination of educational materials for clinicians and patients.
M	Prescribing trends of benzodiazepines , off-label atypical antipsychotics , and prazosin were collected quarterly for 3 years ( October 1 , 2013 , to September 30 , 2016 ).
R	Prescribing rates of benzodiazepines during the educational intervention decreased from 13% to 9.3%.
R	Use of off-label atypical antipsychotics , a class of medications not recommended for PTSD , stayed relatively flat at about 10%.
R	Prescribing of prazosin , a medication recommended for treatment of trauma nightmares , increased from 9.8% to 14.3%.
C	Academic detailing and other educational programming appear to be effective for addressing gaps and lag in quality PTSD care and are associated with a positive trend of decreased benzodiazepine use.
C	Efforts will continue , now with added focus on concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids and the use of off-label atypical antipsychotics in rural veterans with PTSD.
B	Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) affects approximately 1% of all live births today.
B	With improvements in diagnostic , medical , surgical , and interventional procedures , 85% or more of all infants with CHD will reach adulthood.
B	The number of adults living with CHD has been estimated to exceed 1 million and now exceeds the number of pediatric CHD patients.
B	Because residual problems following intervention for congenital heart lesions can present during the adult years and complicate the well-being of these patients , ongoing care is warranted.
B	Adult care providers have a limited knowledge of the complexities of CHD.
B	The American College of Cardiology recommends the establishment of adult CHD clinics with both pediatric and adult cardiologists.
B	Although our clinic is located in a pediatric hospital , little attention has been placed on where these clinics should be located-an adult setting or a pediatric setting.
B	We sought to determine the adult CHD patient's perspective on being seen in a pediatric setting.
P	The objective of the study was to determine the perspective of adults with CHD receiving follow-up care in a pediatric setting.
M	A pilot 11-question anonymous patient satisfaction survey with no personal identifiers and no diagnoses was sent to all patients who had attended the adult congenital heart disease clinic at our pediatric hospital medical center during a 2-year period.
R	From our respondents , 96% did not have any concerns with being seen in a pediatric setting for adult congenital heart care , and 98% would recommend our clinic to other patients.
C	Care for the adult with CHD involves multiple care providers.
C	The most important finding from the patient's perspective is knowledge of the complexities of congenital heart lesions and possible future complications.
C	There was little impact from being seen in a pediatric hospital setting.
B	A systematic method of symptom assessment in patients with acute coronary syndromes is important for disease recognition and initiation of early treatment.
B	However , such assessment in Chinese people is hindered by the lack of a psychometrically sound instrument.
P	To develop the Chinese version of the Symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndromes Inventory ( SACSI-C ) and to evaluate its psychometric properties for Chinese patients.
M	SACSI was translated from English into Chinese according to Brislin's model.
M	Its content validity and face validity were evaluated.
M	A sample of 114 acute coronary syndromes patients was recruited from the cardiac units of two hospitals in Hong Kong.
M	The reliability was assessed by one-day test-retest reliability.
M	The known-groups validity was evaluated by its ability to differentiate patients with typical versus atypical symptom presentation in older ( >= 75 years ) and younger ( <75 years ) groups.
R	The Item-Content Validity Index of the SACSI-C was computed as 0.88-1.00.
R	The Scale-Content Validity Index was computed as 0.99.
R	The intraclass correlation coefficients of all items of the symptom subscale were above 0.75 , except for item 16.
R	The kappa values of all items in the symptom location and quality subscales were above 0.663.
R	The test-retest reliability was good.
R	The known-groups validity was evident , as demonstrated by the results of Chi-square test ( p=0.007 ) and logistic regression analysis ( odds ratio=2.9 , p=0.039 ) , showing that older patients were significantly more likely to have atypical symptom presentation.
C	The psychometric properties of the SACSI-C are satisfactory and could be used to assess acute coronary syndromes symptomatology in Chinese.
B	Understanding and monitoring the prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection among premarital clients and determining discordant rate and applying specific interventions targeted at this group could bring dual benefits as it prevents both heterosexual and vertical transmission of the disease.
P	To assess the prevalence of HIV and diseordant rate and factors associated with them among premarital voluntary counseling and testing ( VCT ) clients in public VCT centers in Addis Ababa.
M	A cross-sectional facility-based study was conducted from March to April 2008.
M	Seven public VCT centers were selected using simple random sampling.
M	Then all consecutive premarital VCT clients were interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire.
R	Of the 392 premarital VCT clients who participated in the study , 8.2% were sero-positive.
R	HIV sero-status was significantly Associated with the number of lifetime sexual partners ( AOR ( 95%CI ) = 9.06 ( 2.66-30.83 ) ) , previous history of HIV testing ( AOR ( 95%CI ) =6.70 ( 2.32-19.35 ) ) and type of VCT service utilization ( AOR ( 95%CI ) = 4.17 ( 1.53-11.36 ) ).
R	Out of the 138 couples , 6.5% were found to be sero-discordant , while concordant negatives and concordant positives accounted for 92.0% and 1.4% respectively.
R	Both HIV sero-positivity and discordance were relatively higher among those who were previously separated/divorced and widowed.
R	Conclusion and recommendation: As considerable prevalence of sem-positivity and sero-discordant among , premarital couples were observed in this study , every effort needs to be made to make premarital couples become aware of their own and their partners' sero-status before engagement.

B	Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability among the Korean population.
B	Ischemic stroke patients tend to delay arrival at the hospital and often miss the "golden" 3-hour window , which is optimal for tissue plasminogen activator treatment.
P	The purposes of this study were to compare demographic , clinical/behavioral , and sociocultural characteristics of ischemic stroke patients who reside in urban and rural areas of Korea and to identify factors contributing to the time taken from symptom onset to hospital arrival.
M	A cross-sectional , descriptive study was conducted using a structured survey in a convenience sample of 229 ischemic stroke patients in Korea.
R	Individuals who resided in rural areas were more likely to be female , older , less educated ; had lower incomes ; contacted adult children at the onset of stroke ; and took a longer time to be transported to a hospital than did those who resided in urban areas ( P < .05 ).
R	Patients who visited an emergency room , transferred via an ambulance , contacted emergency medical services , perceived symptoms as serious , had a family history of stroke , or experienced hemiparesis as the primary stroke symptom arrived at the hospital relatively sooner , whereas patients who experienced unclear symptoms took relatively more time to arrive at the hospital following symptom onset ( P < .05 ).
C	Nationwide efforts are needed to promote public awareness of stroke and to develop strategies to reduce prehospital delay time for ischemic stroke patients , particularly those who reside in rural areas in Korea.
B	Concern has been expressed about the potentially contagious effect of television soap opera suicides and suicidal language in social media.
P	Twitter content was analyzed during the week in which a fictional assisted suicide was broadcast on a British television soap opera , "Coronation Street."
M	Tweets were collected if they contained language indicating possible suicidal intent or used the word suicide.
M	The modified Thompson tau method was used to test for any differences in the volume of tweets in both categories on the day of screening.
M	Content analysis broke down the use of the word suicide into six thematic categories.
R	There was no evidence on the day of screening of an increase in tweets expressing possible suicidal intent but there was an increase in tweets containing the word suicide.
R	Content analysis found the most common thematic category to be information or support , followed by the raising of moral issues in relation to suicide.
C	It is possible that for certain high-profile media events Twitter may be used more as a civic reactive forum than as a medium for introspection or disclosure of distress.
B	Suicide rates in Korea have increased dramatically.
B	Stroke is considered one of the most debilitating neurological disorders , resulting in physical impairment , disability , and death.
P	The present study attempted to examine factors related to suicidal ideation in community-dwelling stroke patients.
M	The Korea Welfare Panel Study was used to investigate the relationship between demographic and psychological variables and suicidal ideation among these individuals.
M	Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 11 ( CES-D-11 ).
M	Self-esteem was assessed using Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale.
R	The prevalence of suicidal thought among stroke patients was estimated at 13.99%.
R	Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that both older age and depression were significant independent risk factors for suicidal ideation.
C	High-priority health care plans can prevent suicide in stroke patients suffering from depression.
C	Assessing risk for suicide and monitoring the high-risk group is integral to health care.
C	Stroke patients with depression , particularly older patients , would be prime targets for suicide intervention programs.
B	Women report higher rates of depression and anxiety than men ; however , it is uncertain whether this gender difference continues into advanced old age.
M	78 men and 111 women aged 82-87 years from the Men , Women and Ageing Project completed measures of anxiety ( Geriatric Anxiety Inventory ) , depression ( Patient Health Questionnaire ; PHQ9 ) , general psychological well-being ( Mental Health subscale of SF-36 ) , general health ( general health item of SF-36 ) and cognitive status ( Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status ; TICS ).
R	Results revealed no significant gender differences on any of the psychological measures , after controlling for cognitive status , general health and education.
C	These results support the proposition that the female predominance in psychological distress diminishes with increasing age.
C	The congruence between men and women may reflect changes in identity associated with age or the effect of decreased emotional valence of some social roles.
B	Clinical screening for basic social needs-such as food and housing insecurity-is becoming more common as health systems develop programs to address social determinants of health.
B	Clinician attitudes toward such programs are largely unexplored.
P	To describe the attitudes and experiences of social needs screening among a variety of clinicians and other health care professionals.
M	Multicenter electronic and paper-based survey.
M	Two hundred fifty-eight clinicians including primarily physicians , social workers , nurses , and pharmacists from a large integrated health system in Southern California.
M	Level of agreement with prompts exploring attitudes toward and barriers to screening and addressing social needs in different clinical settings.
R	Overall , most health professionals supported social needs screening in clinical settings ( 84% ).
R	Only a minority ( 41% ) of clinicians expressed confidence in their ability to address social needs , and less than a quarter ( 23% ) routinely screen for social needs currently.
R	Clinicians perceived lack of time to ask ( 60% ) and resources ( 50% ) to address social needs as their most significant barriers.
R	We found differences by health profession in attitudes toward and barriers to screening for social needs , with physicians more likely to cite time constraints as a barrier.
C	Clinicians largely support social needs programs , but they also recognize key barriers to their implementation.
C	Health systems interested in implementing social needs programs should consider the clinician perspective around the time and resources required for such programs and address these perceived barriers.
B	Non-English-speaking developing countries in Southeast Asia have been provided only limited opportunities for faculty development in the education of health professions.
B	Although there exist a few programs that have been shown to be effective , they are frequently presented with few explanations on how and why the programs work due to their outcome-oriented nature.
B	This study explores the process of the Lee Jong-Wook Fellowship for Health Professional Education , an international faculty development program designed for capacity building of educators of health professions in Southeast Asian developing countries.
M	Fellows were from Cambodia , Myanmar , and Laos.
M	Qualitative data were collected from two types of semi-structured interviews - group and individual.
M	Thematic analysis was conducted to explore the factors related to the effectiveness of the program , framed by four components of faculty development , which included context , facilitators , program , and participants.
R	From the thematic analysis , the authors identified a total of 12 themes in the four components of faculty development.
R	In the context domain , the resource-poor setting , a culture that puts emphasis on hierarchy and seniority , and educational environment depending on individual commitment rather than broad consensus emerged as key factors.
R	In the facilitators domain , their teaching methods and materials , mutual understanding between teacher and learner , and collaboration between facilitators mainly influenced the learning during the fellowship.
R	In the program domain , the key advantages of the fellowship program were its applicability to the workplace of the fellows and enough allowed time for practice and reflection.
R	Finally , in the participants domain , Fellows valued their heterogeneity of composition and recognized cognitive as well as non-cognitive attributes of the participants as essential.
C	This process-oriented evaluation reveals the diverse factors that contributed to achieving the intended outcomes of the fellowship.
C	Although much evidence from best practices in faculty development are still valid , the findings suggest that the selection strategies , learning environment , and English communication should be given more consideration when organizing a program targeting these people and cultures.
C	A comprehensive understanding of the process would contribute to developing tailored strategies for educators of health professions in developing countries in similar settings.
B	Impulsivity has been proposed as an important factor in the initiation and maintenance of addiction.
B	Indirect evidence suggests that some methamphetamine users report less impulsivity when they are using methamphetamine compared to when abstaining from drug use , but this hypothesis has not been directly tested.
B	Objectives/
M	In this study , self-reports of impulsivity were obtained from 32 methamphetamine-dependent ( DSM-IV ) research participants and 41 healthy control subjects , using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11.
M	The methamphetamine users were assessed during an active period of methamphetamine use , as determined through urinalysis , and again after approximately 1 week of confirmed abstinence.
M	Control subjects likewise completed two assessments.
M	A subset of participants also completed serial assessments of the Beck Depression Inventory ( Methamphetamine Group , N = 17 , Control Group , N = 38 ) and the Methamphetamine Withdrawal Questionnaire ( Methamphetamine Group , N = 12 ).
R	There was a significant interaction of group with time on impulsivity ( p = 0.044 ) , reflecting a significant increase from the first to the second assessment in the methamphetamine users ( p = 0.013 ) , but no change among healthy control subjects.
R	In contrast , depressive and withdrawal symptoms significantly decreased between the first and second assessments in the methamphetamine users ( ps =0.01 ).
R	Change in impulsivity in methamphetamine users was not significantly correlated with change in withdrawal or depression ( ps >0.05 ).
C	These findings suggest that methamphetamine users report more impulsivity when abstaining from drug use , an effect that is not significantly related to methamphetamine withdrawal.
C	Attenuation of impulsivity may reinforce continued methamphetamine use in these individuals.
B	Occupational therapists in many countries routinely perform predischarge home visits.
B	Although there have been repeated calls to ascertain whether predischarge home visits are clinically and cost effective , there has been a tendency to neglect users' perceptions and experiences of this intervention.
P	The objective was to conduct a systematic thematic synthesis of older adults' perceptions and experiences of predischarge home visits.
M	The search strategy was an electronic database search.
M	Conference proceedings were hand searched and universities and occupational therapy professional bodies within Europe , Australia and North America were contacted.
R	Forty-four studies were initially identified , of which 13 studies ( 7 published , 6 unpublished ) were selected for detailed screening.
R	Only three qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria and , from this synthesis , two main themes emerged from the data.
R	The first theme was older adults' perceptions of home visits and the second theme was acceptance of occupational therapy.
C	Only a limited body of research has been conducted.
C	This is surprising given the number of predischarge home visits that are performed.
C	This thematic synthesis of qualitative research has highlighted that insufficient attention has been paid to older adults' perceptions of predischarge home visits.
P	The principal aim of this study was to determine the hospital-acquired pressure injury ( HAPI ) rate before and after introduction of a repositioning device , measure staff-perceived level of exertion with device use , and assess return on investment.
M	1 group , before-and-after study.
M	The sample comprised 717 patients cared for in a 17-bed intensive care unit.
M	The study setting was the neonatal intensive care unit at Bon Secours Maryview Medical Center located in the mid-Atlantic United States ( Portsmouth , Virginia ).
M	A safe patient-handling intervention was implemented as part of a quality improvement initiative.
M	The effect of this system was measured using several outcome measures: ( 1 ) HAPI occurrences on the sacral area and buttocks , ( 2 ) perceived effort of use by staff , and ( 3 ) cost analysis.
M	We used the validated Borg Scale to measure perceived exertion that was ranked on a scale from 6 to 20 , where higher scores indicate greater exertion.
M	Cost comparisons were completed before and after introduction of the patient-repositioning system.
M	Cost analysis was determined using internal dollar amounts calculated for each stage of pressure injury.
M	The return on investment was calculated by comparing the cost of HAPIs and the product after the intervention with the costs of HAPIs before the intervention.
R	Analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in HAPI occurrence from 1.3% to 0% ( P = .004 ) when baseline manual repositioning ( standard of care ) was compared with use of the repositioning system.
R	Caregivers reported significantly less exertion when using the repositioning device as compared with standard of care repositioning ( P < .001 ).
R	The return on investment was estimated to be $16 ,911.
C	Use of a repositioning device resulted in significantly reduced HAPIs.
C	Perceived exertion for repositioning the patient with a repositioning device was significantly less than repositioning with standard of care.
C	A cost analysis estimated a return on investment as a result of the intervention on HAPI prevention.
B	The General Medical Council's Fitness to Practise investigations may involve a test of competence for doctors with performance concerns.
B	Concern has been raised about the suitability of the test format for doctors who qualified before the introduction of Single Best Answer and Objective Structured Clinical Examination assessments , both of which form the test of competence.
B	This study explored whether the examination formats used in the tests of competence are fair to long standing doctors who have undergone fitness to practise investigation.
M	A retrospective cohort design was used to determine an association between year of primary medical qualification and doctors' test of competence performance.
M	Performance of 95 general practitioners under investigation was compared with a group of 376 volunteer doctors.
M	We analysed performance on knowledge test , OSCE overall , and three individual OSCE stations using Spearman's correlation and regression models.
R	Doctors under investigation performed worse on all test outcomes compared to the comparison group.
R	Qualification year correlated positively with performance on all outcomes except for physical examination ( e.g. knowledge test r = 0.48 , p < 0.001 and OSCE r = 0.37 , p < 0.001 ).
R	Qualification year was associated with test performance in doctors under investigation even when controlling for sex , ethnicity and qualification region.
R	Regression analyses showed that qualification year was associated with knowledge test , OSCE and communication skills performance of doctors under investigation when other variables were controlled for.
R	Among volunteer doctors this was not the case and their performance was more strongly related to where they qualified and their ethnic background.
R	Furthermore , volunteer doctors who qualified before the introduction of Single Best Answer and OSCE assessments , still outperformed their peers under investigation.
C	Earlier graduates under fitness to practise investigation performed less well on the test of competence than their more recently qualified peers under investigation.
C	The performance of the comparator group tended to stay consistent irrespective of year qualified.
C	Our results suggest that the test format does not disadvantage early qualified doctors.
C	We discuss findings in relation to the GMC's fitness to practise procedures and suggest alternative explanations for the poorer performance of long standing doctors under investigation.
B	In a health-care service with the emphasis on improvement related to functioning and well-being , the communication process between patient and professionals is essential.
B	There is a lack of research on this matter.
P	The aim was to investigate , in a group of severely mentally ill persons , whether the use of a simple communication tool could influence the sense of empowerment , satisfaction with care , therapeutic alliance and unmet needs.
M	The study had a cluster randomized design.
M	The intervention was a communication tool ( 2-COM ) applied in two teams during one year.
M	In a comparison group of two other teams , the treatment was as usual.
M	At baseline , after six months , and after one year , assessments were made.
R	After one year the 2-COM groups seemed to have a larger reduction in unmet needs compared to the treatment-as-usual group.
R	However , there were large problems with attrition in the study , and it was not possible to draw relevant conclusions.
C	The methodological problems were substantial , and the study may be considered as a pilot study.
C	In a main study the researchers ought to take control over the selection of patients on the basis of the experiences from this study.
P	Breathing and swallowing problems affect elderly people and may be related to age-associated tongue dysfunction.
P	Hypoglossal motoneurons that innervate the tongue receive a robust , excitatory serotonergic ( 5HT ) input and may be affected by aging.
P	We used a rat model of aging and progressive resistance tongue exercise to determine whether age-related alterations in 5HT inputs to the hypoglossal nucleus can be modified.
P	We hypothesized that tongue forces would increase with exercise , 5HT input to the tongue would decrease with age , and tongue exercise would augment 5HT input to the hypoglossal nucleus.
M	Young ( 9-10 months ) , middle-aged ( 24-25 months ) , and old ( 32-33 months ) male F344/BN rats received tongue exercise for 8 weeks.
M	Immunoreactivity for 5HT was measured in digital images of sections through the hypoglossal nucleus using ImageJ software.
R	Tongue exercise resulted in increased maximum tongue forces at all ages.
R	There was a statistically significant increase in 5HT immunoreactivity in the hypoglossal nucleus in exercised , young rats but only in the caudal third of the nucleus and primarily in the ventral half.
C	Specificity found in serotonergic input following exercise may reflect the topographic organization of motoneurons in the hypoglossal nucleus and the tongue muscles engaged in the exercise paradigm.
B	Hospitals across the United States are pursuing strategies to reduce avoidable readmissions but the evidence on how best to accomplish this goal is mixed , with no specific clinical practice shown to reduce readmissions consistently.
B	Changes to hospital organizational practices , a key component of context , also may be critical to improving performance on readmissions , but this has not been studied.
P	The aim of this study was to understand how high-performing hospitals improved risk-stratified readmission rates , and whether their changes to clinical practices and organizational practices differed from low-performing hospitals.
M	This was a qualitative study of 10 hospitals in which readmission rates had decreased ( n = 7 ) or increased ( n = 3 ).
M	A total of 82 hospital staff drawn from hospitals that had participated in the State Action on Avoidable Readmissions quality improvement initiative.
R	High-performing hospitals were distinguished by several organizational practices that facilitated readmissions reduction , that is , collective habits of action or interpretation shared by organization members.
R	First , high-performing hospitals reported focused efforts to improve collaboration across hospital departments.
R	Second , they helped postacute providers improve care by sharing the hospital's clinical and quality improvement expertise and data.
R	Third , high performers enthusiastically engaged in trial and error learning to reduce readmissions.
R	Fourth , they emphasized that re-admissions represented bad outcomes for patients , de-emphasizing the role of financial penalties.
R	Both high-performing and low-performing hospitals had implemented most clinical practice changes commonly recommended to reduce readmissions.
C	Our findings highlight several organizational practices that hospitals may be able to use to enhance the effectiveness of their readmissions reduction efforts.
B	Schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations ( AVH ) have reduced structural integrity in the left arcuate fasciculus ( AFL ) compared to healthy controls.
B	However , it is neither known whether these changes are specific to AVH , as opposed to hallucinations or schizophrenia per se , nor how radial and/or axial diffusivity are altered.
B	This study aimed to test the hypothesis that reductions to the structural integrity of the AFL are specifically associated with AVH in schizophrenia.
M	Diffusion tensor imaging scans and clinical data were obtained from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank for 39 schizophrenia patients with lifetime AVH ( 18 current , 21 remitted ) , 74 schizophrenia patients with no lifetime AVH ( 40 with lifetime hallucinations in other modalities , 34 no lifetime hallucinations ) and 40 healthy controls.
R	Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced in the AFL of patients with life time AVH compared to both healthy controls ( Cohen's d=1.24 ) and patients without life time AVH ( d=.72 ) , including compared to the specific subsets of patientswithout AVH who either had hallucinations in other modalities ( d=.69 ) or no history of any hallucinations ( d=.73 ).
R	Radial , but not axial , diffusivity was significantly increased in patientswith lifetime AVH compared to both healthy controls ( d=.89 ) and patients without lifetime AVH ( d=.39 ).
R	Evidence was found for a non-linear relation between fractional anisotropy in the AFL and state AVH.
C	Reduced integrity of the AFL is specifically associated with AVH , as opposed to schizophrenia in general or hallucinations in other modalities.
C	Increased radial diffusivity suggests dysmyelination or demyelination of the AFL may play a role in AVH.

B	Pharmacists need to demonstrate knowledge of and have confidence in Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) therapeutic equivalence ( TE ) standards to improve acceptance of generic medicines amongst patients and other healthcare professionals.
P	To evaluate community pharmacists' understanding , interpretation and perceptions of the FDA TE standards to identify if further education is needed on this topic.
M	An anonymous , 13-item survey was piloted and then distributed by e-mail to a random sample of 287 Indiana community pharmacists.
M	The 5-min survey included demographic , knowledge-based , and perception-based questions on FDA TE criteria that participants were given one week to complete.
M	Participants completed the survey using a Web-based survey tool ( Qualtrics ).
R	192 pharmacists completed the survey achieving a response rate of 66.9%.
R	Only 7.3% of respondents correctly identified FDA bioequivalence criteria for approval of generic drug products.
R	Two questions presented TE codes from the Orange Book and asked respondents to identify if a pair of drug products were therapeutically equivalent: 62.6% and 61.0% of respondents answered correctly.
R	However , 89.4% of respondents correctly indicated that the Orange Book is the location of FDA TE evaluations.
R	74.9% of responding pharmacists indicated a positive perception of the rigor of FDA approval standards associated with generic medications and 66.0% believed that generic drug products made by different manufacturers are of similar quality.
C	The results suggest that community pharmacists need additional education on the interpretation of TE codes and FDA bioequivalence criteria for approval of generic drug products.
C	The safety and efficacy of generics are often questioned by patients and physicians.
C	It is important for pharmacists to be knowledgeable of FDA TE standards as they are experts in medicines and need to be confident with the criteria to effectively convey them to patients and healthcare professionals.
B	The aim of this paper was to describe the development of an intervention that is developed to improve communication about the heart failure ( HF ) trajectory and end-of-life care.
B	We also present data that provides a first insight in specific areas of feasibility of the intervention.
M	Co-design was used and patients , family members and health care professionals were constructive participants in the design process of the intervention.
M	Feasibility of the intervention was tested in two areas ; acceptability and limited efficacy.
R	Two communication tools were designed and evaluated ; 1 ) a Question Prompt List ( QPL ) for patients and family members and 2 ) a communication course for professionals which was web -based with one face-to-face training day with simulation.
R	Data on feasibility was collected with questionnaires that were developed for this study , from the 13 participants who completed the course ( all nurses ).
R	They reported improved knowledge , confidence and skills to discuss the HF trajectory and end-of-life care.
R	The QPL was evaluated to be a useful tool in communication with patients and family members.
C	In a co-design process , future users identified the need for a QPL and a communication course.
C	These communication tools can be used as a dual intervention to improve communication about the HF trajectory and end-of-life care.
C	The QPL can help patients and families to ask questions about the HF trajectory and end-of-life care.
C	The communication course can prepare the professionals to be knowledgeable , confident and skilled to discuss the questions in the QPL.
C	Before the tools are ready for implementation in clinical practice , further studies testing the feasibility of the intervention are needed , including also patients and their families.
B	Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening is underutilized.
B	Effective methods to increase screening use are needed.
B	This study sought to determine the impact of tailored navigation on CRC screening in primary care.
M	The study included 154 primary care practice patients who were 50 or more years of age , were eligible for CRC screening , and had an office visit within 2 years before study initiation.
M	Baseline telephone survey data were collected on participant sociodemographic characteristics , psychosocial factors , and screening test [fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) or colonoscopy] decision stage.
M	By comparing decision stage data , we identified that test with the highest decision stage ( ie , preferred screening test ).
M	Participants who preferred FOBT were sent an FOBT kit and a reminder.
M	Those preferring colonoscopy were sent colonoscopy instructions.
M	After this mailing , a study patient navigator made a telephone call to guide participants towards screening.
M	Six-month end point survey and medical records data were obtained.
M	Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of screening and of change in preferred screening test decision stage.
R	At end point , 63 ( 41% ) study participants had screened.
R	From baseline to end point , overall screening preference increased for 75 ( 63% ) participants.
R	Age and perceived salience and coherence ( ie , screening is important and sensible ) were positive , significant predictors of screening use ( P = 0.02 and P = 0.05 , respectively ) ; while only age predicted change in overall screening preference ( P = 0.03 ).
C	Study participant screening use and preference increased.
C	Age and attitudes predicted outcomes.
C	Randomized trials are needed to determine intervention impact at the population level.
P	This article explores the implications of outsourcing the evaluation function in South Africa , a context where there is a mismatch between evaluation supply and demand.
P	It unpacks the tradeoffs between internal and external evaluation , and challenges some commonly held assumptions about both.
M	Based on experiences as an internal evaluator , external evaluator , evaluation manager , and building evaluation capacity , the author explores how each role changes when evaluation is a scarce skill , and looks at implications outsourcing has for both the organization , and the evaluation.
R	The purpose of the evaluation must drive the decision to outsource.
R	However , with changing models of collaboration , there may be hybrid options that allow organizations to build evaluation capacity.
C	Organisations are faced with a trade-off between commissioning an evaluation , and building internal evaluation capacity.
C	To better understand each approach , it is important to consider the purpose and context of the evaluation.
C	This shifts some commonly held assumptions about internal and external evaluations.
C	Re-examining these assumptions will help organizations make a more informed decision about an evaluation approach.
P	The field of evaluation is particularly concerned with evaluation use.
P	Most of the literature on this has focused on the approach of individual evaluators , and insufficient attention has been paid to the institutional architecture of the evaluation.
P	This article considers how some of the organisational structures around an evaluation contribute to evidence use , and the case study of South Africa also shifts the focus to the central but overlooked role of context in the debate.
B	Increased ankle muscle coactivation during gait represents an adaptation strategy to compensate for postural instability in adults after stroke.
B	Although increased ankle muscle coactivation is correlated with gait disorders in adults after stroke , it remains unclear which physical impairments are the most predictive clinical factors explaining ankle muscle coactivation during gait.
P	To investigate these physical impairments in adults after stroke using stepwise multiple regression analyses.
M	The magnitude of ankle muscle coactivation during gait was quantified with a coactivation index ( CoI ) for the first and second double support ( DS2 ) , and single support ( SS ) phases in 44 community-dwelling adults after stroke.
M	Paretic motor function , sensory function , spasticity , ankle muscle strength , and balance ability were evaluated.
R	The regression analysis revealed that the balance ability and paretic ankle plantarflexor muscle strength were significant factors determining the CoI during the SS phase on the paretic side.
R	For the CoI during the DS2 phase on the paretic side , only the balance ability was selected as a significant factor.
C	Adults with impaired balance ability and paretic ankle muscle weakness after stroke used a compensation strategy of increased ankle muscle coactivation on the paretic side to enhance postural stability during gait.
B	Children with disabilities have lower physical activity levels and participate less in community-based sport and exercise programs than do children without disabilities.
B	This in part is due to environmental barriers and lack of appropriate resources in these programs.
B	Adaptive programs encouraging increased physical activity for children with disabilities are needed , and as these programs are developed , they should be critically evaluated.
P	The purposes of this article are to describe a pilot aquatic exercise program for children with disabilities , to evaluate the program , and to determine areas of strength and areas needing modifications.
M	A summative program evaluation design was used to assess this twice per week aquatic exercise program lasting 14 weeks.
M	Sixteen children , ages 6-12 years , with developmental disabilities participated in the program.
M	Children swam laps , participated in relay races and water basketball games , and performed arm and leg strengthening exercises using aquatic noodles , foam barbells , and water for resistance.
M	Swimming skills , program evaluation questionnaires , physical activity questionnaires , and interviews of pool site directors were used to determine program outcomes.
R	Findings suggest that children made improvements in their swimming skills , parents were satisfied with the program , and children increased their physical activity levels during the program and maintained the increased physical activity levels six months after the program ended.
R	The program continued in some form after the 14-week intervention ended.
C	The program was successful in achieving its objectives and recommendations for application of this program are provided.

B	The present study is an evaluation of a self-collected urine dip ( SCUD ) swab as an alternative sampling method for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) in urine samples that conforms to postal service regulations in Australia.
M	Sixty urine samples , previously identified as CT positive were used to prepare SCUD swabs in vitro.
M	In addition , replicate SCUD swabs were prepared from known CT positive urine samples and stored at room temperature , or sent through the postal system.
M	All samples were tested for CT and an inhibition control using the Roche TaqMan 48 Real-time polymerase chain reaction system.
R	Overall , 58/60 ( 97% ) SCUD swabs generated positive CT results.
R	Triplicate SCUD swabs prepared from five known positive urine samples and stored up to 7 days at room temperature , showed positive results in all samples.
R	Ten replicates of SCUD swabs from five known CT positive samples were also tested after being posted from different regions in Australia , with a transit time of 2-7 days , back to the Melbourne laboratory.
R	There was 94% positivity of the SCUD swab samples.
C	The present study demonstrated SCUD swabs to be a sensitive and robust method of self-collecting samples for detection of CT subsequent to sending the samples through the postal service.
B	Strength training can increase function in individuals with stroke.
B	However it is unclear which type of strength training is most effective and feasible.
P	To assess the effect and feasibility of an intervention combining eccentric and task-oriented strength training in individuals with chronic stroke.
M	Eleven participants were randomly assigned to a group first receiving four weeks of eccentric strength training and then four weeks of task-oriented strength training ( EST-TOST ) or vice versa ( TOST-EST ).
M	Strength and upper limb function were administered with a hand-held dynamometer ( HHD ) and the Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) respectively.
M	Feasibility was evaluated with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) , the adherence and drop-out rate.
R	Significant increases were found in ARAT score ( mean difference 7.3 ; p < 0.05 ) and in shoulder and elbow strength ( mean difference respectively 23.96 N ; p < 0.001 and 27.41 N ; p < 0.003 ).
R	Participants rated both EST and TOST with 81% on the IMI , the adherence rate was high and there was one drop-out.
C	The results of this study show that a combination of eccentric and task-oriented strength training is an effective and feasible training method to increase function and strength in individuals with chronic stroke.
B	Externalising behavior problems involve a huge developmental risk potential as they can substantially interface with the parallel process of establishing and forming identity in peer groups during adolescence while simultaneously coping with expectations regarding academic achievement and behaviour.
B	Therefore adolescents with externalising behavior constitute a potential target audience for health promotion.
B	Aim of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to clarify in what kind of social contexts externalising behavior problems are associated with decreased subjective health in adolescence.
M	An analysis of secondary data from the KiGGS study ( Robert Koch-Institute , 2009 ) was undertaken.
M	Calculations of logistic regression models for boys and girls were performed on the basis of preceding stratifications using the indicator subjective health and including relevant social demographic factors.
R	Externalising adolescents face a higher risk of decreased subjective health than inconspicuous adolescents of the same age group , while there is a gender-specific difference ( boys OR 2.76 ; girls OR 1.48 ).
R	The gender-specific differences in subjective health appraisal found in inconspicuous adolescents cannot be verified in adolescents with externalising behaviour.
R	Related to social demographic predictors a classic social gradient for girls is verified whereas externalising behaviour in boys is predominantly associated from high social class and decreased subjective health.
R	In multivariate procedures a higher odds ratio for decreased subjective health becomes apparent for adolescents who ascend or descend in relation to their education level as well as for adolescents from higher social classes who had to repeat a school year.
C	Adolescents with externalising behavior frequently rate their health situation as being bad.
C	The fact that it is primarily boys with behavior problems and boys who are inter-generational mobile educationwise who exhibit decreased psychosocial well-being , indicates that an increased context related exclusion risk ( ostracism ) is an essential health risk factor.
C	Micro-groups of adolescents facing risk of being ostracised appear to be an essential target group for prevention and health promotion which so far is not being taken into consideration on the basis of school type related recommendations.
B	Childhood obesity is a global issue.
B	Understanding associated factors is essential in designing interventions to reduce its prevalence.
B	There are knowledge gaps concerning the leptogenic potential of play areas for very young children and particularly whether there is an association between levels of childhood obesity and play area quality.
M	A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to investigate whether spatial access to play areas had an association with healthy weight status of 4-5-year-old children.
M	Data from the English National Childhood Measurement Programme 2012/13 was used to measure healthy weight status and a geographic information system was used to calculate ( a ) the number of purposefully constructed play areas within 1 km ( density ) , and ( b ) the distance to nearest play area ( proximity ) , from child's residential postcode.
M	A play area quality score was included in predictive models.
M	Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for the clustering of observations by school.
M	Adjustment was also made for the effects of gender and deprivation.
R	77% of children had a healthy weight status ( >= 2nd and < 85th centile ).
R	In a fully adjusted multilevel model there was no statistically significant association between healthy weight status and density or proximity measures , with or without inclusion of a play area quality score , or when accounting for the effects of gender and deprivation.
C	Among 4-5-year-old children attending school , there was no association between healthy weight status and spatial access to play areas.
C	Reasons may include under-utilisation of play areas by reception age children , their minimal leptogenic influence or non-spatial influences affecting play area choice.
B	A fundamental aspect of self-consciousness is body ownership , which refers to the experience that our body and its parts belong to us and it is distinct from those of other persons.
B	Body ownership depends on the integration of different sensory stimulations and it is crucial for the development of functional motor and social abilities , which are compromised in individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ).
B	Here we examined the multisensory nature of body ownership in individuals with ASD by using a procedure based on tactile conflicts , namely the numbness illusion ( NI ).
M	We induced an illusory feeling of numbness and ownership for another person's finger by asking participants to hold their palm against another person's palm and to stroke the two joined index fingers with the index and thumb of their other hand.
R	As expected , when the agent self-strokes their finger , healthy participants do not perceive the NI if the stroking is performed asynchronously.
R	Conversely , in individuals with ASD the illusion occurred with both synchronous and asynchronous self-stroking.
C	We contend that individuals with ASD are more vulnerable than controls to this illusory tactile experience and we discuss the findings in light of impaired perception of the temporal relationships between tactile and proprioceptive inputs.
B	Long-acting reversible contraceptives , such as the intrauterine device ( IUD ) , remain underutilised in Pakistan with high discontinuation rates.
B	Based on a 24-month prospective client follow-up ( nested within a larger quasi-experimental study ) , this paper presents the comparison of two intervention models , one using private mid-level providers branded as "Suraj" and the other using community midwives ( CMWs ) of Maternal Newborn and Child Health Programme , for method continuation among IUD users.
B	Moreover , determinants of IUD continuation and the reasons for discontinuation , and switching behaviour were studied within each arm.
M	A total of 1 ,163 IUD users , 824 from Suraj and 339 from the CMW model , were enrolled in this 24-month prospective client follow-up.
M	Participants were followed-up by female community mobilisers physically every second month to ascertain continued IUD usage and to collect information on associated factors , switching behaviour , reasons for discontinuation , and pregnancy occurrence.
M	The probabilities of IUD continuation and the risk factors for discontinuation were estimated by life table analysis and Cox proportional-hazard techniques , respectively.
R	The cumulative probabilities of IUD continuation at 24 months in Suraj and CMW models were 82% and 80% , respectively.
R	The difference between the two intervention areas was not significant.
R	The probability distributions of IUD continuation were also similar in both interventions ( Log rank test: chi( 2 ) = 0.06 , df = 1 , P = 0.81 ; Breslow test: chi( 2 ) = 0.6 , df = 1 , P = 0.44 ).
R	Health concerns ( Suraj = 57.1% , CMW= 38.7% ) and pregnancy desire ( Suraj = 29.3% , CMW= 40.3% ) were reported as the most prominent reasons for IUD discontinuation in both intervention arms.
R	IUD discontinuation was significantly associated with place of residence in Suraj and with age ( 15-25 years ) in the CMW model.
C	CMWs and private providers are equally capable of providing quality IUD services and ensuring higher method continuation.
C	Pakistan's National Maternal Newborn and Child Health programme should consider training CMWs and providing IUDs through them.
C	Moreover , private sector mid-level providers could be engaged in promoting the use of IUDs.
B	The expansion of trust law to the German statutory health insurance ( SHI ) and the declining numbers of sickness funds suggest a strong concentration process in the German SHI market.
B	The paper examines the level and development of market concentration since the introduction of the free choice of sickness funds in 1996.
M	The study is based on a dataset containing information on membership , contribution rate , openness , area of activity and legal successor for all sickness funds in the period from 1996 to 2013.
M	Market concentration is measured by the concentration rate ( cumulative market share of the largest market participants ) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index ( HHI ).
M	In addition , the change in the HHI is also disaggregated into 3 factors: opening , switching and fusion of sickness funds.
R	Concentration rate and HHI decreased significantly between 1996 and 2008 due to opening of former closed sickness funds and a switching behaviour from large to small funds.
R	The SHI Competition Enhancement Act of 2007 led to a turnaround.
R	The reform permitted cross-type mergers and introduced a completely new system of budget allocation with the central health fund.
R	The latter put an end to the growing membership of small funds due to adverse selection processes.
R	As a result , market concentration in the German SHI rises.
R	Although recent mega-mergers were uncritical for nationwide competition , the study already indicates the risk of market dominance on the regional level.
B	As part of an ongoing Scandinavian project on the dignity of care for older people , this study is based on 'clinical caring science' as a scientific discipline.
B	Clinical caring science examines how ground concepts , axioms and theories are expressed in different clinical contexts.
B	Central notions are caring culture , dignity , at-home-ness , the little extra , non-caring cultures versus caring cultures and ethical context - and climate.
P	This study investigates the individual variations of caring cultures in relation to dignity and how it is expressed in caring acts and ethical contexts.
P	Three assumptions are formulated: ( 1 ) the caring culture of nursing homes influences whether dignified care is provided , ( 2 ) an ethos that is reflected on and appropriated by the caregiver mirrors itself in ethical caring acts and as artful caring in an ethical context and ( 3 ) caring culture is assumed to be a more ontological or universal concept than , for example , an ethical context or ethical person-to-person acts.
M	The methodological approach is hermeneutic.
M	The data consist of 28 interviews with relatives of older persons from Norway , Denmark and Sweden.
M	The principles of voluntariness , confidentiality and anonymity were respected during the whole research process.
R	Three patterns were revealed: dignity as at-home-ness , dignity as the little extra and non-dignifying ethical context.
C	Caring communion , invitation , at-home-ness and 'the little extra' are expressions of ethical contexts and caring acts in a caring culture.
C	A non-caring culture may not consider the dignity of its residents and may be represented by routinized care that values organizational efficiency and instrumentalism rather than an individual's dignity and self-worth.
C	An ethos must be integrated in both the organization and in the individual caregiver in order to be expressed in caring acts and in an ethical context that supports these caring acts.
B	The transition to adulthood , the gradual change in roles and responsibilities , is identified as a challenging time for adolescents and young adults with physical disabilities , including those with cerebral palsy.
B	Health care , education , employment , independent living , and community engagement have been identified as areas of concern.
B	However , relatively little research has been done to understand the experiences , perceptions , and needs of individuals with cerebral palsy as they transition toward adulthood.
P	The objective of this study was to explore the transition experiences , perceptions , and needs of young adults with cerebral palsy living in one state in the southeastern United States.
M	Focus groups with nine young adults with cerebral palsy ( 19-34 years ) were conducted.
M	The focus group interview explored the preparation for transition and experiences navigating adulthood.
M	The audio-recorded groups were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.
R	Young adults with cerebral palsy identified numerous challenges associated with navigating adulthood.
R	The main themes were: 1 ) being thrust into adulthood ; 2 ) navigating systems and services ; 3 ) understanding and managing my body ; and 4 ) dealing with stereotypes and prejudice.
C	The findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to transition with a focus on building capacity and empowerment.
C	To navigate complex systems of care , "navigators" or "facilitators" are needed.
C	Additionally , practitioners and service providers in adult systems need further education about cerebral palsy.

P	This study was done to compare factors influencing children's self-esteem between two parent families and single parent families.
M	The participants were 692 children aged 11 to 13 yr ( 388 in two parent families and 304 in single parent families ) recruited from 20 community agencies and 5 elementary schools in Gyeonggi Province and Seoul City , South Korea.
M	Data were collected from May to July , 2007 using a survey questionnaire containing items on self-esteem , internal control , problematic behavior , school record , family hardiness , parent-child communication and social support.
M	The data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 program and factors affecting children's self-esteem were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression.
R	Scores for the study variables were significantly different between the two groups.
R	The factors influencing children's self-esteem were also different according to family type.
R	For two parent families , internal control , problematic behavior , school record , and parent-child communication significantly predicted the level of self-esteem ( adjusted R( 2 )=.505 , p<.001 ).
R	For single parent families , social support , family hardiness , internal control , problematic behavior , school record , and parent-child communication significantly predicted the level of self-esteem ( adjusted R( 2 )=.444 , p<.001 ).
C	Nurse working with children should consider family type-specific factors influencing their self-esteem.
P	To advance a framework of indicators that promotes implementation of math standards under the Every Student Succeeds Act ( ESSA ) , we tested a conceptual model of the resources and processes within schools that influence the opportunity to learn mathematics ( OTL ) in the classroom using a recent administration of the 2011 Trends in International Math and Science Study ( TIMSS 2011 ).
P	There is potential benefit to state departments and system-level practitioners from more information about how schools might influence student access to college and career-ready curriculum.
P	Such information has the potential to shape the kinds of indicators stakeholders put in place to target problems and formulate solutions for math learning.
M	To test the fit of our hypothesized model of math content and instruction OTL , we applied structural equation modeling techniques to school and classroom data from 425 fourth-grade U.S. math teachers in TIMSS 2011.
R	We found a direct influence of instructional leadership on OTL math instruction in the classroom and teacher participation in math professional development.
R	Content-specific resources indirectly influenced both OTL math instruction and content through teacher preparedness.
C	The results of this study demonstrate a potential framework through which school leaders can support the preparedness of teachers in providing students with equitable access to coherent , focused , and rigorous math content.
B	A good deal of research has been written about the problems and challenges facing Black male youth in their educational endeavors , ranging from academic performances , aspirations , and outcomes to student-teacher relationships , social experiences , and identity development.
B	Statements calling for more Black male teachers abound in current educational discourse , and a number of studies have focused on their experiences in teaching , their pedagogical practices , and their role within the school setting.
B	However , little attention has been given to how Black male students experience their learning and relationships with Black male teachers-the very people who are supposed to benefit from this adult presence.
B	The present study investigates Black male students' experiences with Black male teachers at a single-sex urban secondary school.
P	The purpose of this study was to understand Black male students' experiences in an all-male learning environment , with a particular emphasis on the role of Black male adults in their schooling experiences.
M	This study focused on the schooling experiences of 20 college-age Black males who all attended the same single-sex public high school.
M	Qualitative research methods were used in this study.
M	In particular , data from in-depth interviews explored students' narratives about how they experienced and made meaning from the all-male schooling environment.
R	Findings suggest that the students conceptualized adult Black males at their school as otherfathers based on their pedagogical practices , care and concern , and support.
R	First , students expressed their need or desire for male teachers in their secondary schooling experiences.
R	Students identified Black male adults as significant contributors to their development.
R	Second , learning from Black male teachers was valued highly by students because these experiences provided them with insider perspectives and key insights on being Black and male.
R	Students were exposed to opportunities to learn about how race and gender could matter in their lives.
R	Finally , engaging with Black male adults in their schooling experiences provided students with unique opportunities to learn more about themselves.
R	Students' learning enhanced their critical consciousness and connected to their racial and gender identities as well.
R	Students attributed much of their success and personal development to how Black male teachers engaged in otherfathering-expressed as holistic care , support , parenting , modeling , and life coaching.
C	Implications and recommendations for educational researchers and practitioners to better understand how Black males matter in the lives and schooling experiences of Black male youth are discussed.
B	Type 2 diabetes is a significant public health problem , with U.S. Pacific Islander communities bearing a disproportionate burden.
B	The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander community that has significant inequities in diabetes , yet few evidence-based diabetes interventions have been developed to address this inequity.
P	We used a community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach to adapt an evidence-based diabetes self-management education ( DSME ) intervention for the Marshallese.
M	Our team used the Cultural Adaptation Process Model , in addition to an iterative process consisting of formative data and previous literature review , and engagement with community and academic experts.
M	Lessons Learned: Specific cultural considerations were identified in adapting DSME components , including the dichotomous versus gradient conceptualization of ideas , the importance of engaging the entire family , the use of nature analogies , and the role of spirituality.
C	We identified key cultural considerations to incorporate into a diabetes self-management program for the Marshallese.
C	The insights gained can inform others' work with Pacific Islanders.
B	Studying de-implementation-defined herein as reducing or stopping the use of a health service or practice provided to patients by healthcare practitioners and systems-has gained traction in recent years.
B	De-implementing ineffective , unproven , harmful , overused , inappropriate , and/or low-value health services and practices is important for mitigating patient harm , improving processes of care , and reducing healthcare costs.
B	A better understanding of the state-of-the-science is needed to guide future objectives and funding initiatives.
B	To this end , we characterized de-implementation research grants funded by the United States ( US ) National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ).
M	We used systematic methods to search , identify , and describe de-implementation research grants funded across all 27 NIH Institutes and Centers ( ICs ) and AHRQ from fiscal year 2000 through 2017.
M	Eleven key terms and three funding opportunity announcements were used to search for research grants in the NIH Query , View and Report ( QVR ) system.
M	Two coders identified eligible grants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.
M	A codebook was developed , pilot tested , and revised before coding the full grant applications of the final sample.
R	A total of 1277 grants were identified through the QVR system ; 542 remained after removing duplicates.
R	After the multistep eligibility assessment and review process , 20 grant applications were coded.
R	Many grants were funded by NIH ( n = 15 ) , with fewer funded by AHRQ , and a majority were funded between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ( n = 11 ).
R	Grant proposals focused on de-implementing a range of health services and practices ( e.g. , medications , therapies , screening tests ) across various health areas ( e.g. , cancer , cardiovascular disease ) and delivery settings ( e.g. , hospitals , nursing homes , schools ).
R	Grants proposed to use a variety of study designs and research methods ( e.g. , experimental , observational , mixed methods ) to accomplish study aims.
C	Based on the systematic portfolio analysis of NIH-and AHRQ-funded research grants over the past 17 years , relatively few have focused on studying the de-implementation of ineffective , unproven , harmful , overused , inappropriate , and/or low-value health services and practices provided to patients by healthcare practitioners and systems.
C	Strategies for raising the profile and growing the field of research on de-implementation are discussed.
B	Although numerous investigations have indicated that social participation ( SP ) has positive effects on the health of older adults , there have been few studies on its negative health consequences.
B	We examined the cross-sectional associations of the type , frequency , and autonomy for SP with physical and mental health.
M	The analytical subjects were 5126 males and 7006 females who were functionally independent , born between 1945 and 1949 , and covered by A City's medical insurance system.
M	Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-8 Health Survey.
M	SP was measured through six types of social groups.
M	These social groups included volunteer groups , sports groups , hobby clubs , senior citizens' clubs , neighborhood community associations , and cultural groups.
M	Analysis of covariance was conducted to compare adjusted physical health component summary scores ( PCS ) and mental health component summary scores ( MCS ) by the frequency and autonomy of SP.
M	Age , family size , body mass index , chronic conditions , smoking , alcohol intake , depression and cognitive functioning were included as covariates.
M	To examine whether the associations between SP and PCS/MCS are different between genders , we performed analyses stratified by gender.
R	Overall , positive associations of the frequency and autonomy of SP with PCS and MCS were stronger in females than males.
R	As to frequency , frequent participation in sports groups and hobby clubs had significantly better PCS among both genders and better MCS among females than non-participation.
R	None of the groups differed significantly in the MCS among males.
R	As to autonomy , among both genders , voluntary participation in sports groups and hobby clubs had significantly better PCS than non-participation , and better MCS than not only non-participation , but also obligatory participation.
R	Among females , obligatory participation in all groups had significantly poorer MCS than voluntary participation , and obligatory participation in sports groups had significantly poorer MCS than non-participation.
C	Obligatory SP had significantly poorer MCS than voluntary participation , occasionally than non-participation ; there is a possibility that obligatory SP has harmful influences on mental health of community-dwelling elderly.
C	Measures to promote SP with consideration for individuals' autonomy may be effective in the public health approach to maintaining mental health.
B	Evidence suggests that sleep-related respiratory and related metabolic compromise may vary between females and males with sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ).
B	Our purpose was to elucidate possible gender differences in sleep-associated respiratory and inflammatory parameters in patients with SDB.
M	A consecutive number of SDB patients ( 46 females and 167 males ) who underwent polysomnography were retrospectively reviewed.
M	Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentration , apnea index ( ApnI ) , hypopnea index ( HypI ) , apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , average and minimal SpO( 2 ) , duration of snoring , age , and body mass index ( BMI ) were compared between sexes.
M	Spearman's correlation coefficients between parameters were also calculated.
R	ApnI and AHI were significantly higher in males.
R	Correlation analysis revealed striking gender differences: only in females , CRP concentration was highly correlated with snoring duration ( r=0.4393 ) , BMI ( r=0.7147 ) , minimal SpO( 2 ) ( r=-0.4357 ) , and average SpO( 2 ) ( r=-0.4547 ) ; in females , HypI was more strongly correlated with AHI ( r=0.8778 ) , average SpO( 2 ) ( r=-0.5765 ) , minimal SpO( 2 ) ( r=-0.5817 ) , and fibrinogen concentration ( r=0.4614 ) than in males ( r=0.4373 ; -0.3295 ; -0.2969 ; and 0.0887 , respectively ) ; in females , age had a much more pronounced effect on ApnI , HypI , AHI , average oxygen saturation ( SaO( 2 ) ) , minimal SaO( 2 ) , snoring duration , and CRP and fibrinogen concentration.
C	Respiratory compromise in females with SDB is more strongly associated with systemic inflammation than in males with SDB.
C	Although females display a pathological AHI less frequently than males , they reach quite similar pathological SaO( 2 ) , CRP , and fibrinogen values.
C	Therefore , AHI may underestimate the pathophysiological systemic effects of SDB in females.
P	To examine the effects of various medical conditions and medications on subsequent motor vehicle injuries ( MVIs ).
M	The National Population Health Survey , a large , nationally representative , longitudinal study of Canadians , included self-reported medical conditions of asthma , arthritis/rheumatism , back problems excluding arthritis , high blood pressure , migraine headaches , diabetes , heart disease and distress , and medication use during the past month for asthma , high blood pressure , diabetes , heart , codeine/pethidine ( Demerol )/morphine , other pain relievers , antidepressants , tranquilizers , and sleeping medication.
M	Path analyses were used to examine the odds of subsequent MVI for different medical conditions and medication use reported prior to the MVI ( in the previous wave of the survey ) while controlling for age and sex.
R	Increased odds of subsequent MVIs were found for asthma ( odds ratio [OR]: 1.864 , 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.281 , 2.713 ) , arthritis/rheumatism ( OR: 1.659 , 95% CI: 1.163 , 2.365 ) , back problems ( OR: 2.169 , 95% CI: 1.624 , 2.895 ) , and migraines ( OR: 1.631 , 95% CI: 1.125 , 2.364 ) but not for high blood pressure ( OR: 1.435 , 95% CI: 0.944 , 2.181 ) , diabetes ( OR: 1.479 , 95% CI: 0.743 , 2.944 ) , heart disease ( OR: 2.627 , 95% CI: 0.941 , 7.334 ) or distress ( OR: 1.153 , 95% CI: 0.840 , 1.581 ).
R	Except for migraine with codeine/pethidine/morphine , this effect persisted regardless of whether medication was used to treat the condition.
R	Respondents who reported using certain medications , namely , codeine/pethidine/morphine ( OR: 2.215 , 95% CI: 1.274 , 3.850 ) , other pain medication ( OR: 1.630 , 95% CI: 1.242 , 2.139 ) , antidepressants ( OR: 2.664.
R	95% CI: 1.602 , 4.429 ) , and sleeping medication ( OR: 2.059 , 95% CI: 1.161 , 3.651 ) , had increased odds of subsequent MVI , independent of related medical condition , whereas tranquillizers showed no increased odds of subsequent MVIs.
C	This study suggests that the relationship between medical conditions , medications , and MVIs is complex but consistent with other studies.
P	Harsh , abusive , and rejecting behavior by parents toward their children is associated with increased risk for many developmental problems for youth.
P	Earlier research also shows that children raised by harsh parents are more likely to treat their own children harshly.
P	The present study evaluated nurturing and supportive behaviors of spouses or cohabiting romantic partners hypothesized to strengthen co-parent relationships and help break this intergenerational cycle of harsh parenting.
M	Data come from the Family Transitions Project , a 22-year , 3-generation study of a cohort of over 500 early adolescents ( G2 ) grown to adulthood.
M	During adolescence , observers rated G1 ( parent of G2 ) harsh parenting to G2.
M	Several years later , observers rated G2 harsh parenting toward their oldest child ( G3 ).
M	In addition , G2's romantic partner ( spouse or cohabiting partner ) was rated by observers on a range of behaviors expected to affect G2 harsh parenting.
R	Romantic partner warmth and positive communication with G2 were associated with less G2 harsh parenting toward G3 ( a compensatory or main effect ) and when these partner behaviors were high , there was no evidence of intergenerational continuity from G1 to G2 harsh parenting ( a moderating or protective effect ).
R	G1 harsh parenting slightly decreased the likelihood that G2 would select a supportive spouse or romantic partner ( evidence of cumulative continuity ).
C	Romantic partner warmth and positive communication appear to disrupt continuity in harsh and abusive parenting.
C	As appropriate , preventive interventions designed to reduce risk for child maltreatment should include a focus on spousal or partner behaviors in their educational or treatment programs.

B	Recent evidence suggests intolerance of uncertainty ( IU ) is a transdiagnostic variable elevated across anxiety disorders.
B	No studies have investigated IU's response to transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety ( TGCBT ).
B	This study evaluated IU outcomes following TGCBT across anxiety disorders.
M	151 treatment-seekers with primary diagnoses of social anxiety disorder , panic disorder , or GAD were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of TGCBT and completed self-report questionnaires at pre- , mid- , and post-treatment.
R	IU decreased significantly following treatment.
R	Decreases in IU predicted improvements in clinical presentation across diagnoses.
R	IU interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation irrespective of primary diagnosis.
R	IU also interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation although interactions of time with diagnosis-specific measures did not.
R	IUS interacted with time to predict reduction in anxiety and fear symptoms , and inhibitory IU interacted with time to predicted reductions in anxiety symptoms but prospective IU did not.
C	IU appears to be an important transdiagnostic variable in CBT implicated in both initial presentation and treatment change.
C	Further implications are discussed Published by Elsevier Ltd.
P	This study investigated the effects of a family literacy program on Latino parents' language practices at home and their children's oral language skills.
P	The study examined the extent to which ( a ) the program called Family Reading Intervention for Language and Literacy in Spanish was effective at teaching low-income , low-education Latino parents 3 language strategies ( i.e. , comments , high-level questions , and recasts ) for reading aloud and ( b ) parent implementation of the target strategies influenced children's language skills.
M	Five Latino mothers and their Spanish-speaking preschool children participated in a multiple-baseline , single-subject design across participants.
M	Program initiation was staggered across the mothers after obtaining a stable baseline.
M	Data on parent and child outcomes were collected across 3 experimental conditions: baseline , intervention , and follow-up.
M	This study employed visual data analysis ( e.g. , level , trend , variability ) to examine the program effects on parent and child outcomes.
R	The program had an important effect on parental use of comments and high-level questions , but less impact on recasts.
R	In addition , the program had a notable effect on the children's use of different words and conversational turns , less effect on inferences , and no effect on the mean length of utterance in words.
C	Family Reading Intervention for Language and Literacy in Spanish is an effective program to extend and enrich the reading practices that low-income children from a culturally and linguistically diverse background experience at home.
C	The results have implications for family literacy programs aimed at minority Spanish-speaking families.
B	Hospital acquired pressure ulcers have a detrimental effect on patient quality of life , morbidity , mortality , and cost to the healthcare industry.
B	Little is known about pressure ulcer prevention in perioperative services.
P	The objectives of this study were to describe perioperative registered nurses ( RNs ) knowledge , attitudes , behaviors , and barriers about pressure ulcer prevention and to determine if knowledge and the availability of a pressure ulcer staging tool are predictors of pressure ulcer prevention behavior.
M	A cross-sectional descriptive pilot study was conducted.
M	Sixty-two perioperative RNs from 10 acute care hospitals participated.
R	Perioperative nurses believed carrying out pressure ulcer prevention strategies is essential to nursing practice but only two-thirds reported conducting pressure ulcer risk assessment on all patients and daily assessment on at risk patients.
R	Results indicated a knowledge deficit regarding assessment and prevention of pressure ulcers as performance on the PUKT ( 72% ) fell below the recommended score of 90%.
R	Results of binary logistic regression indicated that knowledge as measured by the PUKT and availability of a pressure ulcer staging tool were statistically significant ( p = 0.03 ) predictors of pressure ulcer prevention behavior.
R	The initial model without the predictor variables , indicated an overall success rate of correct predictions of 64% which increase to 73% when the predictor variables were added to the initial model.
C	Although perioperative nurses believe that pressure ulcer prevention is important , a knowledge deficit exists and there is a need for pressure ulcer prevention education.

B	A growing literature on adults with substance use disorders ( SUDs ) suggests that religious and spiritual processes can support recovery , such that higher levels of religiosity and/or spirituality predict better substance use outcomes.
B	However , studies of the role of religion and spirituality in adolescent SUD treatment response have produced mixed findings , and religiosity and spirituality have rarely been examined separately.
M	The present study examined religiosity and spirituality as predictors of outcomes in an outpatient treatment adolescent sample ( N=101 ) in which cannabis was the predominant drug of choice.
M	Qualitative data were used to contextualize the quantitative findings.
R	Results showed that higher levels of spirituality at posttreatment predicted increased cannabis use at 6-month follow-up ( =.237 , p=.043 ) , whereas higher levels of baseline spirituality predicted a lower likelihood of heavy drinking at posttreatment ( odds ratio [OR]=.316 , P=.040 ).
R	Religiosity did not predict substance use outcomes at later time points.
R	When asked to describe the relation between their religious/spiritual views and their substance use , adolescents described believing that they had a choice about their substance use and were in control of it , feeling more spiritual when under the influence of cannabis , and being helped by substance use.
C	Together , findings suggest that for adolescents with SUDs , religion and spirituality may not counteract the use of cannabis , which may be explained by adolescents' views of their substance use as being consistent with their spirituality and under their control.
B	The interest in the children's role in pediatric care is connected to children's health-related autonomy and informed consent in care.
B	Despite the strong history of children's rights , nurses' role in the everyday nursing phenomenon , that is , restraint in somatic pediatric care , is still relatively seldom reported.
P	The aim of this study is to describe nurses' perceptions of the use of restraint in somatic pediatric care.
P	The ultimate aim is to deepen the understanding of the phenomenon of restraint , whose previous study has been fragmented.
M	Qualitative approach was selected because of the lack of previous information.
M	Due to the sensitivity of the research question , individual interviewees were selected among voluntary nurses ( n = 8 ).
M	All participants were registered nurses with general work experience as nurses of 5-16 years on average and specifically 1.5-10 years in pediatric nursing.
M	Inductive content analysis was used for aiming to produce a synthesis of the research phenomenon.
M	The research received organizational approval by the university hospital , and informed consent and confidentiality were ensured.
R	Restraint in pediatric nursing was process-like , but occurred without advanced planning.
R	The restraint-related process included five categories: ( a ) identification of the situations where restraint may occur , ( b ) finding preventive methods , ( c ) identification of different forms of restraint , ( d ) rationing the use of restraint , and ( e ) post-restraint acts.
R	Restraint was seen as a part of pediatric nursing which occurred daily and involved several professionals.
R	According to the nurses' illustrations , restraint means doing things even when a child is not agreeable.
C	Restraint is part of somatic pediatric nursing , described as the last , but in some cases , the only resort for carrying out care or treatment.
C	Restraint is not a goal in itself , but an instrumental tool and procedure in carrying out care.
C	In the future , more information about nurses' role and the use of restraint in pediatric nursing is still needed.
B	Academic probation is a nearly universal but underresearched policy practiced at most postsecondary institutions.
P	To evaluate the impact of probation warning letters on students' academic performance.
M	Employing the inferentially strong regression discontinuity design , we evaluated the impact of two versions of warning letters ( U.S. mail and email ) , noting their impact on next semester grades.
M	Probation and nonprobation students at a large , Midwestern college enrolled during two , successive fall-winter semester pairs ( n > 17 ,000 , for each pair ).
M	Fall and winter grade point averages ( GPAs ) were identified for each individual student in the study sample.
R	Using both parametric and nonparametric analyses , we found that neither delivery method , paper or electronic , had a consistent , significant impact on subsequent GPA or odds of a GPA 2.0 during the next semester.
R	Four of the eight measures of effect for GPA were small and positive ( 0.02-0.15 ; one significant positive outcome ) , and four were negative ( -0.02 to -0.08 ; one significant negative result ).
R	A separate set of analyses that excluded students who took a single course led to further inconsistency in results.
R	Supplementary analyses that excluded students scoring far from the cut-point yielded results consistent with a no-difference conclusion.
R	Our findings also indicated that , after being placed on probation , only a small percentage of students were able to avoid movement to the next stage of academic sanction.
C	Warning letters notifying students of probation status , lacking a staff-focused intervention , had little impact on academic performance.
B	Poverty is multi dimensional.
B	Beyond the quantitative and tangible issues related to inadequate income it also has equally important social , more intangible and difficult if not impossible to quantify dimensions.
B	In 2009 , we explored these social and relativist dimension of poverty in five communities in the South of Ghana with differing socio economic characteristics to inform the development and implementation of policies and programs to identify and target the poor for premium exemptions under Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme.
M	We employed participatory wealth ranking ( PWR ) a qualitative tool for the exploration of community concepts , identification and ranking of households into socioeconomic groups.
M	Key informants within the community ranked households into wealth categories after discussing in detail concepts and indicators of poverty.
R	Community defined indicators of poverty covered themes related to type of employment , educational attainment of children , food availability , physical appearance , housing conditions , asset ownership , health seeking behavior , social exclusion and marginalization.
R	The poverty indicators discussed shared commonalities but contrasted in the patterns of ranking per community.
C	The in-depth nature of the PWR process precludes it from being used for identification of the poor on a large national scale in a program such as the NHIS.
C	However , PWR can provide valuable qualitative input to enrich discussions , development and implementation of policies , programs and tools for large scale interventions and targeting of the poor for social welfare programs such as premium exemption for health care.
B	Adverse drug event ( ADE ) reporting by pharmacists is an indispensable part of the drug safety system.
B	U.S. pharmacists may submit reports of serious ADEs that they encounter to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) through Med Watch.
B	However , underreporting of serious ADEs is a common problem.
B	Little is known about pharmacists' decision making with respect to ADE reporting.
P	This study explored the utility of the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) model in predicting Texas pharmacists' intention to report serious ADEs to the FDA.
M	Data were collected from practicing Texas pharmacists using a mail questionnaire.
M	A total of 1500 surveys were mailed , and 377 usable responses were obtained for a response rate of 26.4%.
R	A majority ( 70.2% ) of the 377 respondents were white/Caucasian , and 52.9% were male.
R	Overall , pharmacists intended to report serious ADEs ( mean = 15.87 +/- 4.22 ; possible range: 3-21 ) , had a positive attitude toward reporting ( mean = 4.62 +/- 4.92 ; possible range: -15 to +15 ) , perceived that important others wanted them to report ( subjective norm [SN] score = 5.65 +/- 2.99 ; possible range: -9 to +9 ) , and believed that they had control over their reporting behavior ( perceived behavioral control [PBC] score = 3.54 +/- 2.69 ; possible/actual range: -6 to +6 ).
R	Attitude ( beta = 0.221 , P < .001 ) and SN ( beta = 0.438 , P < .001 ) significantly predicted intent ; however , PBC ( beta = 0.028 , P > .05 ) did not.
R	Attitude , SN , and PBC together accounted for 34.0% of the variance in intention to report serious ADEs ( P < .001 ).
R	The addition of past reporting behavior ( P = .021 ) and perceived moral obligation ( P < .001 ) significantly increased the variance in intention explained by the TPB model.
C	Pharmacists showed a strong positive intent to report serious ADEs to the FDA.
C	Strategies to increase pharmacists' intentions to report serious ADEs should focus on helping them see the value of reporting and altering their perception of social pressure toward reporting.
C	The TPB may have utility in predicting ADE-reporting behavior.

B	The extracellular-regulated protein kinase ( ERK ) pathway has been implicated in processes such as neuronal plasticity and resilience in psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder ( MOD ) , bipolar disorder ( BPD ) , and schizophrenia.
B	The extent of the possible involvement of this pathway in psychiatric disorders remains unknown , as does its potential utility as a pharmacological target for the future development of novel therapeutics.
M	Western blot analyses were used to measure levels of different proteins-LRap1 , B-Raf , MEK1 , MEK2 , ERK1/2 , RSK1 , CREB , NSE , and beta-actin in the postmortem frontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia , MDD , and BPD , as well as healthy non-psychiatric controls.
R	Levels of most studied protein members of the ERK cascade were lower in individuals with psychiatric disorders than controls ; differences between psychiatric groups were not statistically significant.
R	In general , protein levels were lower in individuals with schizophrenia than in those with BPD or MDD , but protein levels varied across groups.
C	The small number of individuals in each diagnostic group may limit our interpretation of the results.
C	Factors such as postmortem interval , medication status at time of death , and mood state at time of death may also have influenced the findings.
C	The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ERK pathway is implicated in reduced neuronal plasticity associated with the course of these psychiatric illnesses.
C	The results warrant an expanded investigation into the activity of other members of this pathway as well as other brain areas of interest.

B	Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) has become a major public health problem in China.
B	Although a number of researchers have investigated DM risk factors , little is known about the associations between values of fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) and influencing factors.
B	This study aims to explore these associations by the quantile regression ( QR ) model.
M	A cross-sectional survey based on a sample of 23 ,050 adults aged 18 to 79 years was conducted in Jilin in 2012 , and some subjects were excluded due to missing values with respect to necessary variables or having glycemic control , in accordance with the purposes of this study.
M	Finally , in total 14 ,698 people were included in this study.
M	QR was performed to identify the factors influencing the level of FBG in different quantiles of FBG.
R	The distribution of FBG status was different between males and females ( ( 2 ) = 175.30 , p < 0.001 ).
R	The QR model provided more detailed views on the associations of FBG with different factors and revealed apparent quantile-related patterns separately for different factors.
R	Body mass index ( BMI ) was positively associated with the low and middle quantiles of FBG.
R	Waist circumference ( WC ) had a positive association with the high quantiles of FBG.
C	FBG had a positive association with BMI in normal FBG , and a positive association with WC in high FBG.
C	Diet and alcohol intake were associated with FBG in normal FBG.
C	FBG was more likely to be elevated in the elderly , female workers , and people with family history of DM.
B	Cannabis remains the most commonly used illicit substance and use rates are rising.
B	Notably , the prevalence of cannabis use disorders ( CUD ) nearly equals that of other illicit substance use disorders combined.
B	Thus , the present study aimed to identify cognitive , affective , and situational predictors and consequences of ad-lib cannabis use in a racially diverse sample.
M	The sample consisted of 93 current cannabis users ( 34.4% female ; 57.1% non-Hispanic Caucasian ) , 87.1% of whom evinced a current CUD.
M	Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to collect frequent ratings of cannabis withdrawal , craving , affect , cannabis use motives , and peer cannabis use over two weeks.
M	Mixed effects linear models examined within- and between-day correlates and consequences of cannabis use.
R	Withdrawal and craving were higher on cannabis use days than non-use days.
R	Withdrawal , craving , and positive and negative affect were higher immediately prior to cannabis use compared to non-use episodes.
R	Withdrawal and craving were higher among those who subsequently used cannabis than those who did not.
R	Cannabis use resulted in less subsequent withdrawal , craving , and negative affect.
R	Enhancement and coping motives were the most common reasons cited for use.
R	Withdrawal and negative affect were related to using cannabis for coping motives and social motives.
R	Participants were most likely to use cannabis if others were using , and withdrawal and craving were greater in social situations when others were using.
C	Data support the contention that cannabis withdrawal and craving and affect and peer use play important roles in the maintenance of cannabis use.

B	Despite the growing attention surrounding crack cocaine use in Brazil , little is understood about crack users' histories , use patterns and the interplay of drug-use behaviors , settings , and access/barriers to care.
B	Qualitative studies seldom cross-compare findings regarding people who use crack from different settings.
B	This study aims to explore the insights of regular crack users in two major Brazilian cities and to examine how social and contextual factors , including stigma and marginalization , influence initial use and a range of health and social issues.
M	In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with 38 adult crack cocaine users recruited from impoverished neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
M	Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.
M	Qualitative analysis was carried out , and content was organized and analyzed by recurrent themes relevant to study interests.
R	For study participants from both cities , frequent crack cocaine use plays a central role in daily life and leads to a range of physical , psychological , and social consequences.
R	Common concerns among users include excessive crack use , engagement in risky habits , infrequent health service utilization , marginalization , and difficulty reducing use.
C	Disadvantaged conditions in which many crack cocaine users grow up and live may perpetuate risk behaviors and stigma may further marginalize users from necessary health and recovery services.
C	Reducing stigma and moralizing discourse related to drug use , especially among health professionals and law enforcement personnel , may help encourage users to seek necessary care.
C	New harm-reduction-based care and treatment alternatives for marginalized drug users are being developed in parts of Brazil and elsewhere and should be adapted and expanded for other populations in need.
B	Health literacy ( HL ) is an important determinant for health and a valuable health indicator within public health.
B	As such , it is a significant outcome variable of health promotion efforts.
B	Valid and reliable instruments are needed to evaluate health promotion interventions and to assess levels of HL in a population.
B	One of the few measurements of communicative and critical HL is the Japanese Communicative and Critical Health Literacy scale ( C & C HL scale ).
B	To make it possible to use this instrument in Sweden , the C & C HL scale was translated into Swedish and different aspects of validity , including test-retest reliability , of the translated version were tested.
M	After translation and back-translation , The Swedish C & C HL scale was tested for content validity and test-retest reliability.
M	Data were collected from a committee consisting of public health experts and bilingual people , and from a test group of 35 persons.
R	The Swedish C & C HL scale was understandable and showed evidence of content validity.
R	The test-retest confirmed that it was stable over time , percentage agreements for the items ranging from 66% to 89% ( M = 74% ).
C	The Swedish C & C HL scale is equivalent to the Japanese C & C HL scale in terms of language and content.
C	The items cover the major aspects of communicative and critical HL and are understandable and stable over time , i.e. , reliable.
B	Peer influence on adolescent delinquency is well established , but little is known about moderators of peer influence.
B	In this study , we examined adolescents ( targets ) and their peers psychopathic personality traits as moderators of peer influence on delinquency in peer networks.
B	We used three separate dimensions of the psychopathic personality: grandiose-manipulative traits , callous-unemotional traits , and impulsive-irresponsible traits.
M	We used a peer network approach with five waves of longitudinal data from 847 adolescents in one community.
M	Peer nominations were not limited to the school context , thus allowing us to capture all potentially important peers.
M	In addition , peers reported on their own delinquency , thus allowing us to avoid problems of false consensus or projection that arise when individuals report on their peers delinquency.
M	We used simulation investigation for empirical network analyses ( SIENA ) , which is the only program currently available that can be used to study peer influence effects in peer networks of multiple relationships while controlling for selection effects.
R	Targets and peers callous-unemotional and grandiose-manipulative traits uniquely moderated peer influence on delinquency.
R	Relative to those with low levels , targets who were high on these traits were less influenced by peers delinquency , and peers who were high on these traits were more influential on targets delinquency.
R	Selection effects were found for impulsive-irresponsible traits , but these traits did not moderate peer influence on delinquency.
C	As the first study to look at moderating effects of psychopathic traits on peer influence , this study advances knowledge about peer influence on delinquency and about psychopathic traits in adolescents.
C	In addition , the study contributes to the literature by looking at unique effects of the three dimensions of psychopathy and taking a peer network approach , in which network effects , self-selection , and other selection effects are controlled when examining influence and moderators of influence.
B	Malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an acute disease which kills an estimated 863 ,000 people per year according to the WHO report of 2009.
B	The fight against malaria is faced with the occurrence of widespread resistance of P. falciparum.
B	The search for plant-derived antimalarial drugs has great importance in this regard.
B	Thus this study evaluates the toxicity and antimalarial activity of extracts of Clerodendrum myricoides , Dodonia angustifolia and Aloe debrana.
M	Acute and sub acute toxicity studies of the extracts were carried out by giving up to 3000mg/kg to noninfected mice.
M	Weight loss , change in general behavior and mortality were used as indicators of toxicity.
M	Doses of 200 , 400 & 600mg/kg/day of each extract of C. myricoides , D. dodonia and A. debrana were given orally to Plasmodium berghei infected mice following the four-day suppressive test procedure.
R	None of the extracts caused symptoms of toxicity at the given doses.
R	Each extract showed variable level of parasitaemia suppression in dose related manner.
R	Methanol extract of C. myricoides leaves exerted 82.50% suppression at the dose of 600mg/kg.
R	The methanol extract of the root of D. angustifolia showed the highest ( 84.52% ) suppression of parasitaemia at the dose of 600mg/kg.
R	Furthermore , methanol extract of A. debrana induced 73.95% suppression , whereas its water extract exerted 54.36% suppression of parasitaemia.
C	Crude extracts of C. myricoides , D. angustifolia and A. debrana caused strong activities against P. berghei indicating that they contain some chemical constituents that possibly lead to antimalarial drug development.

B	Successfully completing a drawing relies on the ability to accurately impose and manipulate spatial frames of reference for the object that is being drawn and for the drawing space.
B	Typically developing ( TD ) children use cues such as the page boundary as a frame of reference to guide the orientation of drawn lines.
B	Individuals with Williams syndrome ( WS ) typically produce incohesive drawings ; this is proposed to reflect a local processing bias.
P	Across two studies , we provide the first investigation of the effect of using a frame of reference when drawing simple lines and shapes in WS and TD groups ( matched for non-verbal ability ).
M	Individuals with WS ( N = 17 Experiment 1 ; N = 18 Experiment 2 ) and TD children matched by non-verbal ability drew single lines ( Experiment One ) and whole shapes ( Experiment Two ) within a neutral , incongruent or congruent frame.
M	The angular deviation of the drawn line/shape , relative to the model line/shape , was measured.
R	Both groups were sensitive to spatial frames of reference when drawing single lines and whole shapes , imposed by a frame around the drawing space.
C	A local processing bias in WS cannot explain poor drawing performance in WS.
B	By and large , in health professions training , the direction of the effect of e-learning , positive or negative , strongly depends on the learning outcome in question as well as on learning methods which e-learning is compared to.
B	hi nursing education , meta-analytically generated knowledge regarding the comparisons between conventional and e-learning is scarce.
P	The aim of this review is to discover the size of the effect of e-learning on learning outcomes in nursing education and to assess the quality of studies in which e-learning has been compared to conventional learning.
M	A systematic search of six electronic databases , PubMed , Ovid MEDLINE ( R ) , CINAHL ( EBSCOhost ) , Cochrane Library , PsycINFO , and ERIC , was conducted in order to identify relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published between 2011 and 2015.
M	The quality of the studies included as well as the risk of bias in each study was assessed.
M	A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to generate a pooled mean difference in the learning outcome.
R	Altogether , 10 studies were eligible for the quality assessment and meta-analysis.
R	Nine studies were evaluated as good quality studies , but not without a risk of bias.
R	Performance bias caused a high risk in nearly all the studies.
R	In the meta-analysis , an e-learning method resulted in test scores that were , on average , five points higher than a conventional method on a 0-100 scale.
R	Heterogeneity between the studies was very large.
C	The size and direction of the effect of a learning method on learning outcomes appeared to be strongly situational.
C	We suggest that meta-regressions should be performed instead of basic meta-analyses in order to reveal factors that cause variation in the learning outcomes of nursing education.
C	It might be necessary to perform separate meta-analyses between e-learning interventions aimed at improving nursing knowledge and those aimed at improving nursing skills.

P	We examined how providing artificially high or low statements about automation reliability affected expectations , perceptions , and use of automation over time.
B	One common method of introducing automation is providing explicit statements about the automation's capabilities.
B	Research is needed to understand how expectations from such introductions affect perceptions and use of automation.
M	Explicit-statement introductions were manipulated to set higher-than ( 90% ) , same-as ( 75% ) , or lower-than ( 60% ) levels of expectations in a dual-task scenario with 75% reliable automation.
M	Two experiments were conducted to assess expectations , perceptions , compliance , reliance , and task performance over ( a ) 2 days and ( b ) 4 days.
R	The baseline assessments showed initial expectations of automation reliability matched introduced levels of expectation.
R	For the duration of each experiment , the lower-than groups' perceptions were lower than the actual automation reliability.
R	However , the higher-than groups' perceptions were no different from actual automation reliability after Day 1 in either study.
R	There were few differences between groups for automation use , which generally stayed the same or increased with experience using the system.
C	Introductory statements describing artificially low automation reliability have a long-lasting impact on perceptions about automation performance.
C	Statements including incorrect automation reliability do not appear to affect use of automation.
C	Introductions should be designed according to desired outcomes for expectations , perceptions , and use of the automation.
C	Low expectations have long-lasting effects.
B	Suicide attempt in young age is associated with subsequent labour market marginalisation , but little is known about how marginalisation is affected by changes in suicide attempt rates and social insurance legislation and by age differences.
M	Prospective cohort study based on register linkage of >2.4 million Swedish residents per birth cohort , aged 19-40 years in 1999 ; 2004 and 2009 , respectively , and followed up for 4 years.
M	Suicide attempters treated in inpatient care in the three years preceding study entry ( n > 7000 per cohort ) were compared with the general population of the same age without attempt ( 1987 to end of follow-up ).
M	Hazard ratios ( HR ) and 95% confidence intervals for long-term unemployment ( >180 days ) , sickness absence ( >90 days ) and disability pension were calculated with Cox regression , adjusted for several risk markers.
M	Additional analyses were stratified by age ( below/above 30 years ).
R	Across all cohorts , suicide attempt was associated with subsequent labour market marginalisation.
R	Estimates were generally highest for disability pension [e.g. 2009 cohort: adjusted ( a ) HR = 2.7] , followed by sickness absence ( 2009 cohort: aHR = 2.3 ) and unemployment ( 2009 cohort: aHR = 1.5 ).
R	aHRs were higher in the 2004 and 2009 cohorts compared with the 1999 cohort.
R	For disability pension , for example , aHRs were 2.39 , 3.90 and 2.68 for the 1999 , 2004 and 2009 cohorts , respectively.
R	Stratification revealed marginal age differences.
C	It seems to have become more difficult for suicide attempters to establish themselves on the labour market in later cohorts , which might result from changes in social insurance regulations.
C	There were no considerable age differences.
B	Accurate calculation of dosages and safe administration of medications in clinical practice is an essential skill for the registered nurse.
B	Appropriate educational preparation of student nurses is the key to ensuring they become safe practitioners in the workforce.
B	A review of the literature on different approaches for teaching and assessing medication calculation with student nurses revealed three main factors that influenced student nurses' ability to calculate medications accurately and identify mistakes.
B	These factors include mathematical ability , particularly around multiplying with decimals , understanding medication formulas , and conceptualising medication dose.
P	This study evaluated teaching interventions that focused on improving the students' understanding of mathematical calculations , medication formulas and conceptualising medication doses.
M	Evaluation study with teaching interventions and Time 1 and Time 2 medication tests.
M	156 , 2nd year Bachelor of Nursing students from an Australian University.
M	The teaching interventions over 8 weeks included teaching decimals and basic mathematical skills , using the correct mathematical formula for the medication and linking the medication to the patient case study.
M	Time 1 and Time 2 medication tests out of ten , student demographics and reasons for attending tutorials were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching interventions.
R	For Time 1 medication test pre interventions , the mean was 7.3 with a mode of 8 out often.
R	Maths and incorrect medication formula were the most common mistake.
R	For Time 2 medication test post interventions , the mean was 9.3 with a mode of 10.
R	The most common reason for incorrect answer Time 2 was incorrect medication formula.
R	The students identified that the smaller tutorial sizes and remediation of errors was the main reason for continued attendance.
C	The teaching intervention improved the accuracy of students' medication calculation , specifically , understanding the correct formula to use and identifying errors of calculation.

B	To investigate the effect of psychological intervention on nutrient status of perioperative patients with lung cancer.
M	Overall , 176 lung cancer patients admitted to Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital , Shanghai China from 2015 to 2016 were divided into control group ( n= 88 ) and study group ( n= 88 ).
M	Conventional nursing strategy was adopted for patients in control group , while psychological nursing strategy was implemented for those in the study group , and the specific nursing efficiency was compared between the two groups.
M	In addition to the assessment with Symptom Checklist 90 ( SCL-90 ) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 36 ( QLQ-C30 ) , patients were required to fulfill the evaluations with nutrition risk screening 2002 ( NRS2002 ) and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment ( PG-SGA ).
R	After nursing care , significant amelioration in scores of SCL-90 and QLQ-C30 of patients were seen in the study group ( P< 0.05 ).
R	In the study group , the scores of NRS2002 and PG-SGA were all lower than those in the control group ( P< 0.001 ).
R	Besides , PG-SGA score was also significantly correlated with the levels of serum total proteins , serum albumin , hemoglobin , reduction in diet and weight ( P< 0.01 ) , while only reduction in diet and weight was obviously correlated with the score of NRS2002 ( P< 0.01 ).
R	Moreover , a significant correlation was identified between the scores of PG-SGA and NRS2002 ( P< 0.01 ).
C	Psychological intervention could effectively alleviate the psychological stress response and ameliorate the nutrient status of lung cancer patients in perioperative period , thereby reducing the negative feelings and increasing the life quality of patients.
B	ECT is a well-established treatment for severe depression.
B	The available data on psychosis are limited , but reliable.
B	Its therapeutic potential relies on the induction of a generalized seizure.
B	Besides other narcotics , methohexital and etomidate are used for general anesthesia in ECT.
B	Since prolonged seizures have been reported following the use of etomidate , it can be deduced that the substances might differ in their anticonvulsant properties , resulting in a lower increase in stimulus intensity during the course of treatment under etomidate.
B	Besides this hypothesis , we aimed to investigate the differential effects of etomidate and methohexital on clinical features , ECT parameters and side effects of the treatment.
M	We performed a retrospective analysis of treatment data of patients with affective and psychotic diagnosis who received general anesthesia for ECT either with etomidate or with methohexital.
R	ECT with etomidate and methohexital was equally effective.
R	During the course of therapies the administered electric charge increased significantly and equally in both treatment groups.
R	In the methohexital group , but not in the etomidate group , electroencephalographic seizure duration had a declining trend during the course of therapies.
R	We observed more side effects during and immediately after ECT in the methohexital group than in the etomidate group.
C	The limitations of this study are that the patients received various psychotropic co-medications , which influence ictal parameters differently , and , secondly , the study is based on a retrospective analysis.
C	The results of our analysis suggest that etomidate and methohexital affect ictal parameters to different extents.
C	Longer seizure duration and fewer side effects are in favor of etomidate.

P	This paper establishes foundational knowledge on development of polysubstance use among adolescents in the U.S. child welfare system ( CWS ).
M	Data on U.S. CWS adolescents from the National Study of Child and Adolescent Well-Being were examined for rates of alcohol , marijuana , and hard drug use ; and change in use over time.
R	Past 30-day absolute use was highest for alcohol , but daily/near-daily use highest for marijuana.
R	Marijuana use increased at later time points.
R	A correlated growth model suggested covariation in use of the substances.
R	A curve-of-factors model suggested that higher-order factors explain most variation in substance use , except at the last time point.
R	Those with lower use changed the most across time.
C	Subsequent research among CWS adolescents in the U.S. should consider substances jointly.
C	Prevention should focus on marijuana , and later periods of adolescence and CWS involvement.
C	Youth not thought of as at great risk upon entering the CWS may be most vulnerable.

M	The patients' socio-demographic and health data were collected , as were the number of sites where they were experiencing pain and the intensity of that pain.
M	The WHODAS 2.0 was administered again by a second interviewer within three days to determine its inter-rater reliability.
M	Construct validity was assessed according to the ability of WHODAS 2.0 to discriminate between patients with different numbers of pain sites and the correlation between WHODAS 2.0 scores and pain intensity.
M	Internal consistency was also assessed.
R	The Portuguese version of the WHODAS 2.0 is easily understood and has good internal consistency ( a = 0.84 ) , as well as , very good inter-rater reliability ( ICC = 0.95 ).
R	In addition , it was able to detect statistically significant differences between patients with different numbers of pain sites ( p < 0.01 ) and showed that higher levels of disability are associated with more intense pain ( r = 0.44 , p < 0.01 ) , indicating that it has construct validity.
C	The Portuguese version of the WHODAS 2.0 has shown to be reliable and valid when administered to patients with musculoskeletal pain.
P	To determine the associations between 1 ) exposure to sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSB ) in middle schools and student consumption of SSB during the school day ; and 2 ) school district policies about SSB and exposure to SSB in schools.
M	The strength of school district SSB policies was scored on three SSB policy indicators.
M	Student SSB consumption at school was assessed by a self-administered Beverage and Snack Questionnaire.
M	Exposure to SSB at school was defined as the number of vending slots and SSB venues as determined on-site at each school.
M	Multivariate analysis considered the multilevel nature of the data.
R	Data from 9151 students in 64 middle schools in 28 districts were used in the analysis.
R	With schools as the unit of analysis , the proportion of students who consumed any SSB at school ranged from 19.2% to 79.8%.
R	SSB exposure was a significant predictor of SSB consumption ( beta = .157 , p < .001 ).
R	SSB consumption was not significantly associated with the size of the school , the racial or ethnic composition of the school's students , or the proportion of students eligible for free and reduced price meals.
R	District SSB policy scores ranged from 0 to 6 with a mean score of 3.25 ( +/-2.15 ).
R	District SSB policy was a significant predictor of SSB exposure ( beta = -9.50 , p < .0002 ).
C	School district SSB policies and exposure to SSB in middle schools are associated with student SSB consumption.
C	Interventions to improve policies and their implementation may offer opportunities to improve the diets of adolescents.

B	Ethanol ( EtOH ) intake correlates with increased risk-taking , and sex differences exist in both EtOH use and risk-taking in humans and rats.
B	However , the interaction of sex and gonadal hormones to affect risk-taking under the influence of EtOH has not been determined.
B	This was the focus of the current study.
M	Adult Long-Evans rats ( n=18 males and females ) were gonadectomized and received hormone replacement at physiologic levels or blank implants ( n= 7-9/group ).
M	Risk-taking was assessed with probability discounting , requiring rats to choose between a small/certain reward and a large/uncertain reward delivered with decreasing probability throughout each daily session.
M	Before testing , rats received saline or EtOH ( 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg ) ip.
R	In males , EtOH increased preference for the large/uncertain reward lever ( F-2 ,F-28 =10.462 , p < 0.05 ).
R	However , there was no effect of EtOH on lever preference in females ( F-1 ,F-30 = 0.914 , p > 0.05 ).
R	At baseline , ORCHX+T males showed a greater preference for the large/uncertain reward lever then ORCHX males ( F-1 ,F-14= 13.805 , p < 0.05 ).
R	In females only , EtOH decreased choice latency relative to baseline ( F-1 ,F-10 = 7.25 , p < 0.05 ).
R	EtOH decreased loss sensitivity in both sexes , with all rats exhibiting decreased lose-shift ratios ( males: F-2 ,F-18 = 5.10 , p < 0.05 ; females F-2 ,F-10 = 4.37 , p < 0.05 ).
C	These results show that EtOH , sex , and hormones interact to influence decision making.
C	EtOH increases risk taking in males , but not in females.
C	However , EtOH selectively decreases choice latency in females , and decreases loss sensitivity in both sexes.
C	These findings are relevant to understanding human behavior , particularly in adolescents who experience increased hormone levels and often drink EtOH and engage in risky behavior.

B	The number of female veterans is increasing.
B	Veterans Administration ( VA ) enrollment increased over 40% from past eras.
B	However , little research has focused on their mental health.
B	We reviewed literature to examine associations of substance use with suicide in female veterans , identify research gaps , and inform future studies.
M	Google Scholar , Pub Med , and PsychINFO were searched using: substance use , female veteran , and suicide.
M	Exclusion criteria ( e.g. , not discussing U.S. veterans ) left 17 articles.
R	Nine studies examined completed suicide among veterans.
R	In most recent years , rates of deaths were greater for veterans than nonveterans , including females.
R	Completed suicide was associated with past trauma , young age , and a mental disorder.
R	Studies have often not addressed substance use.
R	Three studies examined completed suicide among VA treated veterans without examining substance use as an associated factor.
R	Rates of completed suicides were also higher among veterans than nonveterans , including females.
R	A large proportion of females also had a mental diagnosis.
R	Five studies examined substance use and attempted or completed suicide among VA treated veterans.
R	Veterans in poor mental health had increased odds of suicide mortality ; women with a substance use disorder ( SUD ) had a higher hazard ratio for completed suicide than men with a SUD.
R	Engagement in substance abuse treatment decreased odds of suicide attempt among veterans.
C	Available data suggest that suicide rates are higher among female veterans than women in the general population.
C	Substance use may increase the likelihood of suicidal behaviors among female veterans , particularly those with a mental diagnosis.

P	The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions of RNs on the implementation of safe patient handling and mobility ( SPHM ) programs in states with and without SPHM legislation.
B	Despite numerous strategies developed to reduce caregiver injuries , nurses are still experiencing work-related musculoskeletal injuries.
B	A comprehensive SPHM program has been found to be effective in reducing patient handling injuries among nurses.
M	By using data from 143 480 RNs working in 321 acute care hospitals in 44 US states , RNs' perceptions on 6 key aspects of SPHM programs were compared between states with and without SPHM legislation and among 11 unit types.
R	Registered nurses in states with SPHM legislation are more likely to report the implementation of SPHM programs in contrast with those in comparison states.
R	This finding was found for each of the 11 unit types.
C	This study provides evidence to support the positive effect of state-based efforts for legislative actions on the development and implementation of SPHM programs.
B	Delirium occurs commonly in hospitalized older patients but is poorly recognized.
B	Although there are a plethora of validated delirium screening tools , it is unclear which tool best suits particular populations.
P	To evaluate validation studies of delirium screening tools in non-critically ill hospital inpatients and provide guidance on the choice of screening tool.
M	The MEDLINE , CINAHL , and PsychInfo databases were searched for studies comparing delirium bedside screening tools with either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or International Classification of Diseases defined diagnosis of delirium in hospital inpatients.
M	Information was also drawn from conference proceedings and discussion with delirium researchers.
R	Thirty-one studies describing 21 delirium screening tools were included in the systematic review.
R	The majority of studies were conducted across a broad range of inpatient settings internationally in elderly inpatients , including patients with dementia but most excluded nonnative language speakers.
C	The Confusion Assessment Method was the most widely used instrument to identify delirium , however , specific training is required to ensure optimum performance.
C	The Delirium Rating Scale and its revised version performed best in the psychogeriatric population but requires an operator with psychiatric training.
C	The Nurses' Delirium Screening Checklist appears best suited to the surgical and recovery room setting.
C	The Single Question in Delirium shows promise in oncology patients.
C	The Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale , while demonstrating good measures of validity in the surgical and palliative care setting , may be better used a measure of delirium severity.
C	The 4As Test performed well when delirium was superimposed on dementia , but it requires further study.
B	Although hoarding symptoms have been traditionally conceptualized as part of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , recent data suggest that they may be more closely related to attention-deficit hyperactivity ( ADHD ) symptoms and , in particular , inattention.
B	The aim of the present epidemiological study was to investigate the association between retrospectively reported ADHD symptoms in childhood and lifetime hoarding symptoms.
M	Retrospectively reported childhood ADHD , and lifetime hoarding and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 in a random subsample of individuals ( n = 2 ,963 ) participating in a cross-sectional survey of the adult general population of nine European countries , as part of the World Mental Health ( WMH ) Surveys.
R	Lifetime hoarding symptoms were more common among individuals with childhood ADHD symptoms than those without ADHD symptoms ( 8.9% versus 2.7% , P = 0.024 ).
R	Childhood inattention ( but not hyperactivity ) was associated with lifetime hoarding symptoms ( OR = 6.04 , 95% CI = 3.59-10.1 ) and this association remained significant after controlling for the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
C	Longitudinal studies are now needed to explore the hypothesis that inattention symptoms in childhood may be a precursor of hoarding difficulties later in life.

B	Work satisfaction of nurses is important , as there is sufficient empirical evidence to show that it tends to affect individual , organizational and greater health and social outcomes.
B	Although there have been several studies of job satisfaction among nurses in South Africa , these are limited because they relate to studies of individual organizations or regions , use small samples or are dated.
B	This paper presents a national study that compares and contrasts satisfaction levels of nurses in both public and private sectors.
M	This was a cross-sectional survey of professional nurses conducted throughout South Africa using a pretested and self-administered questionnaire.
M	Univariate and bivariate statistical models were used to evaluate levels of satisfaction with various facets of work and to elicit the differences in satisfaction levels between different groups of nurses.
M	A total of 569 professional nurses participated in the study.
R	Private-sector nurses were generally satisfied , while public-sector nurses were generally dissatisfied.
R	Public-sector nurses were most dissatisfied with their pay , the workload and the resources available to them.
R	They were satisfied only with the social context of the work.
R	Private-sector nurses were dissatisfied only with their pay and career development opportunities.
R	Professional nurses in the more rural provinces , those intending to change sectors and those more likely not to be in their current positions within the next five years were also more likely to be dissatisfied with all facets of their work.
C	This study highlighted the overall dissatisfaction among South African nurses and confirmed the disparity between the levels of job satisfaction between the public and private sectors.
C	Health managers should address those factors that affect job satisfaction , and therefore retention , of nurses in South Africa.
C	Improving the work environment so that it provides a context congruent with the aspirations and values systems of nurses is more likely to increase the satisfaction of nurses and consequently have a positive effect on individual , organizational and health outcomes.
P	Agreement across methods for identifying students as inadequate responders or as learning disabled is often poor.
P	We report ( 1 ) an empirical examination of final status ( postintervention benchmarks ) and dual-discrepancy growth methods based on growth during the intervention and final status for assessing response to intervention and ( 2 ) a statistical simulation of psychometric issues that may explain low agreement.
M	After a Tier 2 intervention , final status benchmark criteria were used to identify 104 inadequate and 85 adequate responders to intervention , with comparisons of agreement and coverage for these methods and a dual-discrepancy method.
M	Factors affecting agreement were investigated using computer simulation to manipulate reliability , the intercorrelation between measures , cutoff points , normative samples , and sample size.
R	Identification of inadequate responders based on individual measures showed that single measures tended not to identify many members of the pool of 104 inadequate responders.
R	Poor to fair levels of agreement for identifying inadequate responders were apparent between pairs of measures.
R	In the simulation , comparisons across 2 simulated measures generated indices of agreement ( kappa ) that were generally low because of multiple psychometric issues inherent in any test.
C	Expecting excellent agreement between 2 correlated tests with even small amounts of unreliability may not be realistic.
C	Assessing outcomes based on multiple measures , such as level of curriculum-based measure performance and short norm-referenced assessments of fluency , may improve the reliability of diagnostic decisions.
B	Research studies increasingly suggest that inflammatory processes can cause depressive symptoms.
B	The risk for inflammation-associated depression seems to increase with adverse experiences in life during the early development of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and with chronic stress in adulthood.
B	Corresponding knowledge on the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated depression may facilitate early detection and treatment of this subgroup.
B	Patients and
M	Exploratory analysis on 558 patients with stress-related disorders.
M	We analyzed differences in the frequency of inflammatory diseases between depressed and non-depressed patients.
M	Additionally , we investigated chronic stress and early adversity as risk factors , and we examined whether depressive patients with recurrent inflammation show specific characteristics.
R	Depressed patients reported a higher frequency of recurrent inflammation and infections ; they suffered more frequently from feelings of sickness and malaise and reported more chronic stress and early adversity.
R	Patients with recurrent inflammation reported higher loads of early adversity and chronic stress.
R	Depressed patients with recurrent inflammation described more malaise , more stress-related infections , and poorer wound healing.
C	The results support the notion that relationships exist between inflammatory disorders , depression , and stress.
C	In patients with therapy-resistant depression showing these relationships , knowledge about specific characteristics is likely to ease early detection and adequate anti-inflammatory treatment.
B	Prevalence of depression is twice as high in women as in men , also in older adults.
B	Lack of social support is a risk factor for late-life depression.
B	The relation between depression and social support may be different for men and women.
M	Data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used to investigate gender differences in the relation between social support and depression in a population-based sample aged 55-85 years , with n = 2 ,823 at baseline and using the 13-year follow-up data on onset of depression.
R	Respondents without a partner in the household , with a small network , and with low emotional support were more often depressed , with men showing higher rates of depression than women.
R	A high need for affiliation was associated with depression in women but not in men.
R	Lack of a partner in the household and having a small network predicted onset of depression in men but not in women.
R	In respondents with high affiliation need and low social support , depression rates were higher , with men being more often depressed than women.
C	Low social support and a high need for affiliation were related to depression in later life , with men being more vulnerable for depression than women.
C	Considering the serious consequences of depression , especially in older people , it is important to identify the persons with low social support and a high need for affiliation , and to help them to increase their social support or to adjust their needs.
B	Peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) is commonly used in nursing for patients with leukemia.
B	The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors of Catheter-related infection ( CRI ) in patients with leukemia and to provide some nursing strategies based on the results.
M	Clinical data from 140 patients with leukemia between May 2014 and July 2016 in Haiyang People's Hospital , China were retrospectively analyzed.
M	We employed univariate analysis to explore the relationship of various factors , including leukemia types , puncture times , underlying diseases , Catheter indwelling time , hormones use , chemotherapy use , immune functions and seasons , with the incidence of CRI.
M	Further , multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the potential independent risk factors of CRI.
M	Bacterial culture was performed for etiological detection.
R	Among the 140 patients with leukemia , 25 cases were diagnosed as CRI , with the incidence of 17.9%.
R	Univariate analysis showed that puncture times , underlying diseases , catheter indwelling time , hormones use , chemotherapy use , immune functions and seasons were significantly correlated with the incidence of CRI.
R	Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that immune functions , puncture times and seasons were independent risk factors for CRI.
R	Etiological bacterial culture detected 20 strains of bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus: n=10 , Klebsiella pneumonia: n=4 , Corynebacterium: n=2 and other species: n=4 ) in 25 cases diagnosed with CRI.
C	Based on risk factors of CRI and its etiological distribution , appropriate nursing measures can be taken to reduce the incidence of CRI in patients with leukemia.
B	Patient information leaflets ( PILs ) are widely utilised within publically funded sexual health clinics to deliver sexual health-related information ( SHRI ) ; however , their continued value to clients in the era of social media is unclear.
B	This study aimed to evaluate clients' opinions on three newly developed PILs and examine client views on other forms of SHRI delivery.
M	An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was completed by clients attending the Western Sydney Sexual Health Centre ( WSSHC ) in 2012.
M	High-risk population ( HRP ) vs non-high-risk population ( non-HRP ) views on PILs vs alternative methods of SHRI delivery were analysed by using Mann-Whitney U , Wilcoxon , McNemar and chi( 2 ) tests.
R	Over half ( 210/315 ; ( 67% ) ) of the consecutive clients from a culturally diverse population completed the survey.
R	Sex workers ( SW ) and young people ( YP ) were significantly likely to have a high school education than non-HRP ( P < 0.039 and P < 0.032 ).
R	Overall , PILs , a clinic website and the Sexual Health Information Link ( SHIL ) , a state-wide website and telephone line , were ranked significantly higher as a means of SHRI delivery on a Likert scale than newer technologies including Facebook ( P < 0.001 ) , email ( P < 0.001 ) , mobile phone applications ( P < 0.001 ) , TVs in waiting rooms ( P < 0.001 ) and business cards ( P < 0.001 ).
R	There was no significant difference in opinion between HRP and non-HRP.
C	This study provides evidence for the ongoing use of PILs to deliver SHRI to clinic attendees , in conjunction with other forms of SHRI delivery such as websites and SHIL.
C	Novel methods may require additional consumer engagement and a greater understanding of specific population's needs.
B	Simulation practice evaluation has evolved from self-reports of indirect measures such as learner satisfaction and confidence to more direct measures of learning and performance improvement.
B	There is a need for psychometrically tested instruments to document direct learner outcomes.
M	This article describes the history , development , and initial psychometric testing of the Quint Leveled Clinical Competency Tool using both generalizability theory and traditional reliability testing.
M	The instrument can be used in both simulation and clinical environments and is designed to rate observed learner performance for ten competencies derived from Tanner's model.
C	The QLCCT instrument has a high inter-rater reliability ( 0.87 ) and coefficient alpha ( 0.83 ) , but generalizability theory analysis indicates that additional psychometric testing and factor analysis is necessary to complete full psychometric testing.

B	The provision of general practitioners ( GPs ) in Germany still relies mainly on the ratio of inhabitants to GPs at relatively large scales and barely accounts for an increased prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations.
B	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) is one of the major cost-intensive diseases with high rates of potentially preventable complications.
B	Provision of healthcare and access to preventive measures is necessary to reduce the burden of T2DM.
B	However , current studies on the spatial variation of T2DM in Germany are mostly based on survey data , which do not only underestimate the true prevalence of T2DM , but are also only available on large spatial scales.
B	The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the spatial distribution of T2DM at fine geographic scales and to assess location-specific risk factors based on data of the AOK health insurance.
M	To display the spatial heterogeneity of T2DM , a bivariate , adaptive kernel density estimation ( KDE ) was applied.
M	The spatial scan statistic ( SaTScan ) was used to detect areas of high risk.
M	Global and local spatial regression models were then constructed to analyze socio-demographic risk factors of T2DM.
R	T2DM is especially concentrated in rural areas surrounding Berlin.
R	The risk factors for T2DM consist of proportions of 65-79 year olds , 80 + year olds , unemployment rate among the 55-65 year olds , proportion of employees covered by mandatory social security insurance , mean income tax , and proportion of non-married couples.
R	However , the strength of the association between T2DM and the examined socio-demographic variables displayed strong regional variations.
C	The prevalence of T2DM varies at the very local level.
C	Analyzing point data on T2DM of northeastern Germany's largest health insurance provider thus allows very detailed , location-specific knowledge about increased medical needs.
C	Risk factors associated with T2DM depend largely on the place of residence of the respective person.
C	Future allocation of GPs and current prevention strategies should therefore reflect the location-specific higher healthcare demand among the elderly and socially underprivileged populations.
P	The present study examined Web-based information retrieval as a function of age for two information organization schemes: hierarchical organization and one organized around tags or keywords.
B	Older adults' performance in information retrieval tasks has traditionally been lower compared with younger adults'.
B	The cur-rent study examined the degree to which information organization moderated age-related performance differences on an information retrieval task.
B	The theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence may provide insight into different kinds of information architectures that may reduce age-related differences in computer-based information retrieval performance.
M	Fifty younger ( 18-23 years of age ) and 50 older ( 55-76 years of age ) participants browsed a Web site for answers to specific questions.
M	Half of the participants browsed the hierarchically organized system ( taxonomy ) , which maintained a one-to-one relationship between menu link and page , whereas the other half browsed the tag-based interface , with a many-to-one relationship between menu and page.
M	This difference was expected to interact with age-related differences in fluid and crystallized intelligence.
R	Age-related differences in information retrieval performance persisted ; however , a tag-based retrieval interface reduced age-related differences , as compared with a taxonomical interface.
C	Cognitive aging theory can lead to interface interventions that reduce age-related differences in performance with technology.
C	In an information retrieval paradigm , older adults may be able to leverage their increased crystallized intelligence to offset fluid intelligence declines in a computer-based information search task.
C	More research is necessary , but the results suggest that information retrieval interfaces organized around keywords may reduce age-related differences in performance.
P	Children's engagement in self-regulation is a strong and positive predictor of their social and academic success , making self-regulation an important focus for caregivers and clinicians.
P	The aims of this article are to provide a framework for understanding self-regulation and to identify strategies speech-language pathologists can use to integrate self-regulation work into their clinical practice.
M	Empirically supported considerations describing the developmental progression from co-regulation to self-regulation are outlined , and the effects of stress on self-regulation are discussed.
M	A clinical framework is provided to guide speech-language pathologists in considering stress and self-regulation in their clinical work.
M	Strategies are provided to a ) support speech language pathologists' employment of co-regulation as a method for mitigating the negative effects that stress can have on therapeutic efforts , and to b ) support children's development of skills ( i.e. executive functions , metacognition ) required to actively self-regulate.
C	Given that children's ability to attain a state of regulation is integral to attending , engaging , and learning from their environment , the information provided in this tutorial can be used to inform and enhance current clinical practice.
B	Turnover in the health workforce is a concern as it is costly and detrimental to organizational performance and quality of care.
B	Most studies have focused on the influence of individual and organizational factors on an employee's intention to quit.
B	Inspired by the observation that providing care is based on the duration of practices , tasks and processes ( issues of time ) rather than exchange values ( wages ) , this paper focuses on the influence of working-time characteristics and wages on an employee's intention to stay.
M	Using data from the WageIndicator web survey ( N = 5 ,323 ) , three logistic regression models were used to estimate health care employee's intention to stay for Belgium , Germany and the Netherlands.
M	The first model includes working-time characteristics controlling for a set of sociodemographic variables , job categories , promotion and organization-related characteristics.
M	The second model tests the impact of wage-related characteristics.
M	The third model includes both working-time-and wage-related aspects.
R	Model 1 reveals that working-time-related factors significantly affect intention to stay across all countries.
R	In particular , working part-time hours , overtime and a long commuting time decrease the intention to stay with the same employer.
R	The analysis also shows that job dissatisfaction is a strong predictor for the intention to leave , next to being a woman , being moderately or well educated , and being promoted in the current organization.
R	In Model 2 , wage-related characteristics demonstrate that employees with a low wage or low wage satisfaction are less likely to express an intention to stay.
R	The effect of wage satisfaction is not surprising ; it confirms that besides a high wage , wage satisfaction is essential.
R	When considering all factors in Model 3 , all effects remain significant , indicating that attention to working and commuting times can complement attention to wages and wage satisfaction to increase employees' intention to stay.
R	These findings hold for all three countries , for a variety of health occupations.
C	When following a policy of wage increases , attention to the issues of working time-including overtime hours , working part-time , and commuting time-and wage satisfaction are suitable strategies in managing health workforce retention.
P	The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 ( WHODAS 2.0 ) questionnaire is used internationally to assess function and disability.
P	The instrument has been translated into several languages , but no Hebrew version exists.
P	The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire among Hebrew speakers with and without hand injuries ( HI ).
M	The translated questionnaire was conducted among 155 uninjured subjects ( UI ) and 77 male workers with HI.
M	Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.
M	Test-retest reliability was assessed in UI subjects and calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICCagreement ).
M	Validity was evaluated by correlating the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 to the short-form of health survey ( SF-12 ) in UI subjects and comparing the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 scores and the Quick Disability of Arm , Shoulder , and Hand ( QDASH ) Outcome Measure in the HI group.
R	The Cronbach's alpha of the WHODAS 2.0 for the entire sample was alpha = 0.83.
R	The ICCagreement for test-retest reliability was 0.88.
R	A positive significant correlation was found between the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 and the QDASH ( r( s ) = 0.53 , p < .005 ).
C	The results support the reliability and validity of this Hebrew translation of the 12-item WHODAS 2.0.
B	The catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene is related to dopamine degradation and has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder ( MDD ).
B	However , how this gene affects brain function properties in MDD is still unclear.
M	Fifty patients with MDD and 35 cognitively normal participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan.
M	A voxelwise and data-drive global functional connectivity density ( gFCD ) analysis was used to investigate the main effects and the interactions of disease states and COMT rs4680 gene polymorphism on brain function.
R	We found significant group differences of the gFCD in bilateral fusiform area ( FFA ) , post-central and pre-central cortex , left superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) , rectal and superior temporal gyrus and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( vlPFC ) ; abnormal gFCDs in left STG were positively correlated with severity of depression in MDD group.
R	Significant disease x COMT interaction effects were found in the bilateral calcarine gyrus , right vlPFC , hippocampus and thalamus , and left SFG and FFA.
R	Further post-hoc tests showed a nonlinear modulation effect of COMT on gFCD in the development of MDD.
R	Interestingly , an inverted U-shaped modulation was found in the prefrontal cortex ( control system ) but U-shaped modulations were found in the hippocampus , thalamus and occipital cortex ( processing system ).
C	Our study demonstrated nonlinear modulation of the interaction between COMT and depression on brain function.
C	These findings expand our understanding of the COMT effect underlying the pathophysiology of MDD.

P	Spoken language serves as a primary means of social interaction , but speech and language skills change with age , a potential source of age-related stereotyping.
P	The goals of this study were to examine how accurately age could be estimated from language samples , to determine which speech and language cues were most informative , and to assess the impact of perceived age on judgments of the speakers' communication skills.
M	We analyzed narratives from 84 speakers aged 30-89 years to identify age-related differences and compared these differences to factors affecting perceptions of age and communicative competence.
M	Three groups of raters estimated the speakers' ages and judged the quality of their communication: 44 listeners listened to audio-recorded narratives , 51 readers read transcripts of the narratives , and 24 voice raters listened to 10-s samples of speech extracted from one of the narratives.
R	Older speakers spoke more slowly but showed minimal linguistic differences compared to younger speakers.
R	Speakers' ages were estimated quite accurately , even from 10-s samples.
R	Estimates were largely based on cues available in the acoustic signal-speech rate and vocal characteristics-so listeners were more accurate than readers.
R	However , an overreliance on these cues also contributed to overestimates of speakers' ages.
R	Communication ratings were not strongly related to perceived age but were influenced by various aspects of speech and language.
R	In particular , speakers who produced longer narratives and spoke more quickly were judged to be better communicators.
C	Speakers tend to be judged on relatively superficial aspects of spoken language , in part because age-related change is most evident at these levels.
C	Implications of these findings for age-related theories of stereotyping and speech-language intervention are discussed.
B	Despite concerns over the harmful health effects of semiconductor production , epidemiological studies have shown mixed results.
P	We aim to critically appraise epidemiologic studies to date , and to suggest future research and actions to protect workers in semiconductor industry.
M	Epidemiologic studies were identified through electronic database searches , review of reference lists of relevant published works , and expert consultations , and were narratively reviewed.
R	Most evidence suggests reproductive risks from fabrication jobs , including spontaneous abortion ( SAB ) , congenital malformation , and reduced fertility.
R	Although chemicals have been suspected as causal agents , knowledge of the likely contribution( s ) from specific exposures is still limited.
R	Evidence of cancer risk seems to be equivocal.
R	However , the available studies had serious limitations including healthy worker effects ( HWEs ) , information bias , and insufficient power , all of which are associated with underestimation.
R	Nevertheless , excess risks for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) , leukemia , brain tumor , and breast cancer were observed.
C	Monitoring and innovative research based on international collaboration with a focus on sentinel events are required.
B	Survey data indicate that individuals with disabilities in the United States often experience less advantageous economic and social resources than individuals without disabilities.
B	Furthermore , they often reside with other individuals with disabilities in the same household.
B	However , less is known about resource availability when multiple child and adult household members have a disability.
P	We use child-level data from the 2000 Census to examine the relationship between aggregation of disability in households with children and education , labor force participation , poverty level , and inadequate housing.
M	We utilize tabular analysis and Kruskale-Wallis tests to examine how resources in education , employment , income , and housing adequacy compare for children with disabilities who are the only member of their household with a disability , children with disabilities who live in a household with at least one other member with a disability , children without disabilities who live in a household where no other member has a disability , and children without disabilities who live in a household where at least one other member has a disability.
R	Among children without a disability , 86% live in a household in which no other member has a disability.
R	Among children with a disability , 53% live in a household in which no other adult or child has a disability.
R	Poverty , inadequate housing , and low adult education were more than two times more likely - and adult unemployment over five times more likely e in households with multiple members with disability versus households without disability.
C	There is a high prevalence of aggregation of adults and children with disability in households of children with disability.
C	These households have substantially fewer resources than households who do not have children or adults with disabilities.

B	Psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are prevalent in the general population and are associated with poor mental health and a higher risk of psychiatric disorders.
B	The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-Positive ( CAPE-P15 ) scale is a self-screening questionnaire to address subclinical positive psychotic symptoms ( PPEs ) in community contexts.
B	Although its psychometric properties seem to be adequate to screen PLEs , further research is needed to evaluate certain validity aspects , particularly its internal structure and its functioning in different populations.
P	To uncover the optimal factor structure of the CAPE-P15 scale in adolescents aged 13 to 18 years using factorial analysis methods suitable to manage categorical variables.
M	A sample of 727 students from six secondary public schools and 245 university students completed the CAPE-P15.
M	The dimensionality of the CAPE-P15 was tested through exploratory structural equation models ( ESEMs ).
M	Based on the ESEM results , we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) to contrast two factorial structures that potentially underlie the symptoms described by the scale: a ) three correlated factors and b ) a hierarchical model composed of a general PLE factor plus three specific factors ( persecutory ideation , bizarre experiences , and perceptual abnormalities ).
R	The underlying structure of PLEs assessed by the CAPE-P15 is consistent with both multidimensional and hierarchical solutions.
R	However , the latter show the best fit.
R	Our findings reveal the existence of a strong general factor underlying scale scores.
R	Compared with the specific factors , the general factor explains most of the common variance observed in subjects' responses.
C	The findings suggest that the factor structure of subthreshold psychotic experiences addressed by the CAPE-P15 can be adequately represented by a general factor and three separable specific traits , supporting the hypothesis according to which there might be a common source underlying PLEs.

P	The purpose of this study was to pilot a "hybrid" style journal club and determine whether measurable effects could be detected over 8-weeks' time on evidence-based practice ability , desire , behaviors , use , and barriers.
B	Journal clubs have been suggested as a method to increase nurses' confidence with using research evidence to guide practice.
B	However , it is yet unknown how nurse educators can best implement effective programs for clinicians with varying schedules , education levels , and research skills.
M	Thirty-six participants from one large urban United States hospital ( 72% registered nurses ) were invited to access bi-weekly interdisciplinary journal club activities.
M	Nurse educators created curriculum focused on clinical problem solving that was offered via in-person sessions or a social media site.
M	A pretest-posttest no control group design was used to measure impacts of those engaged in journal club activities.
M	Data were collected using a combination of validated evidence-based practice instruments and program participation records.
R	A two-tailed paired t test showed significant increases over 8 weeks' time in evidence-based practice use ( p = .002 ) and behaviors ( p = .007 ).
R	Slight preference for in-person sessions was reported , although greater participation was reflected in online activities.
R	Mean satisfaction ratings were high ; however , attrition rates suggest that more is needed to maximize clinician engagement.
C	A hybrid method using online and in-person sessions was feasible and adaptive for varying learning styles and work schedules.
C	Positive changes in measurements were detected among journal club participants.
C	Instruments were identified that may be useful for trialing similar programs intended to increase evidence-based practice self-efficacy , use , behaviors , and ability.

B	In line with recent research on the role of the inner context of organizations in implementation effectiveness , this study extends research on organizational citizenship behavior ( OCB ) to the domain of evidence-based practice ( EBP ) implementation.
B	OCB encompasses those behaviors that go beyond what is required for a given job that contribute to greater organizational effectiveness.
B	The goal of this study was to develop and test a measure of implementation citizenship behavior ( ICB ) or those behaviors that employees perform that go above and beyond what is required in order to support EBP implementation.
M	The primary participants were 68 supervisors from ten mental health agencies throughout California.
M	Items measuring ICB were developed based on past research on OCB and in consultation with experts on EBP implementation in mental health settings.
M	Supervisors rated 357 of their subordinates on ICB and implementation success.
M	In addition , 292 of the subordinates provided data on self-rated performance , attitudes towards EBPs , work experience , and full-time status.
M	The supervisor sample was randomly split , with half used for exploratory factor analyses and the other half for confirmatory factor analyses.
M	The entire sample of supervisors and subordinates was utilized for analyses assessing the reliability and construct validity of the measure.
R	Exploratory factor analyses supported the proposed two-factor structure of the Implementation Citizenship Behavior Scale ( ICBS ): ( 1 ) Helping Others and ( 2 ) Keeping Informed.
R	Confirmatory factor analyses with the other half of the sample supported the factor structure.
R	Additional analyses supported the reliability and construct validity for the ICBS.
C	The ICBS is a pragmatic brief measure ( six items ) that captures critical behaviors employees perform to go above and beyond the call of duty to support EBP implementation , including helping their fellow employees on implementation-related activities and keeping informed about issues related to EBP and implementation efforts.
C	The ICBS can be used by researchers to better understand the outcomes of improved organizational support for implementation ( i.e. , implementation climate ) and the proximal predictors of implementation effectiveness.
C	The ICBS can also provide insight for organizations , practitioners , and managers by focusing on key employee behaviors that should increase the probability of implementation success.
B	Women are an integral part of Reserve and National Guard units and active duty armed forces of the United States.
B	Deployment to conflict and war zones is a difficult experience for both soldiers and their families.
B	On return from deployment , all soldiers face the challenge of reintegration into family life and society , but those from the National Guard and Reserve units face the additional challenge of reintegration in relative isolation from other soldiers.
B	There is limited research about the reintegration experiences of women and the functioning of the families during reintegration following deployment.
P	The goal was to document postdeployment family reintegration experiences of women in the National Guard.
M	Semistructured interviews were conducted with 42 female members of Midwestern National Guard units.
M	Directed content analysis was used to identify categories of experiences related to women's family reintegration.
R	Five categories of postdeployment experience for female soldiers and their families were identified: Life Is More Complex , Loss of Military Role , Deployment Changes You , Reestablishing Partner Connections , and Being Mom Again.
C	The categories reflected individual and family issues , and both need to be considered when soldiers and their families seek care.
C	Additional research is needed to fully understand the specific impact of gender on women's reintegration.
B	It is well-established in the United States that incarceration negatively influences women's health , and researchers have called for examinations of the health effects of criminal justice contact more broadly.
B	This study uses the behavioral model for vulnerable populations to document the prevalence of illness and health risks for recently arrested women , and examines potential ways that illness and health risks are associated with health service use across health care settings.
M	We conducted a mediation analysis using pooled data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( 2010-2014 ).
R	These findings reveal that recent arrest is associated with different types of health care use among women.
R	Specifically , women recently arrested are hospitalized and seek care at the emergency department at higher rates than non-recently arrested women and this may be associated with their vulnerable mental and behavioral health status.
C	The findings suggest an increasing overlap between criminal justice and public health sectors.
C	Increased access to appropriate health services is a necessary strategy to reduce resource intensive hospitalizations and emergency department use among women experiencing a recent arrest.

B	The study was designed to describe the characteristics of all-terrain vehicle ( ATV ) rider fatalities and fatal crashes involving ATVs that occur on public roads.
M	Information on fatal crashes occurring on public roads during the years 2007-2011 was obtained from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System ( FARS ).
R	There were 1 ,701 ATV rider deaths during the 5-year study period , including 1 ,482 drivers , 210 passengers , and 9 with unknown rider status.
R	An additional 19 non-ATV occupants , primarily motorcyclists , died in crashes with ATVs.
R	About half of the ATV passenger deaths were teenagers or younger , and the majority of passenger deaths were female.
R	Ninety percent of the fatally injured drivers were 16 or older , and 90% were male.
R	The crashes were most likely to occur in relatively rural states , and in rural areas within states.
R	Only 13% of drivers and 6% of passengers killed wore helmets.
R	Forty-three percent of the fatally injured drivers had blood alcohol concentrations ( BACs ) of 0.08% or greater.
R	Seventy-five percent of the fatal crashes involved single ATVs ; 5% involved multiple ATVs but no non-ATV vehicles , and 20% involved ATVs and non-ATVs , usually passenger vehicles.
R	Speeding was reported by police as a contributing factor in the crash for 42% of ATV drivers in single-vehicle crashes and 19% of ATV drivers in multiple-vehicle crashes.
C	Although ATVs are designed exclusively for off-road use , many ATV occupant deaths occur on roads , despite most states having laws prohibiting many types of on-road use.
C	Attention needs to be given to ways to reduce these deaths.

B	Respiratory problems have been shown to be associated with the development of panic anxiety.
B	Family members play an essential role for children to emotionally manage their symptoms.
B	This study aimed to examine the relation between severity of respiratory symptoms in children with asthma and separation anxiety.
B	Relying on direct observation of family interactions during a mealtime , a model is tested whereby family interactions mediate the relation between asthma severity and separation anxiety symptoms.
M	Sixty-three children ( ages 9-12 years ) with persistent asthma were interviewed via the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV ; family interactions were assessed via direct observation of a mealtime ; primary caregivers completed the Childhood Asthma Severity Scale ; youth pulmonary function was ascertained with pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry ; adherence to asthma medications was objectively tracked for six weeks.
R	Poorer pulmonary function and higher functional asthma severity were related to higher numbers of separation anxiety symptoms.
R	Controlling for medication adherence , family interaction patterns mediated the relationship between poorer pulmonary function and child separation anxiety symptoms.
C	Family mealtime interactions may be a mechanism by which respiratory disorders are associated with separation anxiety symptoms in children , potentially through increasing the child's capacity to cognitively frame asthma symptoms as less threatening , or through increasing the child's sense of security within their family relationships.
B	Gay , lesbian , and bisexual ( GLB ) individuals appear to have an increased likelihood of alcohol use disorders and treatment utilization for alcohol related problems compared to heterosexual individuals.
B	Despite this increase , treatment utilization rates among GLB individuals remain low.
B	In an effort to address this , our paper examined whether or not GLB individuals encounter unique barriers when pursuing treatment for alcohol related problems.
M	Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions ( NESARC ) , we examined service sector specific factors , some of which included ( a ) utilization rates , ( b ) self-reported treatment barriers , and ( c ) whether or not there were emergent differences among GLB individuals , after controlling for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.
R	Findings indicated that GLB individuals reported higher severity rates for alcohol use disorders.
R	when compared to heterosexual individuals , and were significantly more likely to utilize treatment services for alcohol related problems , however , not across all treatment sectors.
R	While similar patterns were observed when examining barriers to treatment , bisexual individuals reported significantly more barriers than heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals.
C	These findings underscored the importance of identifying and developing interventions that addresses treatment barriers associated with alcohol use service utilization among GLB populations , and creating improved outreach and education programs to better address stigmas associated with substance use and sexuality.

B	The relationships between involvement in sports and alcohol consumption appear to be complex in the alcohol literature.
B	In this study we aimed to examine this link among French students , taking into account their sports characteristics.
B	We also examined variations in alcohol use among sport sciences students between 2002 and 2006 , and the difference in alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking among sport sciences , law and pharmacy students.
M	repeated survey ; cross-sectional study ;
M	self-questionnaire survey ;
M	French ( south-east France ) sport sciences ( n = 693 ) , law ( n = 325 ) and pharmacy ( n = 338 ) students ( females = 58% ).
R	In 2002 , 38% of the mate sport sciences students reported repeated heavy episodic drinking , and this proportion has risen to 48% in 2006 ( p < 0.05 ).
R	When compared to law and pharmacy students , female and male sport sciences students were less likely to report repeated heavy episodic drinking ( p < 0.05 ).
R	Engaging in physical activity ( whether or not it takes place within an institution ) and practising martial art were negatively related to heavy episodic drinking ( p < 0.05 ).
R	Other factors related to heavy episodic drinking were gender-specific: among males , practising sport in a formal context , team sports , and competitive participation at a departmental or regional level represented risk factors ( p < 0.05 ) , while practising an individual sport was a protective factor among females ( p < 0.05 ).
C	This study corroborated the importance to take into account the context of practice and the type of sport practised to examine the link between sport participation and alcohol consumption.
C	The normative context of peer socialization among competitive and team sports participants seemed to play a role in alcohol use.
C	Further studies are needed to confirm the role of this putative factor.

B	Environmental factors such as early drug exposure influence drug abuse vulnerability , and evidence also suggests that drug abuse is highly heritable.
B	The purpose of the present study was to determine whether environmental and genetic factors interact to produce additive drug abuse vulnerability.
M	An animal model of relapse was used to examine the effects of adolescent nicotine exposure on adult cocaine seeking in rats bred for high ( HiS ) and low ( LoS ) saccharin intake.
M	Rats from HiS and LoS progenitor lines received s.c. injections of nicotine for 10 days ( postnatal days 22-31 ).
M	Rats were then allowed to reach adulthood and were trained to lever press for cocaine infusions.
M	During each self-administration session , the house light ( HL ) was illuminated and each lever press activated a set of lights adjacent to the lever ( LL ).
M	Following cocaine self-administration , the HL and LL were deactivated , cocaine solutions were replaced with saline , and rats extinguished lever pressing.
M	Subsequently , rats were tested under a multi-component reinstatement procedure consisting of: ( 1 ) cue-induced reinstatement with LL alone and the HL presented alone , ( 2 ) cocaine-induced reinstatement without LL and HL present , ( 3 ) and cocaine-induced reinstatement with LL present.
R	The results indicated that adolescent nicotine exposure sensitized the reinstatement of cocaine seeking during adulthood in HiS ( but not LoS ) rats when lever pressing resulted in LL cue presentations.
R	In addition , following administration of the cocaine priming injection , rats exposed to nicotine ( vs. saline ) during adolescence ( LoS and HiS ) engaged in more cocaine seeking under the cocaine-primed reinstatement condition when lever pressing illuminated the LL
C	These results suggest that drug abuse vulnerability may be a function of early life exposure to drugs of abuse in addition to genetic influences.

P	Completing cancer treatment involves significant challenges for patients as well as their families.
P	This study aimed to explore couples' experiences of colorectal ( bowel ) cancer , focusing on the transition after treatment.
M	Separate , semi-structured interviews were conducted within 12 months of completing treatment with a purposeful sample of ten participants , comprising five patient partner dyads.
M	Data were analysed using the Framework approach , incorporating dyadic analysis to compare narratives within as well as between couples.
R	Three main themes were elaborated: the process of recovery , the relationship dynamics , and the mixed experiences of healthcare services.
R	The lasting impact of cancer following completion of treatment was evident for patients as well as their partners , and was shaped by their reciprocal influence on each other.
C	The findings underscore the value of a systemic approach for supporting couples during recovery from colorectal cancer and demonstrate the need for consistency of healthcare provision across the cancer trajectory , including post-treatment.

B	In a context of population ageing , it is a priority for planning and prevention to understand the socioeconomic ( SE ) patterning of functional limitations and its consequences on healthcare needs.
B	This paper aims at measuring the gender and SE inequalities in functional limitations and their age of onset among the Southern European elderly ; then , we evaluate how functional status is linked to formal and informal care use.
M	We used Portuguese , Italian and Spanish data from the Survey of Health , Ageing and Retirement in Europe ( SHARE ) of 2011 ( n = 9233 ).
M	We constructed a summary functional limitation score as the sum of two variables: i ) Activities of Daily Living ( ADL ) and ii ) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ).
M	We modelled the functional limitation as a function of age , gender , education , subjective poverty , employment and marital status using multinomial logit models.
M	We then estimated how functional limitation affected informal and formal care demand using negative binomial and logistic models.
R	Women were 2.3 percentage points ( pp ) more likely to experience severe functional limitation than men , and overcame a 10% probability threshold of suffering from severe limitation around 5 years earlier.
R	Subjective poverty was associated with a 3.1 pp.
R	higher probability of severe functional limitation.
R	Having a university degree reduced the probability of severe functional limitation by 3.5 pp.
R	as compared to none educational level.
R	Discrepancies were wider for the oldest old: women aged 65-79 years old were 3.3 pp.
R	more likely to suffer severe limitations , the excess risk increasing to 15.5 pp.
R	among those older than 80.
R	Similarly , educational inequalities in functional limitation were wider at older ages.
R	Being severely limited was related with a 32.1 pp.
R	higher probability of receiving any informal care , as compared to those moderately limited.
R	Finally , those severely limited had on average 3.2 hospitalization days and 4.6 doctor consultations more , per year , than those without limitations.
C	Functional limitations are unequally distributed , hitting women and the worse-off earlier and more severely , with consequences on care needs.
C	Considering the burden on healthcare systems and families , public health policies should seek to reduce current inequalities in functional limitations.
P	Systematically identify and summarize literature on neurophysiological methods to test the effectiveness of BoNT , discuss methodological aspects , and recommend best techniques for clinical and research settings.
M	Electronic databases were searched using specific keywords.
M	Reviews and reference lists were hand-checked to find relevant studies.
M	Studies in adults with focal limb spasticity were included.
R	Over 300 articles were scanned for relevance , and a list of 90 relevant articles was made.
R	After excluding reviews and studies in healthy controls or non-spasticity related BoNT , 22 articles were reviewed.
R	Neurophysiological techniques included electromyography ( EMG ; n = 11 ) , electrical nerve stimulation ( n = 13 ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ; n = 1 ) , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ; n = 1 ) , reflex threshold ( n = 4 ) , Achilles tendon reflex ( n = 1 ) , reflex latency ( n = 1 ).
C	Maximum M-wave amplitude ( M-max ) and stretch reflex threshold techniques were successfully used to measure the neurophysiological effects of BoNT and have high test-retest reliability.
C	EMG techniques require effective magnitude normalization techniques and establishing test-retest reliability.
C	Serial electrical nerve stimulation can be incorporated into clinical practice to assist in follow-up.
C	We recommend using M-max and stretch reflex threshold techniques to assess the neurophysiological effects.
P	To analyze the determinants for the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis linked to the conditions of vulnerability.
M	This is an ecological study , whose spatial analysis unit was the Territorial Analysis Unit in Araguaina , State of Tocantins , Brazil , from 2007 to 2012.
M	We have carried out an analysis of the sociodemographic and urban infrastructure situation of the municipality.
M	Normalized primary indicators were calculated and used to construct the indicators of vulnerability of the social structure , household structure , and urban infrastructure.
M	From them , we have composed a vulnerability index.
M	Kernel density estimation was used to evaluate the density of cases of human visceral leishmaniasis , based on the coordinates of the cases.
M	Bivariate global Moran's I was used to verify the existence of spatial autocorrelation between the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis and the indicators and index of vulnerability.
M	Bivariate local Moran's I was used to identify spatial clusters.
R	We have observed a pattern of centrifugal spread of human visceral leishmaniasis in the municipality , where outbreaks of the disease have progressively reached central and peri-urban areas.
R	There has been no correlation between higher incidences of human visceral leishmaniasis and worse living conditions.
R	Statistically significant clusters have been observed between the incidences of human visceral leishmaniasis in both periods analyzed ( 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012 ) and the indicators and index of vulnerability.
C	The environment in circumscribed areas helps as protection factor or increases the local vulnerability to the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis.
C	The use of methodology that analyzes the conditions of life of the population and the spatial distribution of human visceral leishmaniasis is essential to identify the most vulnerable areas to the spread/maintenance of the disease.
B	Little is known about how health care professionals deal with ethical challenges in mental health care , especially when not making use of a formal ethics support service.
B	Understanding this is important in order to be able to support the professionals , to improve the quality of care , and to know in which way future ethics support services might be helpful.
M	Within a project on ethics , coercion and psychiatry , we executed a focus group interview study at seven departments with 65 health care professionals and managers.
M	We performed a systematic and open qualitative analysis focusing on the question: 'How do health care professionals deal with ethical challenges?'
M	We deliberately did not present a fixed definition or theory of ethical challenge.
R	We categorized relevant topics into three subthemes: 1 ) Identification and presence of ethical challenges ; 21 What do the participants actually do when dealing with an ethical challenge?
R	; and 3 ) The significance of facing ethical challenges.
R	Results varied from dealing with ethical challenges every day and appreciating it as a positive part of working in mental health care , to experiencing ethical challenges as paralyzing burdens that cause a lot of stress and hinder constructive team cooperation.
R	Some participants reported tl-lat they do not have the time and tl-lat they lack a specific methodology.
R	Quite often , informal and retrospective ad hoc meetings in small teams were organized.
R	Participants struggled with what makes a challenge an ethical challenge and whether it differs from a professional challenge.
R	When dealing with ethical challenges , a number of participants experienced difficulties handling disagreement in a constructive way.
R	Furthermore , some participants plead for more attention for underlying intentions and justification's of treatment decision's.
C	The interviewed health care professionals dealt with ethical challenges in many different ways , often in an informal , implicit and reactive manner.
C	This study revealed nine different categories of what health care professionals implicitly or explicitly conceive as 'ethical challenges'.
C	Future research should focus on how ethics support services , such as ethics reflection groups or moral case deliberation , can be of help with respect to dealing with ethical challenges and value disagreements in a constructive way.
B	Family caregivers in palliative care have a need for knowledge and support from health professionals , resulting in the need for educational and supportive interventions.
B	However , research has mainly focused on the experiences of family caregivers taking part in interventions.
B	To gain an increased understanding of complex interventions , it is necessary to integrate the perspectives of health professionals and family caregivers.
B	Hence , the aim of this study is to explore the perspectives of health professionals and family caregivers of delivering and participating in a psycho-educational intervention in palliative home care.
M	A psycho-educational intervention was designed for family caregivers based on a theoretical framework describing family caregiver's need for knowing , being and doing.
M	The intervention was delivered over three sessions , each of which included a presentation by healthcare professionals from an intervention manual.
M	An interpretive descriptive design was chosen and data were collected through focus group discussions with health professionals and individual interviews with family caregivers.
M	Data were analysed using framework analysis.
R	From the perspectives of both health professionals and family caregivers , the delivering and participating in the intervention was a positive experience.
R	Although the content was not always adjusted to the family caregivers' individual situation , it was perceived as valuable.
R	Consistently , the intervention was regarded as something that could make family caregivers better prepared for caregiving.
R	Health professionals found that the work with the intervention demanded time and engagement from them and that the manual needed to be adjusted to suit group characteristics , but the experience of delivering the intervention was still something that gave them satisfaction and contributed to them finding insights into their work.
C	The theoretical framework used in this study seems appropriate to use for the design of interventions to support family caregivers.
C	In the perspectives of health professionals and family caregivers , the psycho-educational intervention had important benefits and there was congruence between the two groups in that it provided reward and support.
C	In order for health professionals to carry out psycho-educational interventions , they may be in need of support and supervision as well as securing appropriate time and resources in their everyday work.
B	Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has become the cornerstone of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer.
B	However , treatments are associated with a number of adverse effects that collectively are referred to as andropause syndrome , or the male menopause.
P	This study explored the experience and impact of andropause symptoms , particularly hot flashes , among men undergoing ADT for metastatic prostate cancer.
M	Twenty-one men receiving ADT for metastatic prostate cancer underwent a qualitative interview focusing on the adverse effects of ADT and the impact of these symptoms on daily living and coping strategies.
R	The most frequently mentioned adverse effects were hot flashes and night sweats , gynecomastia , cognitive decline , and changes in sexual function.
R	Hot flashes did impact on everyday functioning , and night sweats regularly disturbed sleep patterns and led to participants feeling tired and irritable.
R	Participants reported a lack of control over their hot flashes and night sweats.
R	There was reluctance among our sample to disclose the type of symptoms experienced to others.
C	The occurrence of andropause symptoms , including hot flashes and night sweats , was common among this sample.
C	Participants reported a range of cognitive and behavioral responses to these symptoms.
C	There was some reluctance about discussing a prostate cancer diagnosis or the occurrence of symptoms with others.
C	The findings have implications for a range of individual and couple interventions to manage the impact of this constellation of symptoms.
B	It is unclear whether bereaved parents with Complicated Grief ( CG ) struggle with their grief differently than others with CG.
B	This study addressed this question by comparing CG severity , CC-related symptoms , thoughts and behaviors , and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses of bereaved parents with CG to the diagnoses and symptoms of others with CG.
M	Baseline data from 345 participants enrolled in the Healing Emotions After Loss ( HEAL ) study , a multi-site CG treatment study , were used to compare parents with CG ( n=75 ) to others with CG ( n=275 ).
M	Data from the parent group was then used to compare parents with CG who had lost a younger child ( n=24 ) to parents with CG who had lost an older child ( n=34 ).
M	Demographic and loss-related data were also gathered and used to control for confounders between groups.
R	Parents with CG demonstrated slightly higher levels of CG ( p=0.025 ) , caregiver self-blame ( p=0.007 ) , and suicidality ( p=0.025 ) than non-parents with CG.
R	Parents who had lost younger children were more likely to have had a wish to be dead since the loss than parents who had lost older children ( p=0.041 ).
C	All data were gathered from a treatment research study , limiting the generalizability of these results.
C	No corrections were made for multiple comparisons.
C	The comparison of parents who lost younger children to parents who lost older children was limited by a small sample size.
C	Even in the context of CG , the relationship to the deceased may have a bearing on the degree and severity of grief symptoms and associated features.
C	Bereaved parents with CG reported more intense CG , self-blame , and suicidality than other bereaved groups with CG , though this finding requires confirmation.
C	The heightened levels of suicidal ideation experienced by parents with CG , especially after losing a younger child , suggest the value of routinely screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this group.

P	Stroke survivors report poorer self-rated health ( SRH ) compared to the general population but there is limited understanding on what contributes to SRH.
P	This ethnographic study examined the individual and contextual factors that shape stroke survivors' SRH in a rural middle income country situated in South East Asia.
M	Ethnographic methods which encompasses various data collection methods from different data sources were used in this study to describe the socio-cultural context of 16 stroke survivors living in a rural village.
M	Within this context , the experiences of these participants were then interpreted in terms of what contributed to their perception of health and recovery , juxtaposed with objectively measure physical and cognitive states.
R	SRH reflected the post stroke adjustment of stroke survivors.
R	Better SRH was influenced by good post-stroke adjustment that was achieved by a combination of physical functioning , cognitive functioning , emotional well-being and family support.
R	Poorer SRH appear to reflect poor post-stroke adjustment regardless of the objective physical and cognitive states of the stroke survivors.
R	It was also observed that cognitive deficits , though its presence was acknowledged by participants , were usually not taken into account when rating SRH.
R	However , while physical functioning was perceived by participants to directly impact SRH , the presence of cognitive deficits ( often in tandem with depressive symptoms ) indirectly complicated the recovery of physical functions treasured by participants.
C	Stroke survivors reporting poorer SRH warrant further attention and intervention from health practitioners supporting the longer-term needs of stroke survivors in similar settings.
B	22q11.2DS is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans , usually associated with speech and language delay ( SLD ).
B	Approximately 75% of children with 22q11.2 microdeletion have congenital heart malformations ( CHM ) which after infant open-heart surgery might lead to SLD.
P	The purpose of this study was to determine whether factors associated with microdeletion contribute to SLD in children with 22q11.2DS.
M	We compared speech and language abilities of two groups of school-aged children: those with 22q11.2 microdeletion ( E1 ) and those with the phenotype resembling 22q11.2DS but without the microdeletion ( E2 ).
M	An age-matched group of typically developing children was also tested.
R	The obtained results revealed that children from group E1 have lower level of speech and language abilities compared to children from group E2 and control group.
R	Additionally , mild to moderate SLD was detected in children from group E2 compared to children from the control group.
C	The obtained results imply that both CHM after infant open-heart surgery and other factors associated with 22q11.2 microdeletion , contribute to SLD in patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion.
C	Based on this , we could postulate that there is/are some potential candidate gene( s ) , located in the 22q11.2 region , whose function could be important for speech and language development.

B	This paper examined the implications of the business cycle for cannabis and alcohol use.
B	What little we know about cannabis use suggests that young Americans ( teenagers and adults in their early 20s ) seem more inclined to use illicit drugs and to use them more frequently with rises in the unemployment rate.
B	In contrast , a more fulsome alcohol literature suggests that participation in drinking is unaffected by the business cycle.
B	Heavy drinkers drink less during economic downturns and their reduced use counteracts the fact that light drinkers might drink a little more.
M	Using individual level data from repeated cross-sections of Australia's National Drug Strategy Household Survey ( NDSHS ) , spanning 1991-2007 , this study examined the relationship between cannabis and alcohol use of Australians aged 14-49 years and the unemployment rate and real income per capita , two indicators of the business cycle.
R	Australians in their late 20s , 30s and 40s drink less frequently during economic downturns.
R	If unemployment rate rises are accompanied by falls in income per capita , younger Australians will also drink less frequently.
R	Recent participation in cannabis use ( within the last year ) increases with falls in income per capita regardless of age , although the increase is less marked for young people ( 14-24 years ).
R	Whereas the participation rate of people aged 25-49 years also falls with rising unemployment rates , the participation of younger people increases.
R	Cannabis users younger than 35 will use more frequently as the unemployment rate rises.
R	In contrast , older Australians will use less frequently.
C	Australia's recent economic slowdown has been characterised by rising unemployment rates without accompanying falls in income per capita.
C	Based on our findings this slowdown should have encouraged young Australians aged 14-24 years to both drink and use cannabis more frequently.
C	The slowdown would have had little impact on the frequency of drinking of older Australians.
C	However it should have discouraged older Australians from using cannabis , and encouraged people in their late 30s and 40s to use less frequently , whilst encouraging those aged 25-34 years to use more frequently.

B	Geosocial-networking smartphone applications ( apps ) have been used increasingly by men who have sex with men ( MSM ) to meet new sexual partners.
B	The purpose of this study was to examine associations between contexts of app use ( e.g. using apps when drinking ) and condomless anal intercourse among a sample of MSM who use these apps.
M	MSM ( n = 174 ) in New York City were recruited through Grindr , a geosocial-networking app popular among MSM , using broadcast advertisements asking MSM to complete an Internet-based survey about their app use and sexual behaviours.
M	Log-binomial regression models were fit to assess the association between each of the six app-use contexts ( e.g. using apps when lonely , when drinking ) and engagement in condomless insertive and receptive anal intercourse with one or more partners in the past 3 months.
R	Engagement in condomless receptive and insertive anal intercourse with one or more partners in the preceding 3 months was common ( 39.7% and 43.1% respectively ) and was associated with several app-use contexts.
R	For example , significant associations ( P < 0.05 ) were observed between alcohol and other drug use when using these apps and engagement in condomless receptive and insertive anal intercourse.
C	Given that 57.5% of respondents had engaged in condomless anal intercourse in the preceding 3 months and the associations of app-use contexts with condomless sexual behaviours , these findings suggest that reductions in substance use may lead to safer sexual practices among MSM who use apps to meet sexual partners.
B	Disruptive behavioral disorders ( DBD ) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are both characterized by certain patterns of misbehavior among adolescents.
P	The aim of this study was to examine how the comorbidity of DBD and ADHD affects in misbehavior among adolescents.
M	A total of 158 adolescents aged 16-18 years , from a subsample of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 ( NFBC 1986 ) , were interviewed with the Finnish translation of the semi-structured Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime ( K-SADS-PL ) in order to obtain DBD , including conduct disorder ( CD ) and oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) , and ADHD diagnoses.
M	The structure of the CD symptoms , obtained from the K-SADS-PL , was compared with the previously formed model about the development of the problematic behavior.
M	The severity of the CD symptoms was compared with adolescents diagnosed with only DBD , only ADHD and with both DBD and ADHD.
M	Also , the associations with other psychiatric disorders diagnosed at age 16 were evaluated.
R	The boys in the study sample were diagnosed with ADHD or with comorbid DBD and ADHD more often than girls.
R	The severity of CD symptoms was statistically significantly associated with the comorbid DBD and ADHD group.
R	The adolescents diagnosed with comorbid DBD and ADHD had an increased risk for anxiety disorders , depressive disorders and substance abuse disorders.
C	The comorbidity of DBD and ADHD seems to indicate the severity of CD symptoms.
C	The comorbidity between DBD and ADHD should be considered in clinical practice because it could indicate more serious problematic behavior than pure disorders alone.
