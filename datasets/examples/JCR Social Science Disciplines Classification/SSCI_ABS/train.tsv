Law	"This article analyses the important connection between corporate longevity, social responsibility and intellectual property rights (IPR) assets in the context of sustainability. Society is demanding greater transparency of the footprint corporate entities leave on the planet as a result of how their business model is activated. The private sector response necessary to operate sustainably in the long term is critically examined specifically in connection with the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9). SDG 9 aims to ""Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation"". Certain characteristics of companies in the century club are contrasted with those of the younger MNEs with IP-reliant digital business models to illustrate the important connection between innovation, IP, sustainability and corporate longevity."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"The main purpose of this research was to analyse the effects of the social structure on unequal patterns of morbidity and mortality in Portugal. The data source was based on the analysis of individual clinical files of inpatients from two hospitals who died in 2004 (N = 1935). Data were collected from these files on social and health dimensions so as to define each person's social class, health-related lifestyle, life trajectory and illness trajectories A theoretical framework inspired by Cockerham and Bourdieu's concepts as well as both multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were used to visualise the complex multidimensional social space of this health inequality field. The results show that over the life course, individuals positioned in different social classes experience distinct health and disease trajectories. The unequal distribution of the diseases and the causes of death in the social space reveal a structure of social inequalities based on the differentiated possibilities of accessing and using health resources.

Ethics	"This article introduces comparative process tracing (CPT) as a two-step methodological approach that combines theory, chronology, and comparison. For each studied case, the processes leading from A to B are reconstructed and analyzed in terms of ideal-type social mechanisms and then compared by making use of the identified mechanisms and ideal-type periodization. Central elements of CPT are path dependence, critical junctures and focal points, social mechanisms, context, periodization, and counterfactual analysis. The CPT approach is described, discussed, and compared with more formal and deterministic forms of process tracing, which are found to be less fruitful for systematic comparison."
Linguistics	"This article examines the Greek particle ba in naturally occurring talk, adopting a conversation analytic perspective. The analysis reveals that it is systematically involved in two different types of social action, depending on prosodic variation and sequential position. Overall, ba appears as either a repair initiator expressing surprise, or a negative token in polar answers and disagreements. It is shown that these seemingly different uses are united by an indexical anchor of unexpectedness that is realized differently prosodically and adopts an either backward- or forward-looking orientation. The article gives further insight into how one""s knowledge is related to one""s expectations, thus contributing to a better understanding of the epistemics of (un)expectedness. It also enriches growing cross-linguistic literature on epistemic particles from a Greek perspective. Data are drawn from 40 recorded ordinary conversations included in the Corpus of Spoken Greek and 8 focus groups conducted in Greece. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Women'S Studies	"I distinguish between two senses in which feminists have argued that the knower is social: 1. situated or socially positioned and 2. interdependent. I argue that these two aspects of the knower work in cooperation with each other in a way that can produce willful hermeneutical ignorance, a type of epistemic injustice absent from Miranda Fricker's Epistemic Injustice. Analyzing the limitations of Fricker's analysis of the trial of Tom Robinson in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird with attention to the way in which situatedness and interdependence work in tandem, I develop an understanding of willful hermeneutical ignorance, which occurs when dominantly situated knowers refuse to acknowledge epistemic tools developed from the experienced world of those situated marginally. Such refusals allow dominantly situated knowers to misunderstand, misinterpret, and/or ignore whole parts of the world."
Health Policy & Services	"Background. Incidents and quality problems are a prime cause why health care leaders are calling to redesign health care delivery One of the concepts used is lean thinking. Yet, lean often leads to resistance. Also, there is a lack of high quality evidence supporting lean premises. In this paper, we present an overview of lean thinking and its application to health care. Development, theory and application of lean thinking to health care. Lean thinking evolved from a tool designed to improve operational shop-floor performance at an automotive manufacturer to a management approach with both operational and sociotechnical aspects. Sociotechnical dynamics have until recently not received much attention. At the same time a balanced approach might lead to a situation where operational and sociotechnial improvements are mutually reinforcing. Application to health care has been limited and focussed mainly on operational aspects using original lean tools. A more integrative approach would be to pay more attention to sociotechnical dynamics of lean implementation efforts. Also, the need to use the original lean tools may be limited, because health care may have different instruments and tools already in use that are in line with lean thinking principles. Discussion. We believe lean thinking has the potential to improve health care delivery. At the same time, there are methodological and practical considerations that need to be taken into account. Otherwise, lean implementation will be superficial and fail, adding to existing resistance and making it more difficult to improve health care in the long term."
Anthropology	"This paper examines variables useful in reconstructing oral (caries, antemortem tooth loss, alveolar defects) and physiological (cribra orbitalia, linear enamel hypoplasia) well-being in two bioarchaeological assemblages from Hokkaido, Japan: Okhotsk (n = 37 individuals) and Jomon (n = 60). Findings are compared and contrasted with each other, with published series from Honshu Japan, and samples from climatically near-equivalent Alaska. It was found that more meaningful comparisons of Hokkaido paleohealth could be made with Alaskan material, rather than the more southerly Jomon. Results were ambiguous with respect to physiological well-being. Low levels of LEH in the cold-adapted samples suggest operating in arctic and subarctic environments with marine-based subsistence regimes is not physiologically expensive. However, the relatively high suggest the picture is not straightforward: the reasons for elevated cribra orbitalia in Hokkaido are unclear. The subarctic and arctic samples formed three broadly similar groupings in terms of oral health profiles: (1) Aleuts and Eskimo; (2) Ipiutak and Tigara; (3) Hokkaido Jomon, Okhotsk, and Kodiak Island. Differences between these groupings could be explained with a combination of sample demographics and subsistence orientations. The extremely high frequency of caries in one sample, caribou hunting Ipiutak, may have been influenced by factors such as low levels of dietary magnesium and potentially cariogenic foodstuffs, such as. preparations of caribou stomach contents. It was concluded that oral health profiles are potentially sensitive to differences in subsistence strategies among cold-adapted hunter-gatherers, although they lack predictive value."
Ethnic Studies	"Drawing upon ethnographic data collected in Glendale, California, this study applies constructivist theories of ethnic politics to political incorporation research. The analysis demonstrates how the evolving loci of political incorporation-from marginalized racial minorities in urban centers to multi-ethnic migrants in prosperous suburbs-have given rise to new agents (ethnopolitical entrepreneurs) in new spaces (ethnoburbs). In these evolving spaces, community leaders emphasize, consciously and unconsciously, specific attributes, which determine, in part, whether co-ethnics support selected candidates. Specific emphases lead to both the nomination of prospective politicians as well as the political incorporation of newcomers. By applying constructivist theories of ethnic politics to the study of political incorporation, this article expands and refines discourses in both fields of study. Based upon a case study of the intra-ethnically diverse yet highly mobilized Armenian community in Glendale, California, the paper's findings synthesize the strengths of both analytical perspectives."
Nursing	"Clinical skills training is an important part of nurses' education programmes. Clinical skills are complex. A common understanding of what characterizes clinical skills and learning outcomes needs to be established. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a new reflection and feedback tool for formative assessment. The study has a descriptive quantitative design. 129 students participated who were at the end of the first year of a Bachelor degree in nursing. After highfidelity simulation, data were collected using a questionnaire with 19 closed-ended and 2 open-ended questions. The tool stimulated peer assessment, and enabled students to be more thorough in what to assess as an observer in clinical skills. The tool provided a structure for selfassessment and made visible items that are important to be aware of in clinical skills. Conclusions: This article adds to simulation literature and provides a tool that is useful in enhancing peer learning, which is essential for nurses in practice. The tool has potential for enabling students to learn about reflection and developing skills for guiding others in practice after they have graduated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Demography	"This article investigates whether and how having a child impacts an individual's subjective well-being, while taking into account heterogeneity in family attitudes. People with different family orientations have different values, gender attitudes, preferences toward career and family, and expectations about how childbearing can affect their subjective well-being. These differences impact fertility decisions and the effect of parenthood on an individual's life satisfaction. We define three groups of people based on their family orientations: Traditional, Mixed, and Modern. Applying propensity score matching on longitudinal data (British Household Panel Survey), we create groups of individuals with very similar socioeconomic characteristics and family orientations before childbearing. We then compare those who have one child with those who are childless, and those who have two children with those who have only one child. We show that parents are significantly more satisfied than nonparents, and this effect is stronger among men than among women. For men, we do not find significant differences across family orientations groups in the effect of the birth of the first child on life satisfaction. Among women, only Traditional mothers seem to be more satisfied than their childless counterparts. Women who have a second child are never more satisfied than those who have only one child, regardless of their family orientations. Traditional and Mixed men experience a gain in life satisfaction when they have a second child, but this effect is not found for Modern men."
Gerontology	"This study examined how patients experience transitions to community from hospitals, inclusive of daily living problems and medical concerns. Analysing qualitative data from interviews with 36 individuals including 17 high-risk older adults with multiple chronic health conditions recently discharged from hospital, and 19 family members who provided the patients with ongoing care, we asked (1) What are the challenges that patients experience in transitioning home from the hospital, and (2) What are the system and policy solutions that can address the challenges these patients experience? Our findings reveal both short-and long-term challenges associated with transitions back home. Short-term challenges include preparing the dwelling for the patient and understanding the organization of care at home. Long-term challenges are associated with practical and emotional concerns. Reflecting on our findings, we suggest that patients' social needs may be equally important to their medical needs during post-discharge recovery, and we discuss implications for policy."
Sociology	"A core claim of sociological theory is that modern institutions fall short of their meritocratic ideals, whereby rewards should be allocated based on achievement-related criteria. Instead, high-status actors often experience a ""status advantage"": they are rewarded disproportionately to the quality of their performance. We develop and test a theory of status advantage in meritocratic settings. The most influential model in past research derives status advantage from decision-makers' tendency to infer quality from status when quality is uncertain. The theory developed here integrates and extends this and other theories to explain the emergence of status advantage in the many meritocratic contexts where the decision-maker's personal, first-order sense of quality is less important to the decision. We argue that in such contexts, decision-makers must often coordinate with others to make the ""best"" decision, and thus they focus on the ""third-order inference"" problem of discerning who or what ""most people"" think is higher quality, as encoded in status beliefs. Three experiments demonstrate that under such conditions, status advantages can emerge even though (1) status information does not resolve uncertainty about quality; (2) the status belief is illegitimate; and (3) no party to the decision personally prefers the higher-status option. The theory implies that status hierarchies are resilient in the face of significant dissent but may be subject to public challenge."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Franchise jobs are often viewed as epitomizing a ""low-road"" employee-management approach characterized by high turnover and several practices that are deemed unsophisticated, such as low investment in training, deskilling of work, and little encouragement of employee involvement. Research on franchise operations suggests, however, that the basic operating principles and practices of franchises tend to be more sophisticated than those of equivalent independent operators. Might their employee management practices be more advanced as well, notwithstanding the stereotype of franchise jobs? This study uses data from a national probability sample of establishments, drawn from surveys conducted in the mid-1990s, to examine the relationship between franchise status and employment practices. Descriptive statistics suggest that franchise operations used low-road practices, but once industry, size, and other control variables are included in the analysis, these operations appear to have offered better jobs with more sophisticated systems of employee management than did similar non-franchise operations."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Nephropathia epidemica (NE), an emerging rodent-borne viral disease, has become the most important cause of infectious acute renal failure in Belgium, with sharp increases in incidence occurring for more than a decade. Bank voles are the rodent reservoir of the responsible hantavirus and are known to display cyclic population peaks. We tried to relate these peaks to the cyclic NE outbreaks observed since 1993. Our hypothesis was that the ecological causal connection was the staple food source for voles, being seeds of deciduous broad-leaf trees, commonly called ""mast"". We also examined whether past temperature and precipitation preceding ""mast years"" were statistically linked to these NE outbreaks. Results: Since 1993, each NE peak is immediately preceded by a mast year, resulting in significantly higher NE case numbers during these peaks (Spearman R = -0.82; P = 0.034). NE peaks are significantly related to warmer autumns the year before (R = 0.51; P < 0.001), hotter summers two years before (R = 0.32; P < 0.001), but also to colder (R = -0.25; P < 0.01) and more moist summers (R = 0.39; P < 0.001) three years before. Summer correlations were even more pronounced, when only July was singled out as the most representative summer month. Conclusion: NE peaks in year 0 are induced by abundant mast formation in year-1, facilitating bank vole survival during winter, thus putting the local human population at risk from the spring onwards of year 0. This bank vole survival is further promoted by higher autumn temperatures in year-1, whereas mast formation itself is primed by higher summer temperatures in year-2. Both summer and autumn temperatures have been rising to significantly higher levels during recent years, explaining the virtually continuous epidemic state since 2005 of a zoonosis, considered rare until recently. Moreover, in 2007 a NE peak and an abundant mast formation occurred for the first time within the same year, thus forecasting yet another record NE incidence for 2008. We therefore predict that with the anticipated climate changes due to global warming, NE might become a highly endemic disease in Belgium and surrounding countries."
Development Studies	"This paper examines whether an effective state-business relationship, facilitated by an organised private sector, improves firm performance in seven sub-Saharan African countries: Benin, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, South Africa and Zambia. The findings reveal that, on average, state-business relationships enhance firm productivity by about 25-35 per cent in sub-Saharan African firms. This effect appears to set in through an improved investment climate-including reduced corruption, better provision of public utilities and information technology development-and higher labour productivity. These gains are not confined to small and medium sized firms but have a similar positive impact on large firms. Further, both domestic and foreign-owned firms appear to benefit from joining business associations, although the impact is somewhat larger for the latter. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Geography	"There has been a very welcome recent growth in research directly with and by children and young people, with a wide range of reporting children's own views and experiences. Research ethics has also recently been receiving a great deal of attention, and there are debates about the extent to which research with children differs from research with other groups. This paper draws on the author's experiences of empirical sociological research with 12-15-year-olds conducted in a deprived town in SE England in the late 1990s that explored children and young people's social networks and neighbourhoods, and the implications for their health and wellbeing (social capital). The paper focuses on some ethical dilemmas raised during the research, and concludes with a discussion of broader issues related to dissemination and the policy implications of research"
Economics	"What happens in the developing world when stringent regulations characterizing the investment climate meet weak government willingness or capability to enforce those regulations? How is business actually done? The Doing Business project surveys experts concerning the legally required time and costs of regulatory compliance for various aspects of private enterprise-starting a firm, dealing with construction permits, trading across borders, paying taxes, getting credit, enforcing contracts, and so on-around the world. The World Bank's firm-level Enterprise Surveys around the world ask managers at a wide array of firms about their business, including questions about how long it took to go through various processes like obtaining an operating license or a construction permit, or bringing in imports. This paper compares the results of three broadly comparable indicators from the Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys. Overall, we find that the estimate of legally required time for firms to complete a certain legal and regulatory process provided by the Doing Business survey does not summarize even modestly well the experience of firms as reported by the Enterprise Surveys. When strict de jure regulation and high rates of taxation meet weak governmental capabilities for implementation and enforcement, we argue that researchers and policymakers should stop thinking about regulations as creating ""rules"" to be followed, but rather as creating a space in which ""deals"" of various kinds are possible."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: In anticipation of patient surge due to COVID-19, many states are working to increase the available healthcare workforce. To help inform state policies and initiatives aimed at physician deployment during COVID-19, we used predictions of peak patient volume for hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) and regional physician workforce estimates to measure patient to physician ratios at the peak of the pandemic for each state. Methods: We estimated the number of potentially available physicians based on Medicare Part B billings for the care of hospitalized and critically ill patients in 2017, adjusted for attrition due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and relevant experience. We used estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to determine the number of hospitalized and ICU patients expected at the peak of the pandemic in each state. We then determined the expected ratio of patients per physician for each state at the peak of the pandemic. Results: The median number of hospitalized patients per physician was 13 (low estimate) to 18 (high estimate). At the high estimate of hospitalized patients, 35 states would have a patient to physician ratio of more than 15:1 (patient to physician ratios above 15:1 have been associated with poor outcomes). For ICU patients, the median number of patients each physician would treat across states would be 8-11 patients. Nine states would experience patient to physician ratios above 15:1 at the higher end of estimates. Patient-physician ratios decreased if the available physician pool was broadened to include physicians without recent experience treating hospitalized patients, and physicians in surgical specialties with experience treating acutely hospitalized patients. Conclusions/implications: We estimate that most states will have sufficient physician capacity to manage hospitalized patients at the peak of the pandemic. However, at the high estimates of hospitalized patients, some Midwestern states will experience high patient to provider ratios that may adversely affect patient outcomes."
Information Science & Library Science	"Pragmatic clinical trials often entail the use of electronic health record (EHR) and claims data, but bias and quality issues associated with these data can limit their fitness for research purposes particularly for study end points. Patient-reported health (PRH) data can be used to confirm or supplement EHR and claims data in pragmatic trials, but these data can bring their own biases. Moreover, PRH data can complicate analyses if they are discordant with other sources. Using experience in the design and conduct of multi-site pragmatic trials, we itemize the strengths and limitations of PRH data and identify situational criteria for determining when PRH data are appropriate or ideal to fill gaps in the evidence collected from EHRs. To provide guidance for the scientific rationale and appropriate use of patient-reported data in pragmatic clinical trials, we describe approaches for ascertaining and classifying study end points and addressing issues of incomplete data, data alignment, and concordance. We conclude by identifying areas that require more research."
Social Work	"The Labour Government in the UK has announced, as part of its launch of The Children's Plan, that it 'wants to make this country the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up' in. This latest Plan is further evidence of the surge of interest that there has been in children (and, in particular, early childhood) over the last ten years in the UK and indeed elsewhere. Many of the recent policy and practice initiatives have implications for social workers working with young children. Yet, social work as a profession, in comparison with education, has remained relatively silent on these initiatives and it is hard to find any critical analysis of these developments in terms of either their underlying discourses or their implications for social workers. This article sets out to address these gaps by providing a critical analysis of: what types of knowledge regarding the early years have gained political currency; why and how this is the case; and what the implications are for the role and practices of social workers. The article proposes that discourses of 'need' and 'provision' mask more powerful discourses of economics, social control and risk avoidance, and it concludes by advocating more critically reflexive social work practice with young children and their families."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"This paper presents a new algorithm to solve the one-dimensional optimal stratification problem, which reduces to just determining stratum boundaries. When the number of strata H and the total sample size n are fixed, the stratum boundaries are obtained by minimizing the variance of the estimator of a total for the stratification variable. This algorithm uses the Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) metaheuristic to search for the optimal solution. This metaheuristic has been shown to produce good quality solutions for many optimization problems in modest computing times. The algorithm is implemented in the R package stratbr available from CRAN (de Moura Brito, do Nascimento Silva and da Veiga, 2017a). Numerical results are provided for a set of 27 populations, enabling comparison of the new algorithm with some competing approaches available in the literature. The algorithm outperforms simpler approximation-based approaches as well as a couple of other optimization-based approaches. It also matches the performance of the best available optimization-based approach due to Kozak (2004). Its main advantage over Kozak's approach is the coupling of the optimal stratification with the optimal allocation proposed by de Moura Brito, do Nascimento Silva, Silva Semaan and Maculan (2015), thus ensuring that if the stratification bounds obtained achieve the global optimal, then the overall solution will be the global optimum for the stratification bounds and sample allocation."
Demography	"Sri Lanka is the fastest ageing South Asian population. Using data from the Sri Lanka Aging Survey 2006, this paper documents the health of adult child caregivers and their elderly parents, nature of care provided, areas of caregiver concern, factors associated with caregiver stress, and caregiver attitudes towards elder care. Adult children (n = 381), defining themselves as the elderly parent's primary caregiver, and their elderly parents (n = 430), constitute the sample for this analysis. Relatively poor health among elderly parents combined with substantial time required for care-giving, and a relatively high level of stress among caregivers, is observed. Gender differences are observed in the type of elder care provided, and in the risk of being stressed/worried. Most caregivers have favourable attitudes towards home-based care, negative attitudes towards institutional care, and expect support from their children in old age. Caregiver burden will increasingly become a policy concern given Sri Lanka's ageing population and the predominant expectation that eldercare is the children's responsibility."
Ethics	"The past is full of terrible tragedies, including slavery, World War I, and the Holocaust. Morality would clearly appear to support the preference that the victims of those calamities would have lived free and peaceful lives. And yet, a puzzle or even a paradox appears to be lurking here. Moral evaluation can be either personal or impersonal, yet neither one of these two perspectives, nor any other prevalent moral evaluation of events, appears to yield the morally expected conclusion. To the best of my knowledge this puzzle has not been discussed before. If there is no way to escape this surprising conclusion, then morality appears to be much more grim and unsympathetic than we normally think."
Management	"The twin-screw configuration problem arises during polymer extrusion and compounding. It consists in defining the location of a set of pre-defined screw elements along the screw axis in order to optimize different, typically conflicting objectives. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective stochastic local search (SLS) algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm is based on efficient single-objective iterative improvement algorithms, which have been developed by studying different neighborhood structures, neighborhood search strategies, and neighborhood restrictions. These algorithms are embedded into a variation of the two-phase local search framework to tackle various bi-objective versions of this problem. An experimental comparison with a previously proposed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm shows that a main advantage of our SLS algorithm is that it converges faster to a high-quality approximation to the Pareto front."
"Education, Special"	"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of a system of least prompts procedure and use of a graphic organizer to teach the academic literacy standard of comparing characters in text for elementary students with moderate and severe intellectual disability. A multiple probe across participants design was used to evaluate the results. The results indicated the system of least prompts and graphic organizer intervention was effective in teaching the skill to one student. The intervention, with modifications, was effective for two additional students. All participants maintained and generalized the skill. Directions for future research and practical implications are discussed."
Social Issues	"Recent climate change statistics attribute over a quarter of carbon emissions to residential energy use in the United Kingdom. To address this, a building standard (Code for Sustainable Homes) was introduced to aim to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption. This paper analyzes how such an environmental standard reconfigures the sociotechnological relations and practices of housing professionals that design, construct, and manage social housing. We focus on how actors engage with the standard's recommendation for incorporating low and zero carbon technologies into new buildings. We identify diverse practices that emerge from these engagements, which, we contend, have significant consequences for the working relationships of professional actors and for renewable energy provision. By being entwined in, and generative of actors' practices, we argue that the Code becomes part of the sociotechnological relationships and infrastructures that shape energy provision."
Economics	"The paper proves the existence of equilibrium in non-renewable resource markets when extraction costs are non-convex and resource storage is possible. Inventories flatten the consumption path and eliminate price jumps at the end of the extraction period, so that market equilibrium becomes possible. We distinguish between two types of solutions, one with immediate and one with delayed buildup of inventories. For both cases, we do not only characterize potential optimal paths but also show that equilibria actually exist under fairly general conditions. It is found that optimum resource extraction involves increasing quantities over a period of time. What is generally interpreted as an indicator of increasing resource abundance is thus perfectly compatible with constant resource stocks."
Law	"Judicial federalism scholarship has concentrated on the interplay between the U.S. Supreme Court and state supreme courts for incorporated rights, where the former sets the floor for rights in the states. But little has been said about judicial federalism and the unincorporated rights, where states are unrestricted in their freedom to define the rights. The Seventh Amendment presents a one-of-a-kind experiment in judicial federalism, as the only federal constitutional right that is duplicated in the great majority of state constitutions and has generated an appreciable body of case law. In this Note, I analyze the evolution of state court treatment of the intertwined-issues problem, both before Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover announced the federal rule, and today. Surprisingly, I reveal first, a genuine split of authority in the states between the Beacon Theatres rule and a narrower rule, and second, that the states had nearly uniformly agreed to the narrower rule before Beacon Theatres a fact not discussed by the Beacon Theatres Court or litigants. The Beacon Theatres decision has transformed the doctrinal landscape over more than fifty years; many state courts have uprooted their state rules and planted the federal rule in its place. This Note concludes that state supreme courts need a distinct approach for unincorporated rights, such as the Seventh Amendment, to serve judicial federalism norms."
Political Science	"While the party decides theory explains the outcomes of past nomination battles for president, this year in the Republican presidential contest party insiders failed to anoint a standard bearer. Who decides when the party elites don't? In 2016, it was America's authoritarian voters. And their candidate of choice, Donald Trump, is anathema to party leaders. I argue that Trump's rise is in part the result of authoritarian voters' response to his unvarnished, us-versus-them rhetoric. The failure of Republican Party insiders to coalesce behind one candidate opened the door for Trump. Authoritarian-driven partisan polarization (Hetherington and Weiler 2009), increasing fear of real and imagined threats, and terrorist incidents abroad and at home provided the fuel for Trump's campaign. And Trump's message and manner ignited that fuel, propelling him to the Republican nomination for president."
Criminology & Penology	"This article explores the definition of forgiveness from the perspective of individuals who have lost loved ones to homicide. This article draws on 33 in-depth, semistructured interviews that asked participants to define and discuss forgiveness and non-forgiveness both in general and as it relates to homicide. Analysis shows three distinct definitions of, or orientations toward, forgiveness, each learned through interaction with family and/or religion: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal. Analyses suggest that future investigations must include multiple definitions of forgiveness, and victim services must be cognizant of these various pathways toward forgiveness."
Women'S Studies	"This essay examines women's spectacularly visible status in feminised mass cultural domains in the first decades of the twentieth century. Feminine spectacles are commonly understood to invite viewers to access women's bodies, yet early twentieth-century spectacles paradoxically called renewed attention to women's illegibility. Women's visual prominence made apparent their 'unknowability', recasting an ancient ideational heritage in modern terms. Representations of women as opaque in the early twentieth century constituted a challenge to ocularcentrism and reveal the centrality of femininity in mass mediations of epistemology and ontology. Drawing on written accounts of women's opacity in the fashion and beauty press, I argue that attention to spectacles of unknowability can be productive for feminist modernist studies. The texturing of histories of feminine spectacle challenges some tenacious dichotomies that continue to inform accounts of women's place in the modern, including those of subject and object, and visibility and invisibility. Focusing on opacity leads us to a productive account of the variable visibility of women in the modern, which foregrounds the multiple historical relations of different groups of women to regimes of visibility and keeps in view the diverse ways that differently classed and raced women were positioned vis-a-vis spectacle. The essay draws on feminist and postcolonial theory to suggest that an attunement to the unknowable not only nuances our understanding of a discrete historical period, but can lead the feminist researcher to confront and expand her own gaze in the era of capitalist modernity."
Public Administration	"This article reviews and synthesizes diverse streams of literature to assess the potential of deliberative democracy for American public administration. It asserts that the field should refocus its attention on the role of citizens in the work of government to help address the pervasive citizenship and democratic deficits in the United States. American public administration has an obligation to address these deficits because (a) it is required to do so by democratic ethos, (b) it has contributed to the deficits with its widespread embrace of bureaucratic ethos, and (c) it must find ways to effectively engage citizens within modern network and collaborative governance structures. This article identifies deliberative democracy as one potential method to help fulfill these obligations and explains how deliberative processes may help address the deficit problems. The article concludes by identifying a preliminary research agenda for exploring the potential of deliberative democracy for public administration."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Survey Research Methods has slightly revised its publication policies. Firstly, starting with the publication of this Editorial, SRM will accept - under specified conditions - manuscripts that discuss experiments in non-probability samples for peer-review. Secondly, SRM will require authors to publish replication materials of their study as Online supplement to their article. Finally, Survey Research Methods will publish replication studies of articles published in the journal. This Editorial gives reasons for these changes."
Linguistics	"This study examines pitch range production in the read speech of female German second language (L2) learners of English of moderate to advanced proficiency. The study set out to identify to what extent the learners deviated from or adopted the language-appropriate pitch range values of the target language. Two potential ways in which the learners could deviate from or approximate the target were recognized: (a) by globally expanding their pitch range or (b) by adjusting their pitch range in a position-sensitive way that is linked to the phonetic realization patterns of underlying high and low tones at different points in intonation contours. Results showed that the L2 speakers produced pitch range values that were often language appropriate or approximated the target, although some deviations from the target were also identified. Deviations and target approximation were found to be position sensitive; that is, L2 learners were found to adjust their pitch range differently at the beginning as compared to later parts of intonational phrases."
Anthropology	"A veritable gold rush of oil and gas exploration and export development is washing along the coast of western Canada. This paper explores the contemporary setting and possibilities for collaborative research with Indigenous communities in the face of large-scale corporate interventions and the history of colonization. Drawing upon two decades of research and close collaboration with Indigenous communities on the North Coast of British Columbia, Menzies (himself an Indigenous scholar) argues that collaborative anthropology is both more necessary and more difficult than at almost any previous point in our history."
International Relations	"This article draws on official sources to investigate how New Zealand interpreted its Women, Peace and Security obligations through the development and implementation of its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015. Existing beliefs that New Zealand was already a 'world leader' in this field yielded an unambitious document. Government agencies such as the New Zealand Police (NZ Police) and New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) have gone on to make some gains under the narrow remit of the NAP, but resourcing and accountability are lacking. Moreover, this focus on perceived existing strengths, and the drawing of objectives from these, meant that New Zealand missed an opportunity to initiate the kind of deeper structural changes initially envisaged by WPS advocates. This article therefore closes with a discussion of how two broader processes - 're-gendering' and 'de-othering' - could help New Zealand to better serve the original intent of the WPS agenda."
Social Work	"In Sweden, unaccompanied youths are placed within residential care units. However, to settle in a foreign country and feel emotional belonging is more complex than access to a physical building. The aim of this study is to critically discuss the concept of 'home' as experienced by the youths, narrated in nine focus group interviews. These interviews occurred in the aftermath of a turbulent migration time (2015), when over 35,000 unaccompanied youths arrived in Sweden. A transnational theoretical perspective stretches the meaning across national borders, when home links to people, processes and other geographical places. It is difficult to create an environment that mirrors the emotional attachment described in analysis. Earlier research has shown that residential care workers refer to the institutional setting as home, yet the results of this study show that the young people relate to the concept differently. Staff utilisation of the concept of home rather emphasises the lack of home-like aspects for the youths, creating a frustration in the current institutional conditions. Staff in residential care units must therefore be aware of the different interpretations and reactions that their actions and communications generate, in order to respond to various needs."
Ethnic Studies	"In recent years, the use of typologies of national models of integration to analyse and understand immigrant integration politics, policy or processes has become contentious. The approach has received a good share of criticism for offering stereotypical, inaccurate or too simplistic descriptions of how countries approach immigrant integration. According to critics, the approach lacks a clear definition and operationalization of the national model concept, it ignores internal variation, it is unable to account for change and, finally, it lacks a theory of action regarding how ideas affect policies. This paper responds to all these four criticisms but from the perspective of an ideational understanding of the national models approach. However, first, the paper distinguishes different kinds of national model approaches in order to offer a precise definition of the ideational approach it develops."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"This essay analyzes how academic institutions, government agencies, and the nascent biotech industry contested the legal ownership of recombinant DNA technology in the name of the public interest. It reconstructs the way a small but influential group of government officials and university research administrators introduced a new framework for the commercialization of academic research in the context of a national debate over scientific research's contributions to American economic prosperity and public health. They claimed that private ownership of inventions arising from public support would provide a powerful means to liberate biomedical discoveries for public benefit. This articulation of the causal link between private ownership and the public interest, it is argued, justified a new set of expectations about the use of research results arising from government or public support, in which commercialization became a new public obligation for academic researchers. By highlighting the broader economic and legal shifts that prompted the reconfiguration of the ownership of public knowledge in late twentieth-century American capitalism, the essay examines the threads of policy-informed legal ideas that came together to affirm private ownership of biomedical knowledge as germane to the public interest in the coming of age of biotechnology and genetic medicine."
Communication	"When hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in the summer of 2011, protesting the high cost of living and demanding ""social justice,"" the ills of the media system including its concentration, the growing digital divide, and the implosion of public broadcasting were not made part of the social movement's agenda. This study employs a justice-based theory for media, analyzing three types of ""products"" of the social movement: the unionization of media workers, the establishment of alternative media, and the reports recommending regulatory/institutional reform. We attempt to understand why media reform, an essential element without which social justice cannot be fully achieved, has been sidelined in the debate over the ways to achieve ""social justice"" in Israel."
Social Work	"This article extends what is known about the relationship between adolescent involvement in risk behavior and successful transition to adulthood by examining its influence on career readiness. Having goals and plans for the future has been linked to positive health and educational outcomes. However, there has been less research to understand the key determinants of career readiness. This study explores the association between youth involvement in multiple risk behaviors and career readiness. One hundred twenty-five primarily urban African American youths were asked about their involvement with risk behaviors, including violence, drug, and alcohol use, and their career readiness. Structural equation models were estimated in Mplus 6.0. Controlling for academic achievement, the latent variable for violence involvement was significantly negatively related to career readiness (-.73, p < .05). In contrast, the latent variable for involvement with drugs and alcohol was not significantly related to adolescents' career readiness. This finding supports literature demonstrating that adolescents involved in violence may hold more fatalistic views about their life chances. It supports the importance of interventions for youths involved in violence that help them prepare for their future, perhaps by exposing them to positive role models, opportunities, and careers."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"The United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has the responsibility of quantifying the nation's agricultural production. Historically, it has focused on large production agriculture. With interest and activity increasing in urban areas, NASS has begun exploring how to better quantify urban agriculture. This segment of agriculture is particularly challenging to enumerate because the agricultural holdings tend to be small, diverse, widely dispersed, and more transient than the predominantly large farms in rural areas. In collaboration with the Multi-Agency Collaboration Environment (MACE), a new approach to list building was explored in a pilot study conducted in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. Using a big data approach, areas of potential agricultural activity were identified by gathering information (state and local permits, Facebook and twitter feeds, interest groups, etc.) via the web. A sample was drawn from the list, and an in-person survey was conducted to assess whether or not the identified areas had agricultural activity. The results of the pilot study are presented. Lessons learned from the study and next steps are discussed."
Political Science	"During the last decade in many European Union countries it has clearly emerged that states with weak administrative capacity at the subnational level are more likely to have serious problems with the mismanagement of Structural Funds, or even with accessing them. As a result, some member states such as Italy have embarked upon a programme of institutional and administrative reforms aimed at increasing their administrative capacity. However, retrospective data shows that even though some regions have implemented all the required reforms, their performance has remained unchanged. Along with administrative requirements, are political conditions as such to guarantee that administrative capacity can produce the desired effects? What happens if we do not have political stability that allows for continuity and coherence in administrative actions? Political stability is a controversial variable and theories within the literature present ambiguous results. Some authors strongly claim that stability hinders performance because it fosters the practice of clientelism and the entrenchment of distributional coalitions. In contrast, I aim to explore whether and why, in some cases, stability is actually a variable that accounts for better and improved administrative performance."
Anthropology	"Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are a key food item and a totemic animal with major spiritual significance for Torres Strait Islanders of northeastern Australia. These marine mammals are officially classed vulnerable to extinction which has placed hunters under considerable internal (cultural) and external (bureaucratic) pressure to lower hunting rates dramatically to sustainable levels. But did Torres Strait Islanders hunt dugongs at much lower rates in the pre-colonial past? Excavation of a ritual dugong bone mound on Mabuyag island revealed the remains of 10,00011,000 dugongs hunted between c. 1600 and c. 1900AD. The translated hunting rate of 33-37 dugongs per year is surprisingly high and challenging as this single site represents one-third of what conservation biologists argue is the current mean sustainable hunting rate for the entire Torres Strait archipelago. These data suggest that dugong abundance was much higher in the pre-colonial past and that current hunting rates are uncharacteristically unsustainable primarily due to an unprecedented dugong population crash and not increased post-contact hunting rates.

Demography	"BACKGROUND One of the fundamental arguments sustaining the classical demographic transition theory was that couples wanted to have a given number of surviving children, not a specific number of births. However, this cornerstone of transition theory came in for severe criticism in the wake of the results published in many studies linked to the Princeton European Fertility Project (PEFP). In recent years, studies using longitudinal microdata have made important contributions towards clarifying the relationship between mortality and fertility during the transition. OBJECTIVE We will show that aggregated data (from both the national and the provincial sphere) can lead to conclusions similar to those obtained at micro-level. METHODS Employing information from 25 developed countries, this article analyzes trends in net reproduction (rather than just the intensity of births) over a long period of time. We also quantify in detail the different influences of marital fertility, mortality, and nuptiality on historical developments in net total reproduction. RESULTS Our analysis reveals a great diversity in the reproductive patterns followed in different countries in the process of regulating the total number of births. We also detect the existence of a nonhomogeneous effect of mortality on net reproduction during the demographic transition. CONCLUSIONS There is little point in analyzing fertility trends if we leave out the mortality scenario that forms the background to these tendencies. CONTRIBUTION The results of this study using aggregated data (covering longer periods of time and larger geographical areas) are fully in line with those of recent projects using microdata from family reconstructions."
Sociology	"The unusual Donald Trump's figure emergence on political podium looks as unforeseen only at first glance. In reality this is an unknown for many pattern, arising from radical changes in different countries of the world and in their mutual relations that took place during last decade and meaning the World Order fundamental change, the transition from unipolar to multipolar world. Plane and simple it couldn't not but affect US position in the world and in American domestic affairs. Voluntarily shoulding the burden of unique and exclusive World leader - the goal Americans had strived to achive since the founding of their state - turned to be unreachable. As follows from Trump's statements, he realizes the necessity to relieve some of the burden and to shift the center of efforts to America's internal modernisation that would be capable to prevent actual loss by this state of its superpower status. Yet natural failure of the triumph that had been celebrated by USA after USSR dissolution did not satisfy triumphalists. They are the some Democratic Party followers (not all of them) and neokons, deep state agents who are not ready to tolerate neither Russia's rebirth, nor Trump's victory and who in reality are waging paralel war both against Russia and Trump. Hence the Russiagate promotion to the fore at this war with accusations vs. President and his people for collaboration with Russia. All this is going on in an environment of the new cold war unforeseen neither for us, not for Americans that is much more dangerous for both countries and for all mankind then the old one. Further complicating factor is unpredictability and rugged style of Trump's governance. In any case, under this president and his leadership, the country has entered a state of deep internal crisis, at the same time instigating an external crisis primarily in American-Russian and American-Chinese relations."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This article uses the theory of path dependency to explain the evolution of employment conflict resolution systems in Ireland and Sweden. It argues that the traditional 'voluntarist' conflict management path followed in Ireland has fragmented as a result of a series of internal developments that have reduced trade union density, increased the importance of employment law in the settlement of workplace disputes and established social partnership as the main wage-setting mechanism. By contrast, the Swedish system has experienced reform within the boundaries of the established conflict management path, which is largely attributable to the still powerful role played by trade unions within the country. Thus, while the operating rules of the system have changed, its core underlying principles - collectivism and self-regulation - remain intact."
Substance Abuse	"Background: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]), commonly referred to as Molly in the US, is commonly adulterated with drugs potentially more dangerous than MDMA. Synthetic cathinones (""bath salts"") are common adulterants, and use of these compounds tends to be stigmatized. We investigated whether presenting information on the extent of ecstasy being adulterated with ""bath salts"" affects intentions to use. Methods: A total of 1,025 adults entering electronic dance music parties were surveyed in 2018. Using an experimental posttest-only design with random assignment, half were randomly assigned to view a published Vice headline about ecstasy/Molly commonly being adulterated with ""bath salts."" Results: Overall, 30.5% of the sample reported past-year ecstasy use, and before viewing the headline, 16.4% agreed that ecstasy/Molly commonly contains ""bath salts."" While controlling for pre-test knowledge of ""bath salt"" adulteration, viewing the headline reduced the odds of intention to use ecstasy/Molly only among non-past-year ecstasy users (Odd ratio [OR] = 0.54; p = .048). Viewing the headline increased the odds (OR = 1.81, p = .030) of past-year ecstasy users' intention to test their ecstasy for adulterants. Conclusions: Knowledge that ecstasy is commonly adulterated may help reduce the risk for future use among non-recent users and increase the willingness of users to test their ecstasy. This information can be used to target those at risk for ecstasy/Molly use."
Communication	"This article presents a secondary analysis of two multi-national cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2015 (11 countries, N = 10,570) and 2017 (4 countries, N = 2165) to examine the relationship between populist attitudes and media use. The results indicate that populist citizens are more likely to consume news than non-populist citizens. Specifically, populist citizens exhibit a preference for commercial television (TV) news, as well as a tendency to read tabloid newspapers. While they use fewer quality newspapers, public TV news are not systematically avoided. Regarding the online news environment, populist citizens prefer Facebook over Twitter as a source of political information. This selective pattern will be discussed in light of the debates on news audience polarization and political polarization."
Area Studies	"Historical analogies, and historical reasoning, enable policy-makers to overcome major fundamental difficulties in the process of crisis decision-making. By employing lessons and conclusions from past experience, leaders believe they can avoid future failures and make better choices. This paper identifies, for the first time, the key analogies David Ben-Gurion and other key Israeli policy-makers employed prior to the eruption of the Sinai War of October 1956 and their reasoning. It demonstrates that Ben-Gurion was highly sensitive to historical occurrences, personal, national and international, and exhibited great inclination to engage the crisis with Egypt according to the lessons he drew from it. The analogical framework explains the timing of the offensive against Egypt and its distinct nature."
Nursing	"Video-assisted debriefing (VAD) refers to using video capture and playback to support learning in debriefing. Despite being deemed as the gold standard in simulation, VAD has received little attention to its structure development. This paper aimed to describe the development process of a structured three-phase VAD and report its preliminary effects on nursing students"" debriefing experiences, reflective abilities, and professional competencies following a code blue simulation. This three-phase VAD was developed through an extensive literature review, and its pilot test was conducted at a tertiary university using the pretest-posttest design. A convenient sample of 63 prelicensure nursing students were used. Study outcomes were measured using the Debriefing Experience Scale (DES), the Groningen Reflective Ability Scale (GRAS), and the Simulation-based Assessment Tool (SAT). The preliminary findings of this study showed that the developed three-phase VAD demonstrated its potential on improving nursing students"" debriefing experiences (p < 0.001), reflective abilities (p < 0.01), and professional competencies (p < 0.001). Considering the limitations of the pilot design, a two-arm quasi-experimental study with a larger sample size will be conducted to further confirm its effectiveness on the context of nursing."
Family Studies	"This study explores the processes by which custodial mothers can support and inhibit fathers' relationships following divorce and separation. It draws on qualitative interviews with resident mothers and nonresident fathers from 54 separated families, including 22 sets of former couples. The study found that mothers adopt a range of strategies, from proactive gate opening to gate closing, and that these strategies appear influential. Maternal perceptions of paternal competence and child welfare beliefs, parental relationship quality, and parental role bargains were strongly linked to different types of maternal gatekeeping. Informed by systems theory, the interviews of former couples suggest that gate work, whether gate opening or gate closing, can be a dynamic transactional process rather than a linear and unidirectional process running from mothers to fathers."
History Of Social Sciences	"The aim of this paper is to compare and contrast modernist housing projects in Western and Eastern Blocs built in the period of accelerated urban growth that took place mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. The obvious starting point is that cities in the Eastern Bloc were different from Western cities because of the distinct nature of their urban policies, the centrally planned economy, the absence of a free land market, the impact of industrialization on building construction, etc. However, there are many concepts in urban planning and design, as well as urban processes and urban forms, shared by both ideological systems and that can be clearly recognized in housing estates from that period.This paper offers a comparative perspective of the nature of some of those modern Housing Estates built on both sides of the Iron Curtain such as Grands Ensembles in France, Gro ss siedlungen in Germany, Poligonos de viviendas in Spain, or Socialist Housing Estates equivalents in Eastern Bloc countries. The goal is to understand how mass housing forms were related to the modernist international urban culture of the Athens Charter and what was the role of urban design in the significant loss of environmental quality appreciable either in the West or in the East in those years of accelerated urban growth almost everywhere in Europe."
Social Work	"Standpoint theory identifies a power differential between a group in power and an oppressed group. Standpoint theories provide a theoretical framework to explore how oppressed groups experience their position, and help identify a way to challenge the group in power. Among the standpoint theories that have been posited, a Child Standpoint Theory has not been fully formed. In the development of a Child Standpoint Theory, there must be exploration to determine whether children are an oppressed group. This paper is broken into four sections in the consideration of a Child Standpoint Theory. The first section is a brief overview of the history of standpoint theory. The second provides a brief overview of the view of the child developmentally and socially. The third identifies possible tenets of Child Standpoint Theory. The final section explores the reasons for the development of, and reasons to consider, Child Standpoint Theory. In this article, children will be inclusive of all developmental ages through childhood and adolescence."
Area Studies	"This article offers an analytical introduction to some important Cuba-related discussions in China in the last two-and-a-half decades. No Latin American nation has been treated like Castros' (Fidel and Raul) Cuba in China's ideological development. Cuba's revolutionary experience in the past and the regime's defiance of major global trends - from retreat of socialism to advancement of neo-liberalism - correspond to a wide range of opinions in China and are exploited by them to address their own concerns. To borrow Orientalist analysis, just like the ""Other"" helps define ""Self,"" as a ""socialist Other,"" Cuba in Chinese perception often reflects China's own confusions and contradictions."
Education & Educational Research	"There has been a shift in the core idea of schooling in both Germany and Canada: While schools have traditionally focused on cognitive development, they now increasingly focus on engaged learners' and use integrated settings to support their cognitive, metacognitive and social-emotional development. In line with the theme Learning to Be', we argue that beliefs about the purpose of schooling are shifting from a narrow, knowledge-based approach to understanding that students need knowledge, skills and attitudes to succeed in their private, public and professional lives as adults. To this end, pedagogical concepts developed in alternative education are increasingly being implemented by mainstream schools. This article examines this significant development in Germany and Canada. We analyse current examples from mainstream schools, highlighting how they use alternative pedagogical concepts to transform the ways in which students come to know themselves as learners. In both countries, this process has been simultaneously bottom-up, driven by early-adopter schools, and top-down, driven by public awards or broad public initiatives."
Nursing	"The purpose of this study was to analyze the accuracy of the defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis of impaired swallowing in children with encephalopathy. The measures of diagnostic accuracy for each indicator were verified through latent class analysis. The prevalence of swallowing impairment was 59.76% for a total of 82 children evaluated. The defining characteristics that had good measures of sensitivity (range: 79.59-99.99) and specificity (range: 72.72-99.99) were as follows: food falls from the mouth, tongue action ineffective in forming bolus, prolonged bolus formation, inability to clear the oral cavity, and food refusal. Eight characteristics can be used as warning signs for impaired swallowing because they have high sensitivity values. In addition, ten characteristics presented high specificity and can be used to confirm this diagnosis in children with encephalopathy. Considering the findings of the swallowing pattern assessments through the analysis of the accuracy measures, it is verified that the evidence presented here should guide the pediatrics nurses in the diagnosis decision making. Indicators of high sensitivity should be used as warning signs for swallowing impairment, and the high specificity indicators should be used as a confirmatory sign of this condition and requires immediate intervention.

Law	"The federal statute known as the ""debt ceiling"" limits total borrowing by the United States. Congress has repeatedly raised the ceiling to authorize necessary borrowing, but a political standoff in 2011 nearly made it impossible to borrow funds to meet obligations that Congress had affirmed earlier that very year. Some commentators urged President Obama to ignore the debt ceiling, while others responded that such borrowing would violate the separation of powers and therefore that the president should refuse to spend appropriated funds. This Article analyzes the choice the president nearly faced in summer 2011, and which he or a successor may yet face, as a ""trilemma"" offering three unconstitutional options: ignore the debt ceiling and unilaterally issue new bonds, thus usurping Congress's borrowing power; unilaterally raise taxes, thus usurping Congress's taxing power; or unilaterally cut spending, thus usurping Congress's spending power. We argue that the president should choose the ""least unconstitutional"" course-here, ignoring the debt ceiling. We argue further, though more tentatively, that if the bond markets would render such debt inadequate to close the gap, the president should unilaterally increase taxes rather than cut spending. We then use the debt ceiling impasse to develop general criteria for political actors to choose among unconstitutional options. We emphasize three principles derived from a famous speech byPresident Lincoln: 1) minimize the unconstitutional assumption of power; 2) minimize sub-constitutional harm; and 3) preserve, to the extent possible, the ability of other actors to undo or remedy constitutional violations."
Social Issues	"The varieties of Afrikaans as carriers of identity - A socio-cultural perspective This article builds on the exploration of the negotiation of identity via language in post-apartheid South Africa. Specifically, it looks at the ways in which the various varieties of the Afrikaans language underpin the individual and collective identities of those Afrikaans-speaking people classified as ""Coloured"" and marginalised by poverty, location and race. Alexander (1994:24) points out that Afrikaans in the past often had been misused for political reasons in the search for identity. From a socio-cultural perspective and by means of a literature review this article will reflect on the origin and development of Afrikaans, amongst others: Cape Afrikaans and the related dialect of Muslim Afrikaans, Namakwalands and Griqua Afrikaans as examples of Orange River Afrikaans, as well as Karoo Afrikaans and Tsotsitaal as examples of Eastern Border Afrikaans. Interviews were conducted with representative speakers of the various varieties of Afrikaans, whilst the lyrics of Afrikaans songs prominent in some Afrikaans-speaking areas were also studied. The data gained from the literature review, supported by the evidence collected from the interviews and the songs, showed that the various varieties of Afrikaans are a sound indicator of identity in those Afrikaans-speaking communities under review"
Education & Educational Research	"Distributed leadership has been operationalized focusing on the perception of favorable conditions that lure leadership distribution, staff empowerment, and shared decision-making, etc., but the evidence for operational aspects of DL is far from complete. Using the 2013 TALIS data, this research used rigorous multi-level models and meta-analysis to investigate how principals, management-team members, teachers, and governing board members embark on different school leadership and management functions; and how the variations in the operation of distributed leadership are related to principals and teachers' organizational commitment and job satisfaction. The results suggested that principals' and teachers' role in developing colleagues, and the management team's leadership in instructional management are positively related to principals and teachers' job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Due to the nuanced variations found regarding how operational facets of DL are related to principals and teachers' job satisfaction and organizational commitment, future efforts to better understand this topic requires cautious evaluations of interactions between leadership functions and multiple stakeholders."
Women'S Studies	"In Canada, hijab wearing Muslim women have increasingly faced discrimination in the post 9-11 era. In this study, we investigate Muslim women's experiences with the hijab and how they are viewed as the ""other"" in a multicultural country like Canada. Interviews were conducted with twenty-six Muslim women who describe their experiences with the hijab. The study focuses on how the hijab is perceived in public and how experiences with discrimination have motivated Muslim women to reclaim their voices in a space that perceives Muslim women to be oppressed. Thematic network analysis of the data revealed three central themes: religiosity, societal prejudice and internal struggle. Discrimination was experienced by all participants and internal struggles resulted in resolution techniques that helped in mitigating negative experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Business, Finance"	"Purpose - This study aims to explore how Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listed companies manage their statutory continuous disclosure (CD) obligations. Design/methodology/approach - Employing aspects of Gibbins et al.'s corporate financial disclosure framework, this study conducts semi-structured interviews with 22 experienced senior managers from diverse companies to examine in depth the key antecedents, structures and issues influencing the CD process. Findings - The findings indicate that companies' preference to deal with CD as a commercial or legal issue, managers' practical CD experience, who assumes responsibility for CD, owners' and market expectations, third parties, environmental uncertainties and media are important antecedents in the CD process. The importance of these is contingent on company characteristics. Large companies primarily use structured processes and responsive communication networks whereas small to medium companies rely on informal processes and interpersonal communications. Despite following best practice guidelines, companies face multiple issues in managing CD. Research limitations/implications - Prior disclosure beliefs and personal biases may have a disproportionate impact on CD behaviour. Future research can examine more closely how these behavioural characteristics influence companies' disclosure policies. Practical implications This study offers insights for managers interested in managing CD more effectively. The findings suggest the importance of experience, behaving in a proactive manner and educating employees on companies' CD obligations. It offers insights for regulators on aspects of guidance that could be improved. Originality/value - The study draws on Gibbins et al.'s theoretical framework to furnish a more complete and refined understanding of the CD process."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"In the late nineteenth century, French naturalists were global leaders in microbial research. Louis Pasteur advanced sterilization techniques and demonstrated that dust particles in the air could contaminate a putrefiable liquid. Pasteur's discoveries prompted a new research program for the naturalists of the Talisman and Travailleur expeditions: to recover uncontaminated water and mud samples from the deep sea. French naturalists Adrien Certes and Paul Regnard both independently conducted experiments to address the question of whether microorganisms inhabited the oceans and whether organic material in the deep sea was subject to decomposition. The experiments of Certes and Regnard have largely been omitted from histories of microbiology and marine science. However, an examination of their work is crucial for understanding the context in which marine microbiology first developed. At the end of the nineteenth century, marine microbiology emerged from the disciplinary melding of terrestrial microbial ecology, experimental physiology, and the then-nascent field of deep-sea biology."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This article presents a case of mobilization against the systemic discrimination of care workers, the great majority of whom are woman, black and Haitian, and who occupy jobs with degraded standards in employment agencies that supply workers to one sole parapublic organization. At the intersection of the ongoing changes in workforce management and the reorganization of care management, this case is representative of how the boundaries of the employment relationship are presently being redrawn. As the mobilized workers are unionized, the case also allows us to explore a range of union attitudes. A trade union strategy predominates: it consists of defending or managing collective bargaining. It is comforted by a set of institutions that produce contradictory constructs of equality issues and the problem of discrimination. If these institutional arrangements breach employers' ""innovations"" and support the adoption of trade union strategies aimed at preserving the bilateral employment relationship, this paper argues that this strategy is also symptomatic of the monistic view with which trade unions approach the erosion of the dominant model of the employment relationship, reducing it to conflicts of interest between employers and workers. However, this erosion is also the result of the mutual and reciprocal reorganization of the different social forms of the division of labour between classes, sexes and races. By not calling into question what constitutes the basis of the compromise of the wage society, namely the reduction or exclusion of groups of the population from the standard of full-time and permanent employment, trade unions give priority to strategies which contribute, as illustrated by the case chosen, if not to the creation of discriminatory standards, at least to the legitimization of borders between those who have access to quality jobs and those who do not."
Urban Studies	"Drawing upon the game-theoretical concepts for urban land redevelopment in China, this paper provides further substantiation on, and demonstrates, two major fronts in empirical terms. First, the redevelopment trajectory of industrial land that had been used by a central state-owned enterprise (SOE) was identified and was shown as deadlocked by disputes on the pathway to cooperation between the local government and the original land user. Second, the shifts in the bargains between the pair from the ""prisoners' dilemma"" to ""pigs' payoffs,"" and then to ""neo-pigs' payoffs"" were analyzed, and we showed how industrial land can be redeveloped. Finally, we argued that disputes between the entrepreneuralization of local governments and the politicization of SOEs constitute a potent system of explanatory coordinates that effectively reveal the hidden logic of industrial land redevelopment in urban China. Different from the redevelopment of local SOEs, communications between the user and owner of urban land, as well as the tradeoff of benefits, are key factors in breaking the aforementioned deadlock."
Demography	"As parental ages at birth continue to rise, concerns about the effects of fertility postponement on offspring are increasing. Due to reproductive ageing, advanced parental ages have been associated with negative health outcomes for offspring, including decreased longevity. The literature, however, has neglected to examine the potential benefits of being born at a later date. Secular declines in mortality mean that later birth cohorts are living longer. We analyse mortality over ages 30-74 among 1.9 million Swedish men and women born 1938-60, and use a sibling comparison design that accounts for all time-invariant factors shared by the siblings. When incorporating cohort improvements in mortality, we find that those born to older mothers do not suffer any significant mortality disadvantage, and that those born to older fathers have lower mortality. These findings are likely to be explained by secular declines in mortality counterbalancing the negative effects of reproductive ageing."
Ethics	"Political decision-makers in the European Union (EU) are currently discussing the introduction of a mandatory uniform labelling scheme for meat and milk that provides information on husbandry systems similar to the already existent labelling scheme in the EU egg market. The objective of this paper was to assess whether such information is relevant to consumers when buying meat and milk. The paper was based on a systematic synthesis of 53 scientific journal articles on empirical consumer studies. The review revealed that consumers perceived the aspects of outdoor access, stocking density and floor type as important factors influencing animal welfare. On average, consumers not only had a positive attitude towards more animal welfare-friendly husbandry systems with outdoor access and space allowance but were also willing to pay a price premium for products from such systems. All studies on consumer segmentation identified at least one consumer segment that placed great importance on animal welfare-friendly husbandry systems. Interestingly, many studies identified one or more other segments who still had a significant preference for animal welfare-friendly products even though other product attributes were more important to them. Based on the findings, the paper presents conclusions regarding the labelling of husbandry systems for meat and milk."
"Education, Special"	"We examined the relations between teachers' use of comments during book reading sessions in preschool classrooms and the vocabulary growth of children with low and moderately low language ability. Using data from a larger randomized controlled trial, we analyzed comments defined as utterances that give, explain, expand, or define. Comments were coded for strategies, which were distinguished by the amount of cognitive distancing required for understanding. Strategies were divided into three levels: low, medium, and high. Videos of whole-class book reading sessions conducted in the fall were transcribed and analyzed for 489 children attending the classrooms of 52 Head Start preschool teachers. Descriptive analyses revealed that teachers largely used medium-level strategies, but relatively small amounts of low- and high-level comments. Logistic regressions revealed relationships between curriculum condition and teachers' use of instructional strategies, such that those assigned to the intervention curriculum used more high-level strategies. Multilevel models found significant relationships between medium-level comments and children's receptive vocabulary growth across one year of Head Start preschool instruction, such that children in classrooms where teachers used more medium-level comments experienced greater growth than those hearing fewer. No moderating effects were found based on children's initial language abilities. Implications for practice and future research are discussed."
History	"The existence of a Christian Enlightenment in eighteenth-century francophone Europe has started to gain some recognition in recent studies. Using a case study of the letters Georg-Jonathan von Holland sent to the Societe Typographique de Neuchatel while in the process of publishing his refutation of the baron d'Holbach's materialist Systeme de la nature, this article confirms this idea and examines the underlying conditions that led to such fundamental changes in Christian apologetic writing. It argues that during the latter half of the eighteenth century, the public sphere became the principal arena for the defence of Christianity in French. As a result, religious and conservative authors began to concentrate on deploying innovative strategies tailored to convince the body of individual readers that comprised the public. In the process, they experimented with new literary forms, discourses and approaches towards the publication process, and the Christian Enlightenment emerged."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"The decision whether to have a realist or an anti-realist attitude towards scientific hypotheses is interpreted in this paper as a choice that scientists themselves have to face in their work as scientists, rather than as a 'philosophical' problem. Scientists' choices between realism and instrumentalism (or other types of anti-realism) are interpreted in this paper with the help of two different conceptual tools: a deflationary semantics grounded in the inferentialist approach to linguistic practices developed by some authors (e.g., Sellars, Brandom), and an epistemic utility function that tries to represent the cognitive preferences of scientists. The first tool is applied to two different questions traditionally related to the problem of scientific realism: the non-miracle argument, and the continuity of reference. The second one is applied to the problem of unconceived alternatives, and to the distinction between realist and instrumentalist attitudes towards scientific hypotheses."
Demography	"The most widely used methods to measure the relative living conditions of the population (CRVs) (e.g. marginalization, poverty, social deprivation, human development), have been the basis for the design of social policies in Mexico and several Latin American countries. These predominant methods exclude the active role of space as a distributor and redistributor of welfare opportunities derived from strategic public services located in specific points in the territory (e.g. education and health services). They omit the basic fact that the supply and demand of these services must usually interact in the territory to generate benefits. As if the CRVs were molded in a non-place (Campos, 2009). The Spatial Justice paradigm incorporates space as a key redistributive agent of resources and opportunities among society (Soja, 2014). This work has the following objectives: i) Propose, from the paradigm of Space Justice, a method of measuring CRVs that authentically and operationally incorporates the spatial dimension; and, ii) demonstrate the conceptual, analytical and applied superiority of our Socio-spatial method to measure the CRVs, with respect to traditional Non-Spatial methods."
Environmental Studies	"Elimination of high-emitting industrial capacity can be an effective way to control and relieve air pollution but it will also influence demand. Accurate forecasting of electricity demand requires consideration of the impact of capacity elimination policies. This paper applies a modified firefly algorithm improved by Gaussian disturbance to optimize the parameters of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to quantify the impact of capacity elimination policies. We consider three policy scenarios and three growth scenarios in our analysis. The results demonstrate that modified firefly algorithm (MFA) can improve the forecasting performance of SVM and electricity demand forecasting considering the influence of capacity elimination policies, and provide good reference for policy analysis and electricity demand analysis.

Political Science	"This study supplements extant literature on implementation in the European Union (EU). The quantitative analysis, which covers the EU transport acquis, reveals five main findings. First, the EU has a transposition deficit in this area, with almost 70% of all national legal instruments causing problems. Second, transposition delay is multifaceted. The results provide strong support for the assertion that distinguishing between the outcomes of the transposition process ( on time, short delay or long delay) is a useful method of investigation. Third, factors specific to European directives ( level of discretion and transposition deadline) and domestic-level factors ( national transposition package and number of veto players) have different effects on the length of delay. Furthermore, the timing of general elections in member states as well as policy ( sub) sector-related accidents influence the timeliness of national transposition processes."
Area Studies	"This article analyzes two autobiographies of the Estonian-Canadian Heljo Liitoja (1923 - 2010) as participation in the post-Soviet national reconstruction of Estonia. The article argues that some of Liitoja""s experiences, such as her connection to the Toronto gay and lesbian community and the controversies within the Estonian diaspora, could not be addressed in an autobiography framed within an Estonian life story writing competition. The article suggests that Liitoja""s autobiographical book that discussed these topics was able to stretch the limits of the Estonian diaspora narrative."
Social Work	"The current study examined attitudes about the homeless among a range of social service and healthcare employees using both self-report and an experimental approach. Ninety-six respondents were recruited from drop-in shelters, medical facilities and social service agencies. After completing an initial measure of homelessness stigmatization, participants were randomly assigned into one of two experimental conditions in which they were given a description of a fictional 20-year-old client described as either homeless or domiciled. It was hypothesized that prior to the manipulation there will be no differences between the two groups and that the manipulation would induce those who read about the homeless client to subsequently endorse more stereotyped beliefs than those who read about a domiciled counterpart. The results revealed no pre-manipulation differences between the groups, while the manipulation invoked beliefs that the homeless client was dangerous, needed help with reading and financial literacy, and needed advice on personal hygiene, compared to the control group. These results highlight the work that still needs to be done in training service providers in terms of providing a bias-free environment for potential clients. Future studies should investigate whether proper training and education reduce preexisting assumptions about homeless clients."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Using the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, we explore whether the fortunes of employees paid for performance differ from those of fixed pay workers during recession. Only in the bottom quintile of the wage distribution were performance pay employees more likely to experience greater falls in real wages than fixed pay employees. Accounting for fixed unobserved worker characteristics suggests that this was not due to the wage-setting mechanism itself, but that other factors are likely to be at play. While across most of the earnings distribution there was little evidence of greater wage flexibility among performance pay employees, they did have longer job tenure than fixed pay employees over the recession."
Ethnic Studies	"This article examines the Muslim organizational field in Britain based on interviews with activists. It applies a political opportunity perspective to address the degree to which organizations' aims and activities have been shaped by the contextual factors confronting them, or more independently, by 'bottom-up' beliefs and commitments drawn from their relationships to the community. Specifically, the empirical part examines, first, how activists perceive media representation as an opportunity or constraint, and second, how their organizations have constructed collective identities in order to advance their aims within the UK context. Generally, we find that organizations have come together using under a broad ascriptive 'Muslim' label that works across denominational, national and ethnic differences. Not only is this orientation a direct response to the pressures of community cohesion policies and discourses but it also has a strong independent and faith-based component in serving the community and its social needs. The resultant Muslim organizational field is strongly acculturative to UK society, but remains critically independent of governing authorities. Finally, organizations have responded to what they see as poor media representation of Muslims by proactively engaging in media work."
Anthropology	"This article applies Ingold's conceptualization of environmental outlooks ranging from the 'globe' to the 'sphere' to explore human-environment relations and debates about the future of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Chagossians and conservationists broadly represent the two extremes of the engaged lifeworld of the sphere and the detached worldview of the globe, respectively, but I argue that this does not necessarily determine their environmental outlooks for the future. It is not simply the case either that Chagossians uniformly advocate resettlement of Chagos or that conservationists uniformly oppose resettlement. Within each group two distinct environmental outlooks are identified: engagement versus withdrawal amongst Chagossians, and exclusion versus participation amongst conservationists. The article demonstrates, then, that environmental outlooks are influenced not only by understandings of human-environment relations but also by pragmatic and ideological considerations."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"The act of diagnosing gender dysphoria (GD), as in the act of diagnosing any other condition, is structured by socio-cultural, political and economic factors and is conducted by social actors. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with practitioners who work with trans people in Portugal, the study reveals the nuances and complexities surrounding the diagnostic attribution of GD and the ways in which the ideologies regarding gender shape this attribution. Practitioners' accounts show a diversity not often acknowledged within sociological and transgender literature. We extend previous studies by demonstrating that practitioners who operate under a social model of gender are opening space for trans people to be treated as experts of their bodies and identities by accepting the existence of those who identify beyond gender binaries. While it might not be true for practitioners who can be positioned within a biological model, thus attributing an essentialist explanation of gender, we found evidence that practitioners who follow a social model are allowing room for the self-definition of gender identification. The study provides another lens for understanding the diagnostic attribution of GD by paying attention to the accounts of practitioners who work with trans people and reveals their openness towards a collaborative model of care."
International Relations	"Although the financial/Eurozone crisis has profound effects on the EU, European integration scholarship failed to even recognise that there might be a problem. This article argues that this is due to the highly orthodox nature of European integration scholarship and the blind-spots that inhere in its instrumentalist basic code. It makes the case for a heterodox recasting of the production of knowledge about the EU, and argues that post-Keynesian, post-Marxist and neo-Weberian political economy can make significant contributions in that regard."
Demography	"BACKGROUND The successful integration of immigrants is seen as a principal means to secure economic growth and welfare in many countries. Success in this task depends on the capacity to formulate effective integration policies, which in turn is based on research capable of describing and explaining the integration process properly. OBJECTIVE Our objective is to define a conceptual and quantifiable measure of full immigrant integration. This enables a quantitative evaluation of how integrated immigrants are in a specific context in an immigrant - native system - a question poorly addressed by past research. METHODS Our approach consists of looking at the functional dependency of different integration quantifiers on immigrant density. The empirical analysis uses register data from Spain. We focus on social integration and labour market integration in formal employment. RESULTS In our empirical analysis we find dramatic differences in immigrant integration levels across integration contexts. While labour market integration approaches the level of full integration, social integration quickly declines as immigration levels surge. It is shown that these differences are primarily due to the presence of social network effects in the social integration process, absent in the labour market integration process. CONCLUSIONS Proper identification of integration deficits and its causes is likely to improve the efficiency of integration policy making, and the capacity to reach integration targets. Our framework has this quality. The research presented here shows that full labour market integration of immigrants is a realistic target. However, it also shows that, if left unattended, the segregation forces contained in social networks, quite dramatically obstruct the social integration process. Lack of social integration undermines the strategy of reliance on increasing immigration to secure future economic well-being that many governments and international organizations are in the process of adopting."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This study aims to investigate the associations between quality of life, physical activity and mood states in women with breast cancer. A total of 354 women (mean age, 51.74 +/- 8.63 years; body mass index (BMI), 28 +/- 5.67 kg/m(2)) completed the Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire, Profile of Mood States (POMS), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23). Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regressions were used to verify the relations between outcomes and independent variables. Correlations between scores on POMS, Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire and global health status/quality of life subscale of EORTC QLQ-C30 found associations (p < 0.01) between physical activity (r = 0.191), vigour (r = 0.333) and fatigue (r = -0.433). Multiple linear regression analysis of the global health status/quality of life subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed significant differences for vigour (p < 0.001), social function (p = 0.003), side effects of systemic therapy (p = 0.019), arm and breast symptoms (p < 0.001) and Baecke physical activity score (p = 0.006). Physical activity is an independent factor related to the quality of life in women with breast cancer. Understanding these variables may influence clinical decisions during treatment and allow positive interventions regarding symptoms, functions and lifestyle."
International Relations	"This article advances a hierarchy-centered approach to the study of international social pressure on states. Prior scholarship has centered on the exposure of a gap between word and deed as key for social pressure. We argue that the scholarship on social pressure would benefit from paying more attention to the centrality of social hierarchies in the dynamics and effects of social pressure on states. It is through comparative assessments the normative ordering of states as superior and inferior and placement in a social hierarchy that social pressure is exerted and states are prodded into action. States positioned at the top or in the middle of normative hierarchies may be subjected to different social pressure than states positioned at the bottom. Developing this claim, we contend that normative hierarchies come in several forms. Reflecting on the dynamics of these normative hierarchies is important in and of itself, in our view, as it provides a deeper understanding of how norms generate shame, embarrassment, or status anxiety. That said, understanding normative hierarchies also gives us added purchase on explaining how states manage the social pressure of being ranked."
Ethnic Studies	"Groups of racist skinheads now constitute a significant element of the global radical right. The British youth subculture of the late 1960s has thus been transformed into a worldwide social movement, the violent cutting-edge of white supremacist resistance to multiculturalism. Pollard examines the historical development of the racist skinhead phenomenon and, in particular, analyses the origins, nature and development of the ideas that inspire it: the foundational myth; skinhead, a way of life'; Odinism or paganism; the skinhead as victim; skinheads as a vanguard of white, male, working-class revolutionaries; National Socialism and antisemitism; and, above all, racialism."
Political Science	"A key requirement of democratic governance is that policy outcomes and the majority preference of the electorate are congruent. Many studies argue that the more direct democratic a system is, the more often voters get what they want, but the empirical evidence is mixed. This analysis explores the democratic effect of initiatives and referendums theoretically and empirically. The prediction of the formal model is that ""bad"" representation (i.e., a large preference deviation between the electorate and the political elite) is good for the democratic effect of direct democracy. An empirical investigation of original voter and elite survey data, analyzed with multilevel modeling and poststratification, supports this argument. Building on the literature, the findings of the analysis suggest that the extent to which direct democratic institutions are conducive for policy congruence - and may thus be advisable as democratic correctives to representative systems - depends on the political conflict structure."
Business	"Purpose - This study aims to use product attributes and retail display information to develop cross-national segments. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses consumers' choice in wine stores to develop segments of consumers, based on the relative importance of 13 factors consumers use for the retail purchase of wine. Data are collected from 11 countries, using seven languages on five continents. Best worst scaling (BWS) and latent class analysis were used to develop the clusters. Findings - A three-cluster structure provides a straightforward and robust segmentation across the 11 countries. This model fits better than one based on 11 single country segments. The three segments reveal different ways in which consumers choose wines: cognitive-based, assurance-based, and in-store promotion-based. Research limitations/implications - The samples are convenience-based and do not represent the population of wine drinkers in each country. Choice criteria, including retail communications, can be used to develop useful and robust segments cross-nationally. Practical implications - The three segments found in this study provide clear guidelines for wine marketers depending on whether they work for small or large wine companies. The use of choice attributes and BWS show the utility of this method in cross-national research. Originality/value - This research demonstrates that product attributes and retail communication devices like labels and displays can be used for cross-national segmentation. Applying BWS and Latent Class Clustering to choice criteria leads to clear, usable, and robust segmentation across a wide range of cultures and product use histories."
Sociology	"This article draws on 27 interviews with women (with exclusive and non-exclusive sexual orientations) to understand the role of pornography in the construction of female sexuality. Building upon research that moves beyond the 'negative effects paradigm' in the study of pornography, we show that consuming pornography is both disciplining and empowering for women. Our informants recognise that pornography reproduces and promotes patriarchal discourses of sexuality, but they manage to use it to reach a state of pleasure (exercise of fantasy, sexual gratification) and perfection (optimal way of performing sex). We also show pornography's role in cultivating a renewed understanding of female sexuality. In this process, aspects of the genre are questioned, negotiated and reconciled in order to continue using pornography to satisfy desire. We contribute to ongoing debates about the role of pornography in society by documenting the experiences of women whose voices have been hitherto underrepresented in the literature."
International Relations	"This article explores the UK's foreign policy pivot to Asia, a decade after its tentative beginnings. This pivot is understood to be Britain's planned redirection of attention and resources to Asia which emerged gradually from around 2007/2008, before intensifying from 2010. It is argued that the pivot has been evident across distinctive phases and political, economic and security dimensions, while lacking organisation, clarity and purpose, leaving it partial and incomplete. Examined are the motivations for the pivot and the forms it has taken, its accomplishments and ultimately what the pivot reveals about the role and influence the UK claims in Asia today. It is shown that in its key trade and investment aims, the pivot has achieved mixed results, doing little to enhance the UK's position as a tertiary-level partner of Asia. However, Britain's agency and importance is best explained not by its quantities, but its qualities, of power, occupying the regional roles of subcontractor and facilitator. Finally, the article looks to Britain's future in Asia. Exiting the EU would likely see the UK retain its status of subcontractor, while its ability to act as facilitator would almost certainly diminish. The article concludes by arguing that, despite the rhetoric of the pivot, Britain's presence in Asia will never be defined by its quantities of material power, and that it should work to sustain the qualities of power on which its regional presence is built."
Geography	"Based on the case of the Mohawk territory of Akwesasne, wedged between Ontario, Quebec, and New York state, this paper provides an analysis of the links between the affirmation of indigenous culture and the implementation of security policies on borderlands. The focus extends beyond political conflicts over border issues to encompass the ways in which Aboriginal sovereignty is affirmed within processes of negotiation and cooperation in the matters of identification requirements, border agents"" cultural sensitivity, and law enforcement. We find that the enhancement of border security can paradoxically be a political opportunity for local leaders to reaffirm indigenous sovereignty, and that this reaffirmation through cooperation is, at the same time, emerging as a key factor in the implementation of border security policies."
Linguistics	"Different signals, or tuning devices, in language, including certain discourse markers, comparatives, intensifiers and semantic metalanguage, sometimes accompany verbal metaphors. Some scholars have claimed that these signals give evidence of ""deliberate metaphor"" use on the part of speakers and writers. So, understanding these particular uses of metaphor requires people to infer deliberation, which leads them to pay greater notice to these figures and enhances their understanding of the cross-domain mappings motivating metaphorical utterances. Many linguistic analyses argue that deliberate metaphor is a critical part of metaphor use, yet no empirical study has explored whether people really infer greater deliberation and cross-domain mappings when encountering so-called pragmatic signals of metaphor. The present study tested this idea and did not find evidence in support of the deliberate metaphor proposal. This conclusion raises serious doubts about the psychological validity of the idea that some metaphors are produced and understood as being deliberate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Management	"Today's business environment poses a significant challenge to many firms, namely to continuously innovate, combining operational excellence with both steady-state and discontinuous innovation. At a closer look, it can also be seen that a number of leading firms today seem to be able to handle the resulting situation quite well, revealing good operational and innovation performance over time. At the same time, the bulk of management theory still approaches this problem with a trade-off perspective, implying that these aspects of business are analysed separately, and that efficiency and innovation have to be regarded as mutually excluding things to strive for - suggesting that firms can be good in one of the two abilities but not in both simultaneously. This points to a gap in existing research that scholars need to fill. Building on management literature about paradoxes and dualities, and using some examples from practice, this contribution stresses the 'practicability' of the duality perspective for Continuous Innovation research and practice."
Cultural Studies	"This article focuses on the way in which renowned Sao Paulo-based theatre company Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona deconstructs hegemonic historical narrative in their 2000-2007 25-hour-long production of Euclides da Cunha's seminal Brazilian novel Os sertoes (""Rebellion in the Backlands""), an account of the War of Canudos (1896-1897), the first major act of State terrorism carried out by the nascent Brazilian Federal Government on the country's subaltern population. The Teat(r)o Oficina's epic adaptation fuses events from the colonial period, the military dictatorship and contemporary twenty-first-century Sao Paulo to relate the repetitive cycles of misappropriation, oppression and resistance that have characterized the history of Brazil and its people over the centuries. However, any fatalistic view of victimhood as an essential aspect of Brazilian subjectivity is radically challenged by the vibrant, rhythmic, material impact of the theatrical super-signs underpinning the performance text. Drawing on Julia Kristeva's notion of the semiotic - the pre-linguistic, illogical, rhythmical materialism of language intimately related to a primordial relationship with the abject mother - I shall suggest that it is the rhythmic, libidinal force of the performance and its extensive use of the cultural manifestations of Brazil's subaltern population that imbues Os Sertoes with the silent presence-as-absence of the abject Brazilian (M)Other - the Black, Indigenous and Mestiza matriarchal line whose alternative discourse is often barred from hegemonic accounts of Brazilian historiography. Her silent heritage is embodied on stage by the members of the Oficina, who reclaim an alienating national heritage for themselves by transforming the often tragic tale of Brazil's past into a joyous celebration of tenacious vitality."
Economics	"We use micro data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to document how Federal Income tax liabilities vary with income, marital status and the number of dependents. We report facts on the distributions of average taxes, properties of the joint distributions of taxes paid and income, and discuss how taxes are affected by marital status and the number of children. We also provide multiple parametric estimates of tax functions for use in applied work in macroeconomics and public finance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Ethics	"Concerns about the under-representation of female academic philosophers and about the stereotype that philosophy is best done by men have recently led to efforts to make academic philosophy a more inclusive discipline. An example is the Gendered Conference Campaign, encouraging event organisers and volume editors to include women amongst invited speakers and authors. Initiatives such as the GCC raise worries about tokenism. Potential invitees may be concerned about unfairness towards whose who would have been invited in their place in the absence of affirmative action and about the way in which affirmative action can (be perceived to) affect the quality of the conference or volume in question. And women philosophers often worry that, if formal rules or significant social pressures towards gender inclusiveness play a role in selection processes, their achievements will be discounted. I argue there is no good reason for these fears: there is no pure meritocracy in academia, nor is the ideal of pure meritocracy either feasible or desirable. There are several legitimate grounds independent of professional competence for including people in positions of visibility and prestige; gender is such a legitimate reason."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"We estimate dynamic effects of works councils on labour productivity using newly available information from West German establishment panel data. Conditioning on plant fixed effects and control variables, we find negative productivity effects during the first five years after council introduction but a steady and substantial increase in the councils' productivity effect thereafter. Our findings support a causal interpretation for the positive correlation between council existence and plant productivity that has been frequently reported in previous studies."
Ethnic Studies	"The current capitalist system has had a devastating impact on working people across the globe. The crisis in the Eurozone has been clear with the massive cuts in social services all over Europe, especially in Greece, Spain, and Portugal. These cuts have been enacted under the banner of austerity in order to restore the economic health of these societies. The United States has hovered between the draconian austerity in Europe and the new assertiveness of the working peoples and their representatives. For a short moment, the neo-conservatives wanted to roll back the rights of workers and diminish the rights to collective bargaining. These struggles came to a head in the 2012 elections when the people voted decisively against the candidate of the one percent. In the wake of the massive statement of the electorate, the scare of the debt ceiling is being used to enact strict austerity measures in the United States. The article stresses the need for progressive people to organize to oppose militarization, defend livelihoods and social security protection, and chart the path towards alternatives. This organization will demand a level of literacy on the role of the dollar in the international political system and the need for new relations to bring about a multipolar world devoid of military or economic hegemons. The article will argue that austerity has already been enacted on the oppressed workers, especially the black and brown workers and that a new awareness of the nature of the capitalist system is necessary at this conjuncture."
History	"The first three chapters deal with different links of film studies, history studies and various forms of outreach and education of both to describe an eternal triangle. The general perspective of the argument concentrates on aesthetics, in particular narration, image and sound in the context of a broader frame of methodologies in the field of film studies. The theoretical approach is then worked through a case study on Wolfgang Becker's film ""Good bye, Lenin!"" (D 2003). The film is analysed with regard to the aesthetic modes of production of personal and national histories."
Communication	"This article makes legible emergent social imaginaries of digital touch for remote communication in personal relationships, with attention to digital touch interfaces. It draws on data from rapid prototyping research workshops with apprentice professionals embedded within digital communication. Touch is discussed with respect to four analytical themes: materiality, body, emplacement and temporality. We illustrate how participants' past and present experiences and future visions of remote digital touch thread through these themes and weave together to form a hegemonic, emergent sociotechnical imaginary of digital touch. The article contributes to social debates within digital personal remote communication by foregrounding touch, the material and the sensorial. The article's novel interdisciplinary framework (combining design-based rapid prototyping with a multimodal and multi-sensorial analysis within the frame of the sociotechnical imaginary) also contributes to methodology around future-facing phenomena, prior to the process of their solidification into material, political formations."
Environmental Studies	"Research on biogas technology adoption lacks information of the diffusion process in which included the acceleration of the adoption. In this paper, a duration analysis model is employed to model the speed of biogas technology adoption among small mixed crop and livestock farmers in Indonesia. A duration approach can model the adoption in a timely process to determine the biogas technology diffusion. Findings from this study indicate that there is an overall slow rate of biogas diffusion among farmers. There are however several ways to support the diffusion. It is revealed that 1) longer education, 2) higher farm income, 3) women involvement in the diffusion process and 4) access to financial support significantly accelerate the diffusion process. Farmer's perception of the relative advantages of biogas technology and their experience from testing the biogas technology also support the uptake of technology at the farm level. In addition, a technology dissemination strategy of stakeholders, especially local government is essential since the different regional regulations and policies have an important role to accelerate the diffusion process."
Nursing	"The aims of this mixed methods study were to gain insight into how individual assessors determine an Objective Structured Clinical Assessment (OSCA) result for undergraduate nursing students and identify whether individual assessor perceptions and professional characteristics have an impact on students' results. Results from 25 participants showed that although less than half (44%) of the participants were teaching in the course that they were assessing, the participants were highly experienced clinicians and nearly three-quarters (72%) had completed formal teaching qualifications. There were wide variations in pass rates (16.7-90%) between assessors. The widest disparity was observed between assessors with and those without critical care experience (66% versus 39%), as well as assessors who were teaching the course and those who were not (68% versus 49%). Qualitative analysis revealed three dominant themes within participants' transcripts. The themes focused on determining student safety, and the use of personal perceptions and clinical experience to determine competency. Findings indicate that assessors' individual perceptions and clinical experience have the potential to influence and determine undergraduate nursing students OSCA results. Development of criteria standards and objective assessment may be enhanced by greater involvement of assessors and thorough education and training within the context of student assessments.

Social Issues	"Dictionaries reflect the actual use of a given language, they also contribute to the documentation and eventual standardisation of the language. This applies to dictionaries that have the language for general purposes as its subject matter; but also to dictionaries that focus on different languages for special purposes. The lexicographic practice of Afrikaans displays a comprehensive collection of dictionaries that represent a broad typological spectrum. This collection includes both better and lesser known dictionaries and dictionary types. As a container of knowledge, each dictionary can be regarded as a monument of the language treated in that dictionary. However, many dictionaries do not receive the recognition they deserve as practical language instruments, because their typological category puts them beyond the day to day dictionary experience of the majority of people. This paper pays attention to products from both the lexicographic practice and the field of dictionary research, also known as metalexicography, that have become monuments within the broad field of lexicography. Metalexicographic publications receive only scant attention. The primary discussion is directed at the lexicographic practice, with the main focus on the contribution of a few lesser known Afrikaans dictionaries. In this regard, two major classes are distinguished, i.e. community projects and innovative products. Within the first category, the attention is focused on a dictionary that displays the creativeness of members of the Afrikaans language community in the formation of neologisms. It is shown that although these neologisms may not become part of the standard variety of the language, they do emphasise the creative nature of Afrikaans and this dictionary gives evidence of this word formation products. A second dictionary in this category represents a product with the genuine purpose to make people aware of a language that is becoming extinct and to reflect something of the people and the culture of this language. This community-driven dictionary has an innovative, genuine purpose, showing how members of the Jul 'hoan speech community, as well as people from the English and Afrikaans speech communities, compiled a selection of core vocabulary items from the Jul 'hoan lexicon, arranged in thematic categories that reflect important aspects from their daily life. The use of pictorial illustrations as guiding elements of the articles results in an interesting article structure and allows access from picture to word. The members of the speech community were not only involved in the planning and compilation of the dictionary, but their artists created the pictorial illustrations that reflect something of the world view of the community. In the second category, a few dictionaries are mentioned because of their innovative approach. One dictionary is discussed in more detail, i.e. a bilingual dictionary with Afrikaans and English as language pair, but which was compiled specifically for English speaking users who want to learn Afrikaans. The target user and the genuine purpose of the dictionary were identified in an unambiguous way. This dictionary adheres to an integrated approach that sees a creative use of a frame structure with a variety of outer texts. It successfully negotiates a transtextual functional approach to outer texts, and supplies the envisaged target users with datafrom which information can be retrieved to satisfy both communicative and cognitive needs. The selection of outer texts adds to the comprehensive knowledge transfer made available in this dictionary. This polyfunctional dictionary was planned in such a way that dictionary and grammar are integrated into a single source. The lexicographers clearly identified the needs and reference skills of their target users, and the outer texts complement the lexicographic treatment and enhance the nature and extent of information retrieval in this dictionary. Although the focus in this article remains on lexicographic practice, the discussion is done within a theoretical framework, i.e. the general theory of lexicography, which looks at dictionary structures, and function theory, emphasising the importance that the compilation of any dictionary needs to be preceded by an identification of the function(s) the dictionary has to address."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This paper estimates the impact of promotions and promotion expectations on job satisfaction using the 1996-2006 waves of the NLSY79 dataset. Having received a promotion in the past 2 years leads to increased job satisfaction, even while controlling for the worker's current wage, wage rank within her peer group, and wage growth. Workers who believe a promotion is possible in the next 2 years also report higher job satisfaction. Additionally, past promotions have a lingering, but fading impact on job satisfaction."
Demography	"BACKGROUND In longitudinal research the loss of sample members between waves is a possible source of bias. It is therefore crucial to analyse attrition. OBJECTIVE This paper analyses attrition in a longitudinal study on family and fertility, by distinguishing between attrition due to non-contact and attrition due to non-cooperation. METHODS Based on the first two waves of the Austrian Generations and Gender Survey, the two components of attrition are studied separately by using bivariate as well as multivariate methods. Moreover, overall dropout - the combination of both components - is analysed. Apart from various socio-economic characteristics and data collection information, the study focuses on fertility-relevant variables such as fecundity, fertility intentions, sexual orientation, and traditional attitudes. RESULTS Fecundity, fertility intentions, and homosexual relationships are associated with higher attrition due to non-cooperation in bivariate analyses, but have no explanatory power in the multivariate model. Pregnancy and traditional attitudes towards marriage are associated with significantly lower attrition due to non-cooperation in the multivariate context. Overall dropout is significantly lower only among persons with traditional attitudes towards marriage, although small in size and statistical significance. Moreover, various individual and regional characteristics are significantly associated with dropout, with differences between attrition due to non-contact and attrition due to non-cooperation. CONCLUSIONS Detailed insights into attrition are not only important when using longitudinal data and interpreting results, but also for the design of future data collections. The Austrian GGS panel has a relatively low dropout (22%) and is affected by a small bias towards family-oriented persons as well as less-educated respondents and persons with migration backgrounds, but the data can be used without concern about selectivity."
History Of Social Sciences	"In 1961 Carlo Doglio (1914-1995) left London, where he had spent the previous six years studying Town Planning (among other things), to join the poet, activist, and social worker Danilo Dolci in leading the development plan of one of the poorest and most marginalized Italian regions: Sicily. Doglio's actions were guided by a constant dissatisfaction with a model of society that excluded communities from the decision-making process. In Sicily, he saw this as an opportunity to use technical knowledge and experience to achieve a different model of social organization, based on social cooperation and voluntary action. As a militant planner and anarchist, he believed that the planning process had to be structured from the bottom-up in order to offer choices that could be freely discussed and appropriately fulfilled, by the community. Based on original documents from the planner's archive, this study provides an overview of his work in Sicily, the place where his theories and practices best express his identity as a planner. Although this article offers a detailed examination of Doglio's work, it also introduces the notion of urban and regional planning as a form of social action and as a means to promote a new form of society, built on pro-active and cooperative communities."
Nursing	Background: Invincibility is a phase of social-cognitive development of the adolescent and has been associated with risk behavior involvement. Objective: To determine psychometric properties of the Adolescent Invincibility Tool (AIT). Methods: Reliability was assessed and validity was examined using principal components analysis. Results: Internal consistency was demonstrated with a Cronbach's alpha of 88; factor analysis led to the confirmation of subscales. Criterion validity was validated with similar and opposing measures of invincibility. Discussion: Initial testing suggests that the AIT is a valid and reliable tool for screening invincibility. Further testing is recommended to determine relevance for other populations of youth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Environmental Studies	"Revealing the adaptive responses of ecological, social, and economic systems to a transforming biosphere is crucial for understanding system resilience and preventing collapse. However, testing the theory that underpins complex adaptive system organization (e. g., panarchy theory) is challenging. We used multivariate time series modeling to identify scale-specific system organization and, by extension, apparent resilience mechanisms. We used a 20-year time series of invertebrates and phytoplankton from 26 Swedish lakes to test the proposition that a few key-structuring environmental variables at specific scales create discontinuities in community dynamics. Cross-scale structure was manifested in two independent species groups within both communities across lakes. The first species group showed patterns of directional temporal change, which was related to environmental variables that acted at broad spatiotemporal scales (reduced sulfate deposition, North Atlantic Oscillation). The second species group showed fluctuation patterns, which often could not be explained by environmental variables. However, when significant relationships were found, species-group trends were predicted by variables (total organic carbon, nutrients) that acted at narrower spatial scales (i.e., catchment and lake). Although the sets of environmental variables that predicted the species groups differed between phytoplankton and invertebrates, the scale-specific imprints of keystone environmental variables for creating cross-scale structure were clear for both communities. Temporal trends of functional groups did not track the observed structural changes, suggesting functional stability despite structural change. Our approach allows for identifying scale-specific patterns and processes, thus providing opportunities for better characterization of complex adaptive systems organization and dynamics. This, in turn, holds potential for more accurate evaluation of resilience in disparate system types (ecological, social, economic)."
Law	"By analyzing wills submitted for execution to Israeli tribunals in the years 2000-2004, this article offers insights into the process of the legalization of death and family relations. The length, aesthetics, phrasing, and contents of the wills examined are all evidence of a process in which the personal wishes of testators are transformed into a standardized legal document that tells very little about the individual testator. The rarity of cases in which testators do use their wills to disclose personal sentiments and thoughts highlights the neglected potential of wills to constitute a unique, personal, and emotional parting statement. The article demonstrates that this potential embodies the different ways in which wills were perceived in ancient times. Inspired by these past and present examples and on the basis of a bifocal relational perception of inheritance, I argue that lawyers should adopt a broader human understanding of wills and offer their clients the option of leaving behind a will with a soul."
Gerontology	"In 2008, South Korea launched a Basic Old-Age Pension program, which provides income support for the bottom 60% of the population, and a universal Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) program. We investigate the effect of both policies on subjective well-being of the elderly. We use panel data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, with the 2006 data representing the ""pretreatment'' and the 2008 data the ""posttreatment'' situations. We use regression methods for purposes of inferring program impacts. Our findings suggest that satisfaction with economic status was slightly improved by LTCI alone, and by LTCI and basic old-age pension in combination, depending on the estimator used. We found no policy impacts on satisfaction with health conditions. The benefits provided by the two programs may be insufficient to raise well-being in the population as a whole; alternatively, the outcomes may have been measured too soon after the policies were implemented."
Public Administration	"The article discusses the relation between the institution of Ombudsman and of public relations within public administration. To this end, it analyzes the evolution of the concept of Ombudsman and lays down the similarities of the concepts of public relations and Ombudsman. The article also touches upon the developments in Turkey. The institution of Ombudsman is analyzed as a concept that explains the functions of public relations. These functions would include the institution's recognizing its environment and transforming the institution based on the demands of the environment. In Turkey, Ombudsman has emerged as a concept that is not very practiced in the public administration tradition of paying attention to the problems of the public and transforming the administration based on these demands. Yet public relations in public administration aims at not only informing the environment but also improving the applications of the administrations based on the demands received by the administration. Thus, the practices of Ombudsman matches with the objectives of public administration."
International Relations	"How do Chinese scholars and students residing in the United States view the United States? This study tries to answer this question using a unique dataset from the United States. It also seeks to identify the determinants of Chinese migrants' attitudes towards the United States, especially with regard to overseas socialization. On the whole, the results indicate that Chinese scholars and students in the United States have a mostly favourable attitude towards America and remain positive towards China. Their values, overseas experience, and other factors have important influences on their feelings towards the United States. We find that most respondents have a positive attitude towards the United States, as regards both its general national image and diverse images, including political institutions, the economy, and the environment. We also find that this group of Chinese respondents maintains a strong attachment to China and has a conservative attitude towards China's future growth. Our results suggest that values such as nationalism and ethnocentrism have significant influence on individuals' feelings towards the United States."
History Of Social Sciences	"In 1950, Lineu Prestes, the then mayor of Sao Paulo, commissioned the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), a commercial corporation headquartered in New York and owned by Nelson Rockefeller, to draw up a detailed report concerning the general planning of public works for the municipality of Sao Paulo. The urban planner Robert Moses was appointed Director of Studies and another 10 advisors were appointed to work in the 'Program of Public Improvements'. The improvement plan for Sao Paulo was not an isolated initiative among those developed by IBEC, but it was very different from the other planning studies that had been conducted to date in that it was actually a consultative assignment. While performing technical studies, IBEC also identified opportunities for American companies to operate in Brazil; hence, the plan aroused great controversy. This paper seeks to establish how the Program emerged from the political and economic context of the post-Second World War period in relation to Nelson Rockefeller's activities in Latin America and Brazil, and it seeks to analyse, from the point of view of urban planning, the role played by the Program in the planning and development of the city of Sao Paulo."
Area Studies	"Karakhanid Turkish had been used as common written language among Turks in the 11th and 12th centuries. Only few books written in Karakhanid Turkish could survive until today. One of these few books is Qutadgu Bilig. The manuscript written by the author of this book, which has three copies written at various times and in various places, is lost. This situation gave birth to the question about which one of the copies is more archaic. There is a general belief in Turcology about Fergana copy as being older in comparison with two other copies. In this study, the aforementioned belief was attempted to be scientifically proved by means of the linguistic evidences. Three copies of Qutadgu Bilig were compared to detect which copy is the closest to the manuscript written by its author. Copies were compared under three headlines as morphology, phonetics, and vocabulary. At the end of the assessment, it came out that the copy of Ferghana is more archaic compared to the other two copies, that the copy of Herat is the new copy; and it is concluded that the Egyptian copy stands closer to the copy of Ferghana."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"We develop a cost-benefit model for streamlining allocation of field staff efforts invested in attempting to interview the designated sample units. By accounting for heterogeneous response propensity among various population groups, the costs of fieldwork, and the utility of the information gathered in a survey, the model provides a guideline for determining the optimal maximum number of attempts to interview. Limiting interview attempts lowers the survey's response rate, possibly creating a nonresponse bias - a factor that is not directly reflected in a cost-benefit reckoning. We demonstrate the use of the model by simulating different limits on the number of attempts to conduct a face-to-face interview in Israel's Household Expenditure Survey. Under the most stringent simulated limit - three attempts to interview in the Arab sector and four attempts in the Jewish sector, in which the response rate falls from 88% to 76% - we found that limiting the number of attempts to interview causes no significant bias in estimates of the main survey variables."
Gerontology	"ObjectivesTo estimate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to increase pneumococcal, influenza, and pertussis-containing vaccine uptake in adults aged 65 and older in primary care practices. DesignMarkov decision analysis model, comparing the cost-effectiveness of the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program with no intervention. SettingDiverse primary care practices in two U.S. cities. ParticipantsClinical trial participants aged 65 and older. MeasurementsQuality-adjusted life years (QALYs), public health outcomes, and costs. Vaccination rates and intervention costs were derived from a randomized controlled cluster trial. Other parameters were derived from the medical literature and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. All parameters were individually and simultaneously varied over their distributions. ResultsWith the intervention program and extrapolating over 10 years, there would be approximately 60,920 fewer influenza cases, 2,031 fewer pertussis cases, and 13,842 fewer pneumococcal illnesses in adults aged 65 and older. Total per-person vaccination and illness costs with the intervention were $23.93 higher than without the intervention, with a concurrent increase in effectiveness of 0.0031 QALYs, or $7,635 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, no individual parameter variation caused the intervention to cost more than $50,000 per QALY gained. ConclusionsImplementing an intervention based on the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program is a cost-effective undertaking in primary care practices for individuals aged 65 and older, with predicted public health benefits."
Business	"Despite the pivotal role of positioning in marketing strategy formulation, few studies explicitly examine positioning strategies employed by foreign and indigenous firms operating in the same cultural milieu. Relying on the concepts of culture and positioning as the backdrop, this research contributes to the literature by answering two key research questions: What are the differences between African indigenous firms"" and Africa-based foreign firms"" pursuits of positioning strategies? And is a Western-developed typology of positioning strategies applicable in an African cultural milieu, and more specifically, in the Ghanaian cultural environment? The results of the study demonstrate that indigenous and foreign firms replicate each other""s positioning strategies to carve out positions, although foreign firms aggressively pursue a wider range of strategies than indigenous firms. While there is a uniform attempt by indigenous and foreign firms to reach the mass-market and lowerto middle-class target audiences, foreign firms focus more on middle-class audiences than do indigenous firms. The authors discuss implications for marketing theory and practice."
Communication	"In this article, we propose a new theoretical premise called the ""carrier wave principle."" It holds that there is no fixed limit to the amount and variety of knowledge that may be produced from a given cultural artifact. This can be understood in relation to the exponential growth in the power and ubiquity of computational processing, which has reduced the procedural distance between cultural production, transmission, archiving, reception, and analysis. The resulting cascade of new interpretive epistemes has challenged the capacity of individuals, communities, and institutions to adapt, posing real-world challenges for privacy, identity, and subjectivity. We conclude that this principle will be integral to developing media, policies, and technologies that empower individuals and communities as computational processing continues to expand in adoption and scope."
Management	"This study examines how coworker interactions and psychological collectivism impact an employee's likelihood of engaging in taking charge behavior. Work group contextual factors examined include team-member exchange (TMX), coworker support and psychological collectivism. Results show that TMX and psychological collectivism were significantly related to an individual's propensity to engage in taking charge behavior. This study highlights the importance that one's interactions with coworkers can have on an employee's willingness to engage in taking charge behavior, contributing an important new perspective to the literature on the contextual antecedents that drive an individual's behavioral efforts to bring about innovation and change. Implications for research and practitioners are discussed."
Law	"Armed drones pose a major threat to the general prohibition on the inter-state use of force and to respect for human rights. On the battlefield, in a situation of armed conflict, the use of armed drones may be able to satisfy the fundamental international humanitarian law rules of distinction and proportionality (although attributing international criminal responsibility for their unlawful use may prove a significant challenge). Away from the battlefield, the use of drone strikes will often amount to a violation of fundamental human rights. Greater clarity on the applicable legal regime along with restraints to prevent the further proliferation of drone technology are urgently needed."
Information Science & Library Science	"Today we have unprecedented access to datasets bearing huge potential in regard to both business and research. However, beside their unquestionable utility, privacy breaches pose a significant risk to the release of these datasets (e.g., datasets originating from healthcare are good examples), thus service providers must use anonymization techniques to minimize the risk of unwanted disclosure. In this study, we focus on de-anonymization attacks, algorithms that are designed to ""reverse"" the anonymization process. In particular, we focus on a novel segment of these attacks that involve machine learning to improve robustness and efficiency. Furthermore, we highlight and discuss the similarity between de-anonymization and authentication: how can these algorithms, which are generally perceived as unethical, be used legitimately for security reasons under special constraints."
Rehabilitation	"Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) have the same aspirations as the rest of the population, including meaningful work, decent housing, financial security, friendships, health, and a high quality of life. Over the past two decades, the psychiatric rehabilitation field has made significant advancements in the development of effective service models to help consumers with SMI pursue meaningful, personal goals in recovery. Six practices (assertive community treatment, family psychoeducation, illness management and recovery, integrated duals disorders treatment, medication management according to protocol, and supported employment) have been designated as evidence-based practices (EBPs); the evidence is more compelling for three of these. Moreover, other practices also merit consideration as EBPs. This paper reviews the primary needs and aspirations of consumers with SMI, summarizes the EBP movement in psychiatric rehabilitation, and maps practices to the areas of consumers' needs to clarify outcome domains addressed by existing EBPs. Drawing from a variety of other reviews, three additional practices (supported housing, social skills training, and cognitive behavior therapy) are identified as evidence-based. We identify several critical outcome domains for which the research literature offers inadequate guidance regarding appropriate practices. Practices that help consumers in the areas of relationships, social functioning, and avoidance of incarceration are urgently needed."
Communication	"This article proposes an inventory of key ethical issues emerging from the production of reality TV shows, with a primary focus on participants' rights/interests and program makers' responsibilities. The analysis is structured according to four categories of potential harm (intrusion, humiliation, misrepresentation, and appropriation) and different stages of the production process, integrating theorizations on media, documentary, and image ethics with insights derived from 48 semistructured qualitative interviews with reality professionals and participants and several contracts. It is argued that professional practice needs to be informed by ethical considerations and accountability measures, touching a middle ground between incident-centered and allen-compassing critiques and between structural factors at industry and genre levels and (situational) measures of agency and differentiation."
Communication	"Corporate web sites have significant roles in building a positive image with stakeholders, particularly in a host market environment with different cultural backgrounds and values. A content analysis was conducted to study the glocalization strategies of corporate web sites and depiction of cultural values of 47 international brands which were identified as having Indonesian web sites. The four types of glocalization strategies of corporate web site content differed in the depiction of cultural values on their web sites. The differences could be found in overall analysis and four of five cultural dimensions such as collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance and high context communication. It integrates the theory of glocalization strategy and cultural values in the context of cyberspace, which represents a pioneering attempt in investigating the aforementioned issue."
Demography	"Thailand's population is aging rapidly and the number of older adults suffering from health limitations is expected to increase. Making use of several rounds of the Survey of Older Persons, we look at the education-specific prevalences of three health indicators over time and find a positive education gradient for difficulties with ADLs and poor self-rated health, but not for functional limitations. Combining these age-, sex- and education-specific prevalences for each indicator with population projections up to 2050, we see a lower projected number of persons with difficulties with ADLs or bad health as compared to an approach when we only account for differences by age and sex. Still, irrespective of the approach taken, we project a significant increase in the number of persons 50+ that have at least one ADL difficulty, at least one functional limitation or suffer from poor health. Our results provide estimates for future care needs and illustrate the possibly preventive effect of education."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Social determinants of health (SDH) data collected in health care settings could have important applications for clinical decision-making, population health strategies, and the design of performance-based incentives and penalties. One source for cataloging SDH data is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). Objective: To explore how SDH are captured with ICD Ninth revision SDH V codes in a national inpatient discharge database. Materials and Methods: Data come from the 2013 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample, a national stratified sample of discharges from 4363 hospitals from 44 US states. We estimate the rate of ICD-9 SDH V code utilization overall and by patient demographics and payer categories. We additionally estimate the rate of SDH V code utilization for: (a) the 5 most common reasons for hospitalization; and (b) the 5 conditions with the highest rates of SDH V code utilization. Results: Fewer than 2% of overall discharges in the National Inpatient Sample were assigned an SDH V code. There were statistically significant differences in the rate of overall SDH V code utilization by age categories, race/ethnicity, sex, and payer (all P < 0.001). Nevertheless, SDH V codes were assigned to <7% of discharges in any demographic or payer subgroup. SDH V code utilization was highest for major diagnostic categories related to mental health and alcohol/substance use-related discharges. Conclusions: SDH V codes are infrequently utilized in inpatient settings for discharges other than those related to mental health and alcohol/substance use. Utilization incentives will likely need to be developed to realize the potential benefits of cataloging SDH information."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: In spite of the compulsory health insurance in Germany, many people only have limited access to medical services. This has serious consequences, especially in the field of sexual health. The affected people are not only undocumented migrants, but also many people from the new European Union countries who are temporarily living in Germany. Many of these people, especially in larger cities, frequent STD counselling centers. Method: Since 2002, in addition to basic socio-demographic data, other anonymous data have been recorded for all consultations in the STD offices of the Cologne Health Department. These data include the patients' country of origin, reason for consultation, whether the patients are medically insured, as well as the medical services provided and the diagnoses. The data is evaluated with the help of Epilnfo. Results: During the study period, between 608 and 883 people visited the STD Counselling Centre per year. During this period, 4235 people received in total medical help. The proportion of patients with a migration history rose from 65% in 2002 to 83% in 2010. The proportion of patients without health insurance rose from 45% (2002) to 67 % (2010). About half of the counselled migrants were, at least for a short time, involved in professional sexwork. The number of counselled patients from the sub-Saharan region decreased from 123 (2002) to 72 (2010). The number of patients from Central Europe increased from 112 to 364 in this period. Migrants were over-represented in the group of patients who were diagnosed with gonorrhea and trichomoniasis, as well as among women with a conspicuous cytological swab. Chlamydia infections were, in contrast, more frequent among German clients. Gender, sexual orientation, age and the proportion of people involved in sexwork are, however, more important predictive factors than having an immigration status. Conclusion: The client spectrum has changed considerably during the study period. These changes are related to economic and political developments, as well as to the consequences of immigration laws. For the majority of patients with a migration history, the STD centre is the primary means of access to medical care in Germany. The rapid change in the client spectrum, the patients' limited access to information and to medical care and the resulting changes in epidemiology represent a major challenge for the public health services."
International Relations	"The article presents an analysis of Poland""s potential role as a European hub supporting the transportation of goods on the route between China and the EU. The authors point out a number of factors that can favour the development of a Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) hub in Poland. At the same time, they emphasise that higher demand for shipments through the New Eurasian Land Bridge within the SREB does not automatically mean that Poland will become the main hub on its European end. The study highlights several important aspects of competition as a result of which Poland is likely to adopt the role of a regional hub in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Objectives: Food insecurity and diet-related chronic health conditions are interrelated problems in rural communities. The population facing such outcomes may rely on food pantries as a way to gain access to food. Many food pantries use a traditional distribution model that restricts choice. Yet, dietary recommendations and the need to economize food resources place many challenges on households. In this research, we sought to determine whether clients self-reporting chronic health conditions in their households have unique perceptions about food pantries and their ability to meet needs. Methods: We surveyed clients (N = 612) of limited or non-choice rural pantries, each representing a unique household. We classified clients into 3 groups: no chronic condition; one chronic condition or more, but no diabetes; one chronic condition or more including diabetes. We compared group perceptions of pantries. Results: All conditions desired more choice, and more preference for certain food groups such as produce and dairy. Clients with chronic conditions and diabetes in their household had a greater percentage of negative comments about the choices offered and were less comfortable talking to volunteers. Conclusions: Rural pantries may serve clients with chronic health conditions by offering client choice and by engaging with them regarding needs and preferences."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: The study aimed to examine and compare the content of the quality of life in short-stature youth questionnaire (QoLISSY) with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - Children and Youth (ICF-CY). Methods: Items of the QoLISSY questionnaire for children/adolescents and their parents were coded within the framework of the ICF-CY. Linkage was performed according to predetermined standards by two health professionals experienced in the conceptual fundaments of the ICF-CY. Results: Within the linking process 58 meaningful concepts were identified from the 55 items out of the QoLISSY parent questionnaire and 55 meaningful concepts from the 50 items of the QoLISSY (children) questionnaire. In total, 57 concepts (parent-questionnaire) and 54 concepts (children-questionnaire) were linked to the different categories of the ICF-CY. Twenty-seven categories (parents-version) and 20 categories (child-version) referred to the component body functions, 34 categories (parent-version) and 30 categories (child-version) represented the activity and participation component and in each version 30 categories represented the environmental factors component. Conclusions: The present study indicates that the ICF-CY provides a useful frame of reference to compare and examine the content of HrQoL instruments for short-statured children and adolescents and their parents. The linkage of the QoLISSY instrument within the framework of the ICF-CY translates its content into a universal language."
Management	"This paper examines how ties to large-scale state-owned enterprises and ties to banks affect firm performance in emerging economies. The findings, obtained from survey data collected from 208 firms in the Chinese manufacturing industry, indicate that both categories of ties improve firm performance. The value of the two categories of ties changes in organizational contexts that vary in terms of the moderators of size, age, and firm strategy. Specifically, ties to banks improve the performance of younger firms significantly more than that of older firms, while ties to large-scale state-owned enterprises improve the performance of smaller firms significantly more than that of larger firms."
History Of Social Sciences	"In 1928, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial granted funds to the University of Cincinnati to establish a child study and parent education program for African Americans. This paper traces the origin of the idea for this program to a special relationship between the family of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., and Spelman College, an African American women's college in Atlanta, Georgia. This relationship embodied Rockefeller's interest in women and children, in Baptist charities, in higher education (especially in the South), and race. The case study of this relationship addresses the larger question: To what purpose was the African American woman to be educated? (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Education, Special"	"Students who report high levels of intrinsic motivation (IM) perform better on academic tasks compared with students who report low levels of IM. However, there is a paucity of data on IM for several disability categories (e.g., intellectual disability). The focus of this study was to use a nationally representative sample of students with disabilities to understand whether teachers' perceptions of students' academic IM varied by disability categories. Correlation and regression models were used to determine factors that influenced teachers' perceptions of academic IM for students with disabilities. Controlling for external factors, such as parental expectation of their child's academic career and teachers' pedagogical competence, attenuated gaps in teacher perception of student IM between students with intellectual disability and learning disability. Including student classroom collaboration variables such as frequency of participation in peer work and classroom discussion to the model reduced disparities in teacher-perceived academic IM between students with autism and learning disabilities."

Return-on-average-assets, shown in the center of each bubble, and stock prices have rebounded impressively since the depth of the financial crisis. But trillions in stimulus spending has done little to revive banks' core mission lending money with the ratio of loans to deposits still falling. The only thing that has consistently grown, in good times and bad, is bankers' pay, represented by the ever-expanding colored circles."
Rehabilitation	"Students with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) increasingly pursue postsecondary education (PSE). Navigating the hidden curriculum including meeting prerequisites for PSE and employment, using support systems and community transportation, and carrying out adulthood expectations is an area of challenge. This exploratory case study examined experiences of students with IDD attending a PSE program and stakeholder perspectives. Thirty-two participants (10 students with IDD, 5 parents or guardians, 4 college administrators, 8 college instructors, 4 occupational therapists, and a transition specialist) were interviewed. Conventional content analysis revealed navigating the hidden curriculum as a key theme and three subthemes: (1) adult-based system navigation, (2) persisting challenges with adaptive behaviors, and (3) disability awareness and disclosure. Limited awareness of disability and supports and services needed for a successful PSE outcome were contributing factors. Occupational therapists have the skills to support students with IDD in skill acquisition to successfully transition to and navigate PSE and the hidden curriculum."
Family Studies	"This article examines the relative impact of religious factors on Americans' attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples. Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for same-sex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant. Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists, those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption. Findings suggest that religious affiliations matter less for predicting same-sex adoption attitudes than how Americans practice and hold their faith."
Rehabilitation	"The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of therapeutic Tai Chi on balance, gait, and quality of life in chronic stroke patients. Twenty-two inpatients diagnosed with stroke were divided randomly into two groups: one treated with both general physical therapy and Tai Chi exercise (11 patients) and one treated with only general physical therapy (11 patients). Therapeutic Tai Chi included 10 different movements and was performed for 60 min, twice per week, for 6 weeks. Pretest and post-test measurements were recorded for sway length and sway velocity using Gaitview, the functional reach test, the dynamic gait index, the 10-m walking test, the timed up-and-go test, and SF-36 survey. Both the Tai Chi group and the control group showed a significant improvement in sway length and sway velocity, and the Tai Chi group showed greater improvement than the control group in degree of variation. In addition, only the Tai Chi group showed a significant result for functional reach test, the dynamic gait index, the 10-m walking test, the timed up-and-go test, and the Tai Chi group improved. In the quality of life, the therapeutic Tai Chi group showed a significant improvement in five items (physical function, pain, vitality, general health, mental health) among eight items in SF-36. This study confirmed that therapeutic Tai Chi influences the balance, gait, and life quality of stroke patients. Therefore, therapeutic Tai Chi can be used as an effective exercise in combination with general physical therapy to improve the balance, gait, and quality of life in stroke patients.

"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Statistics producers are increasingly using the web as a mode of data collection. The motives to offer a web alternative lie in data quality and cost considerations. Nevertheless, at Statistics Sweden a surprisingly low proportion of respondents in mixed-mode mail and web surveys chose the web as the mode of response. A preparatory study indicated that participants are inclined to select the mode that is immediately at hand, which in the standard contact strategy applied by Statistics Sweden is the paper questionnaire. Previous research also indicated that simply not including the paper questionnaire in the initial mailout in such a contact strategy may achieve a considerably higher proportion of web responses. Integrating these findings, we conducted a large-scale experiment embedded in a survey, where we varied the timing and order of providing the sampled persons with access to the two response modes (i.e., varied the contact strategy). The proportion of responses completed by web mode was 15 percent in the standard strategy. It was exceeded substantially by all but one of the experimental strategies, reaching 65 percent in the most ""web-intensive"" alternative strategy, showing potential for considerable increase in the proportion of responses completed by web mode. Temporary suppression of the mail mode did affect the overall response rate in some of the conditions, decreasing it by at the most about 4 percent. A cost reduction can be expected if using the ""web-intensive"" strategies."
Law	"This article examines the impact on the patent system of rewards for innovation across the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. During this period, Parliament would regularly grant rewards to inventors, with many of these rewards being set out in legislation. This legislation provided Parliament with the opportunity to promote a model of state support for inventors: a model that made public disclosure of the invention a precondition for assistance. This had important implications for patent law, in particular, in helping to develop the role of the patent specification and the doctrine of sufficiency of disclosure. In this way, the reward system helped establish the framework under which the state would provide support for inventors. Simultaneously, however, the reward system created a space in which inventors would have to do more than meet the minimum requirement of public disclosure. Rewards allowed the state to distinguish between different classes of inventor and to make special provision for particularly worthy individuals. In this way, the reward system recognised the contribution of the ""heroic inventor"", whilst leaving the core of the patent system undisturbed."
Nursing	"The purpose of this study was to identify helpfulness of strategies used by teens growing up in families with Huntington disease (HD). Forty-four participants responded to a mailed HD Family Survey-Teens Strategies. Strategies were those with strong positive correlation between use and perceived helpfulness, and those with negative or inverse relationships. Obtaining information, thinking about or doing something else, and actions on behalf of the parent with HD were rated as highest use and perceived helpfulness. Emotional suppression had high use but low helpfulness. Participants reported using numerous helpful strategies. Social support was often unavailable to help manage teen concerns.

Geography	"Vegetation phenological studies at different spatial and temporal scales offer better understanding of the relationship between the global climate and the global distribution of biogeographical zones. These studies in the last few decades have focussed on characterising and understanding vegetation phenology and its drivers especially using satellite sensor data. Nevertheless, despite being home to 17% of the global forest cover, approximately 12% of the world's tropical mangroves, and a diverse range of vegetation types, Africa is one of the most poorly studied regions in the world. There has been no study characterising land surface phenology (LSP) of the major land cover types in the different geographical sub-regions in Africa, and only coarse spatial resolution datasets have been used for continental studies. Therefore, we aim to provide seasonal phonological pattern of Africa's vegetation and characterise the LSP of major land cover types in different geographical sub-regions in Africa at a medium spatial resolution of 500 m using MODIS EVI time-series data over a long temporal range of 15 years (2001-2015). The Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) technique was employed to smooth the time series data and an inflection point-based method was used to extract phenological parameters such as start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Homogeneous pixels from 12 years (2001-2012) MODIS land cover data (MODIS MCD12Q1) was used to describe, for the first time, the LSP of the major vegetation types in Africa. The results from this research characterise spatially and temporally the highly irregular and multi-annual variability of the vegetation phonology of Africa, and the maps and charts provide an improved representation of the LSP of Africa, which can serve as a pivot to filling other research gaps in the African continent."
History Of Social Sciences	"Studies of the history of the human sciences during the Cold War era have proliferated over the past decade-in JHBS and elsewhere. This special issue focuses on the connections between the behavioral sciences and the culture and politics of the Cold War in the United States. In the recent literature, there is a tendency to identify the Cold War human sciences with two main paradigms: that of psychocultural analysis, on the one hand, and of the systems sciences, on the other. The essays in the special issue both extend understanding of each of these interpretive frameworks and help us to grasp their interconnection. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between depression and various components of body composition, including fat and muscle, in elderly Koreans. DESIGN: A cross-sectional sample of a longitudinal cohort from the Ansan Geriatric (AGE) Study. SETTING: Elderly people living in urban area (Ansan City, South Korea). PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred thirty-six participants (378 male, 458 female) aged 60 and older were recruited from April 2006 to January 2008. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were examined using the Korean version of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (KGDS). Participants taking antidepressant medications or with a KGDS score of 14 or greater were classified as having depression. Abdominal visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area were assessed using single-slice computed tomography, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and percentage body fat (%BF) were determined using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Elderly men with depression had a lower ASM than those without depression (P = .01) after adjusting for age, body weight, and height. In men, the risk of depression was lower with higher body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio (OR) per 1-standard deviation (SD) increase = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.51-0.96) after adjusting for all confounding variables and higher ASM (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.29-0.85) after controlling for age, height, and weight. Similarly, depression was negatively associated with BMI in women (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.56-0.95). Waist circumference, %BF, and VFA were not consistently associated with depression in men or women. CONCLUSION: Depression in elderly Koreans is associated with low body mass and sarcopenia, especially in men. J Am Geriatr Soc 59:2062-2068, 2011."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article is about food safety and food adulteration in urban India. Situated at the relational interface of foods and their contaminants, it considers ways of thinking and acting at the porous boundaries between bodies and environments. The article details how people attempt to detect where food and its adulteration begins and ends, through ethnographic reflection on several events of adulteration in Mumbai and a context of changing food safety policies in India. The article develops the concept of reliability as a lens onto food politics different than one delimited strictly in terms of consumerism. Reliability refracts the politics of difference at work in times of toxic food environments, in contemporary India and elsewhere, wherein tensions between poison and nourishment take on renewed charges. This framework recasts a choice-focused approach to thinking about food safety by centralizing how living with harm - rather than ridding the world of it, element by element - is what is at stake."
International Relations	"While contingency and negation are relatively well-established notions in the theoretical analysis of international relations, their practical implications remain under-conceptualised. In order to discuss the question of how to act under conditions of contingency and negation, this article, in a first step, triangulates both with Aristotelian noesis. Such triangulation suggests that the consequences of political action cannot be predicted and always have inadvertent consequences due to the contingent and historically and intellectually negated and refutable (even self-refutable) character of politics. It therefore appears as irresponsible to enact policies with interminable consequences. Rather, responsible political action - which is responsible precisely as, and only if, it accounts for contingency and negation - must hence act only in such a way that its consequences are reversible. In a second step, policy theory is critically reviewed in light of reversibility and its underlying philosophical principles, trying to bridge political philosophy and policy studies for a mutually enriched analysis of politics. Such a bridging exercise not only brings enhanced normative reflection into policy studies, but also, in reverse, hints at the crucial aspect of the non-linear unfolding of action consequences, which is, in addition to questions for a future research agenda, discussed in the concluding section. These discussions are understood as a twofold, yet interlinked, contribution: first, to develop a concept of reversibility as a practical response to the philosophical notions of contingency and negation; and, second, to bridge two different paradigms, encouraging the synergy of scholarly expertise for the management of contemporary international and global problems."
Rehabilitation	"The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between perceived percentage of time spent on rehabilitation counseling responsibilities and the possession of an educational degree, certification as a rehabilitation counselor, and years worked for a state or federal vocational rehabilitation agency. A national study was conducted of 483 vocational rehabilitation counselors in state and federal vocational rehabilitation agencies. The results provide evidence that there is little difference in the perceived percentage of time spent on work activities with respect to degree type, certification as a rehabilitation counselor, or years worked for a state or federal agency. Implications for rehabilitation counselors working for a state or federal agency are discussed."
Education & Educational Research	"The successful implementation of creativity in education is largely dependent on teachers' own beliefs about creativity, which have been investigated extensively in the past 25 years. With the growing emphasis of creativity in education, teachers today might not hold the same beliefs highlighted by earlier research. The current systematic literature review sought to identify, describe, appraise and synthesize the most rigorously available recent empirical evidence base on in-service K-12 teachers' beliefs about creativity. 53 studies published between 2010 and 2015 were included in the review. Findings suggest that teachers hold several beliefs that enable and numerous that hinder creativity development in schools. The review also highlighted recurrent incongruence between teachers' positive or adequate beliefs and their enacted classroom practices. Finally, several contextual, student- and teacher-related factors were identified as influencing teachers' beliefs about creativity. Overall, teachers' beliefs were found to be heavily context-dependent. Implications for policy, practice and research are discussed."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"The study assessed care for high-risk pregnancy, including access, functioning, and use of health services, ranging from primary healthcare (PHC) to specialized care. This was an evaluative study anchored in an analytical model that used triangulation of different information sources and comparative analysis of care for high-risk pregnancy in four Brazilian metropolises. The selected analytical categories were: access to consultations and tests, linkage between components of the healthcare networks and between users and healthcare professionals, and the care provided. Contexts of care for high-risk pregnancy were characterized by health system information indicators and a qualitative descriptive study produced by key informants, in addition to a questionnaire applied to 1,886 pregnant women seen at specialized services, having been referred by PHC. Triangulation of data obtained from secondary sources, contextualization of healthcare networks, and a survey with high-risk pregnant women allowed encompassing the complexity of the organizational arrangements in the healthcare network among the municipalities. Significant differences were identified in access, linkage, and care provided for high-risk pregnancy in the four metropolises. Campinas (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) was the municipality with the best performance in the indicators related to linkage and access by pregnant women to PHC. Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul State) showed fair performance on the set of indicators as a whole, while Fortaleza (Ceara State) revealed the need for improvement in the three categories analyzed."
Gerontology	"The United States experienced an unprecedented financial crisis after 2007. This paper analyzes whether retirees had enough wealth built up to weather the financial risks that materialized in the crisis. Financial risks associated with saving for retirement had increasingly shifted onto individuals and away from the public and employers during the decades before the crisis. This growing personal responsibility should have brought about more saving and less risk taking. I use data from the Federal Reserve's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances first to define an income threshold for retirees, specifically whether annuity income is greater than twice the poverty line: a common proxy for basic income needs. I then calculate the potential retirement income that retirees could expect if they translated all of their wealth into income and if the income is adjusted for market, idiosyncratic, and longevity risks. I compare the potential risk-adjusted income for retirees with annuity income above twice the poverty line to those retirees with annuity income below twice the poverty line. Both groups of retirees should have at least the same level of risk-adjusted potential retirement income. This comparison shows, however, that retirees with annuity income below twice the poverty line did not build up sufficient wealth to compensate for the rising financial risk exposure. Public policy thus should maintain existing sources of annuity income, promote greater annuitization of financial wealth, and encourage additional savings."
Health Policy & Services	"The prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients in hospital critical care units has been a target of efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since the 1960s. We developed a historical economic model to measure the net economic benefits of preventing these infections in Medicare and Medicaid patients in critical care units for the period 1990-2008-a time when reductions attributable to federal investment resulted primarily from CDC efforts-using the cost perspective of the federal government as a third-party payer. The estimated net economic benefits ranged from $640 million to $1.8 billion, with the corresponding net benefits per case averted ranging from $15,780 to $24,391. The per dollar rate of return on the CDC's investments ranged from $3.88 to $23.85. These findings suggest that investments in CDC programs targeting other health care-associated infections also have the potential to produce savings by lowering Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"This paper sets out to evaluate the claim that Aristotle's Assertoric Syllogistic is a relevance logic or shows significant similarities with it. I prepare the grounds for a meaningful comparison by extracting the notion of relevance employed in the most influential work on modern relevance logic, Anderson and Belnap's Entailment. This notion is characterized by two conditions imposed on the concept of validity: first, that some meaning content is shared between the premises and the conclusion, and second, that the premises of a proof are actually used to derive the conclusion. Turning to Aristotle's Prior Analytics, I argue that there is evidence that Aristotle's Assertoric Syllogistic satisfies both conditions. Moreover, Aristotle at one point explicitly addresses the potential harmfulness of syllogisms with unused premises. Here, I argue that Aristotle's analysis allows for a rejection of such syllogisms on formal grounds established in the foregoing parts of the Prior Analytics. In a final section I consider the view that Aristotle distinguished between validity on the one hand and syllogistic validity on the other. Following this line of reasoning, Aristotle's logic might not be a relevance logic, since relevance is part of syllogistic validity and not, as modern relevance logic demands, of general validity. I argue that the reasons to reject this view are more compelling than the reasons to accept it and that we can, cautiously, uphold the result that Aristotle's logic is a relevance logic."
Gerontology	"As the size of the elderly population increases, so do the challenges of and barriers to high-quality, affordable health care. The Health and Aging Policy Fellows (HAPF) Program is designed to provide health and aging professionals with the skills and experience to help lead the effort in reducing these barriers and shaping a healthy and productive future for older Americans. Since its inception in 2008, the program has affected not only the fellows who participate, but also the field of health and aging policy. Work needs to be done to sustain this program so that more fellows can participate and sound policies for the elderly population can continue to be shaped and improved. This report describes the HAPF Program, including its background (rationale, description, partners, progress, effect), lessons learned, challenges and solutions, and policy implications."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"We analyse the role of evidence in planning and setting up an advocacy strategy aimed at neutralizing opposition to the adoption of the 1998 Tobacco Law in Quebec. This case illustrates the need to complement traditional epidemiological data with additional information responding to the (mainly economic) objections to the Tobacco Law project. It underlines the importance for public health to partner with actors whose legitimacy enables them to discuss health concerns in the overwhelming public debates.

Environmental Studies	"In this paper, we analyse how and why domestic forest policies in Europe have responded to pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation, climate and bioenergy policies. We use content analysis of documents and interviews to analyse change and stability in domestic forest policy goals, instruments and practices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over time. We find that decision-makers in forest policy and practice responded to pressure to integrate biodiversity into forestry through four different types of policy change outcomes and processes. Depending on the context, these responses included layering, drift, conversion and/or replacement. In all countries, the forest policy changes were driven by (partly shifting) coalitional politics and changes in external conditions. Domestic forest policy regimes shifted from 'timber production' towards 'multifunctional', 'sustainable forest management' or 'biodiversity' primacy, and then back to 'timber harvesting'. Forest policy also integrated bioenergy and climate change policies in order to minimise pressure by EU and national biodiversity policy sectors and to enable 'timber harvesting' (re-)turns in forest policy. We conclude that policy integration processes and the shifts in forest policy they contain refer to a sectoral resilience, that is, the ability of forest policy to react to, minimise, and absorb pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation policies."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"How has the status and practice of collective bargaining evolved since the end of the 1970s? What changes are noticeable in the behaviour of actors? The six countries included in this study - Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Sweden - have original industrial relations systems. Economic and social disruption is driving changes, at the same time that Europe is under construction. The difficulties arising from the prolonged economic crisis neither deconstructs these systems, nor eliminates their diversity. The actors are adaptable and play on a historically based social acceptance to maintain their influence. They invest in new areas and new spaces for exchange (European Works Councils, social pacts). Indeed, in an apparently rational and effective response to the crisis, collective bargaining sees its status somewhat enhanced and its remit intensified - in the Continental European countries. Great Britain is the exception; the head-on challenge to the collective bargaining system and union power is in contrast to the common trend in the other countries. Progressively, collective bargaining is regarded as being at the core of industrial relations; collective actors identify with their role as negotiators. The dissolution of old alliances between unions and parties has started a movement which is little discussed; the depoliticization of the union project and a recentring within the industrial relations space. With the 21(st) century, contradictions emerge. The actors, both employer and union, lose their power of representation and integrative capacity. Negotiating systems lose their effectiveness; states bypass them as well as their actors in order to bring about social changes. More than a system crisis, we are dealing with a crisis of actors. For the unions, it raises the question of revitalizing their ties with their members, through such means as building new alliances."
Communication	"In this article, we present a systematic and structured procedure for sentiment analysis in the news, as well as a database of keywords that incorporate positive and negative opinions toward Israel in different languages. We then mine 14 large newspapers in five countries-the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland-over a period of six months and rate their respective orientations. Unlike those of previous studies, our findings clearly show that news reports are largely critical and negative toward Israel, with British news being the most critical, Italian news the most sensational, and German, French and Swiss news relatively more neutral. Opinions featured in the news are not in line with public opinion as presented in annual surveys of each country. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings."
Environmental Studies	"We examine the benefits flowing from a coastal seascape through seafood trade to various social groups in two distinct small-scale fishery case studies. A knowledge gap currently exists in relation to how benefits from a fishery, and the associated trade, are ultimately distributed, specifically, how market structures and relations, and the combined dynamics of the local fishing society, can mediate these flows. Previous research into improved fisheries governance for food and livelihood security has failed to integrate the structure of the market place as well as the multidimensional nature of actor relations that influence extractive behavior. Using a value chain framework, we take a relational approach to study these gaps. Surveys were conducted in two fisheries (Zanzibar and the Philippines) as part of a comparative analysis including market-types, assistance networks, and income inequality. Chain structures, gender roles, and levels of contractualization within the two cases differed vastly, appearing to give rise to different types of income inequalities and barriers to participation. In the Philippines economic exchanges revolve more around provision of financial capital, although in both systems social standing and obligations play a role in determining market structures. In Zanzibar trading agents engaging customers in predetermined sale arrangements earn relatively more than their counterpart freelancers, however at the production level no income differences are seen between those with or without arrangements. Both cases stand to be further integrated into the international seafood market, which raises questions over how certain actors will benefit, based on their current participation and access. Results emphasize the need for more evidence in regards to benefits flows and how aspects such as gender and transaction forms impact them. This is necessary for governance decisions around fisheries, poverty alleviation, and increased global market integration."
History	"The article deals with the trade relations between Zeta and Dubrovnik, during the reign of the master Durad II Stracimirovic Balsic, starting from 1385, when he came to the throne, until his death in 1403. The economic development of Dubrovnik in the last decade of the 14th and during the first years of the 15th century attracted residents from the towns of Zeta, while, when it comes to the foreign politics, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik were adhering to the principle that when a new ruler or the district governor comes, they would seek confirmation of old privileges. In less than half a year after coming to power in Zeta, Durad II issued a charter to the people of Dubrovnik (January 27, 1386) confirming friendship and old trading privileges. The charter stipulates the legal position of the Dubrovnik and gives new commercial freedom: Durad prescribes that he will compensate for the damage suffered on his territory from his treasury, renounced the benefits from the transit customs in Danja, and guaranteed the protection from robbery and illegal charges, adding that his subjects will not take things from the ships that broke down in the shipwreck along the Zeta coastline and, finally, abolished all salt markets introduced after 1355. Through this charter, the people from Dubrovnik protected their trade, which was largely performed in Zeta and their land. At the same time, the master of Zeta was satisfied by a good cooperation, as the charter encouraged the economic development of his country. Commercial traffic was performed by land and sea. Land routes were divided into: the coastal ones (via de Zenta) and those from the coast to the interior of the country and the Balkan Peninsula (via Jesera). Ships loaded with goods sailed from Dubrovnik to the Adriatic Sea, or, more precisely, to Bar, Ulcinj and the monastery Sv. Srda on the river Bojana. The larger ships from the Adriatic flowed into the river Bojana to the monastery of Sv. Srd, where the market was located, from which the goods were taken over and transported by caravans to the interior of the Balkans. The most important economic center on the coast of Zeta was Ulcinj, and then Bar, while Budva was far behind the importance. The structure of the commodity exchange was as follows: from Dubrovik, grains, salt, fabrics and construction material were exported, and wood, butter (oil) and fish were imported from Zeta. An important factor in commercial traffic was the safety of roads. While working on the relations between Zeta and Dubrovnik, the research showed that the prohibitions and breaks of trade had a special significance. The discontinuation of trade links was most often due to the attack on the Dubrovnik merchants in Zeta (1386 and 1396), the introduction of new customs duties in Danja (1395) and Ulcinj (1396, 1397 and 1403), war conflicts (1392 and 1395) and the plague epidemic (1391 and 1392). Trade relations were not solely limited to goods and transit traffic, since the financial operations were present, as well. The people from Zeta often borrowed money in Dubrovnik, under precisely envisaged conditions. The most common deadlines for repayment of loans were from one to six months. Borrowings ranged from 40 to 300 ducats. According to our compilation, the inhabitants of Zeta, during the period from 1389 to 1396 and 1401 were recorded in 42 pledges. Their total debt amounted to 6,734 ducats, 479 perpers and 148 1/2 grouses. Traders have formed trade companies to unite financial assets, in order to earn profits faster and easier. Profit from trading and damages were usually divided between members of the company on equal shares or according to the invested capital. There were several business associations: the one between Vals and Vlahs from Ulcinj with Utesin Radosaljic (1392), Jurjen Drasinovic from Bar with Ratko Pervanovic from Lopud (1395) and so on. A small number of traders of Zeta gained trading success and wealth in business, and according to the stipulated conditions, they acquired Dubrovnik citizenship. In the period from 1385 to 1403, three groups of traders from Zeta acquired Dubrovnik citizenship. The first group consisted of wealthy traders, only one of their generations worked for a short or longer period in the city of Sv. Vlah: Stefan Marinov from Ulcinj (15th December 1388), Petar Suma from Drivasta (about 1388), Dinko called Duma Zogotic (around 1396) and Niksa Ratka Milcic (about 1400) from Bar. The second group was made up of rich families that were present in the social life of the Republic through several generations: Desin Nikolic (29 April 1391), Domo Tripetic (28th November 1397), Ivan Pikovic (the beginning of the 15th century) and Piero Cagn the beginning of the 15th century) from Bar, Pavle Martinovic (around 1400) and Bartol Marincetic (around 1400) from Ulcinj. The third group was represented by traders from very wealthy families who were received in the order of Antunin: Turcinovic (2nd of January 1389), Stano (1st of August 1388), Stai from Bar (approximate time of arrival in 1400) who originated from Bar, Tripunovic from Ratac and Tano from Ulcinj (1395). Based on the studied archival material from the Dubrovnik Archive we can safely conclude that, in spite of the minor interruptions, trade relations between Zeta and Dubrovnik in the era of Durad 2nd (1385-1403) were characterized by quite good trade relations. Their territorial proximity and business connections have contributed to the mutual economic development and prosperity of this area."
"Business, Finance"	"We analyze high-quality intraday data for KOSPI 200 futures and options to examine a common deviation and regime-dependent price dynamics in the index derivatives markets according to reliability of the common deviation. We find common deviation in the futures and options markets. In terms of the dynamics of asset prices and trading volumes, the linkage between the derivatives (i.e., futures and options) markets is stronger than the relationship between the underlying stock market and the derivatives markets. Whereas the deviations between the derivatives markets and the stock market exhibit an inverted U-shaped intraday pattern, the pattern of the deviation between futures and options markets is relatively flat. The deviations between the derivatives markets and the stock market are tied to trading activities in the same direction. When we identify regimes based on the difference between deviations in derivatives markets, defined as the relative deviation, the common deviation is significantly corrected only when the relative deviation is moderate. Although the stock market does not lead the derivatives markets when the relative deviation is mild, there is a bi-directional information flow between the derivatives markets and the stock market with extreme relative deviation. The result is still consistent in subsample analysis, though we find the informational effect of stocks becomes faint over time. A sudden change in the relative deviation is induced by options trading rather than futures trading. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Criminology & Penology	"Over the past two decades, school resource officers (SROs) have become an increasingly common fixture on the American educational landscape. Despite their prominence in schools, significant investigation into their arrest-making behavior has not occurred. This article uses responses to a statewide survey of SROs in Delaware to explore SRO arrest decision making. Guided by Black's general theory of arrest, it analyzes the effect of the school context on SROs' arrest decisions. The SROs' survey responses indicate that the factors highlighted by Black as influential to arrest decisions remain prominent in SRO arrest decision making, but the school context influences their arrest decisions in a variety of critical ways."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"The relationship between aging, health and healthcare expenditures is of central importance to academics and public policy makers. Generally, it is observed that, with advancing age, health deteriorates and healthcare expenditures increase. This seems to imply that increases in life expectancy would strongly increase both the demand for healthcare expenditures and the number of years lived in poor health. Previous research has shown that such straightforward conclusions may be flawed. For example, it has been established that not age but 'time to death' is the main driver of increased healthcare expenditures at advanced ages. The paper extends this line of research by investigating the relationship between age, time to death and health, the last being longitudinally measured via a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. We propose an approach for modelling the health-related quality-of-life outcome that accounts for both the non-standard nature of this response variable (e.g. bounded, left skewed or heteroscedastic) and the panel structure of the data. Analyses were performed within a Bayesian framework. We found that health losses are centred in the final phase of life, which indicates that future increases in longevity will not necessarily increase life years spent in poor health. This may alleviate the consequences of population aging."
Social Issues	"Focusing on the paradoxes revealed in the multibillion dollar mistake of the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) and the expansive ambit of a leaked National Security Agency briefing on its approach to identity intelligence, this article analyzes security glitches arising from the state's application of mechanized logics to security and visibility. Presuming that a digital-looking pattern would be more deceptive than designs inspired by natural forms, in 2004, the US Army adopted a pixelated digital camouflage pattern, a print that rendered soldiers more, rather than less, visible in the field; it acknowledged this error in 2012. Two years later, Identity Intelligence: Image Is Everything visualized the episteme of National Security Agency surveillance with an illustration detailing hundreds of different types of databiometric, biographic, and contextualthat the agency believes it could exploit to identify and monitor targets of interest. These glitches originate in technofetishistic convictions about the nature of digital images and information, limited ways of imagining bodies and lives, and reductive understandings of complex relationships between power and perception. Together, they expose the paradoxes that arise as the state tries to extend its power over the body and the contingency of that power on the smallest of things."
Environmental Studies	"This paper reviews research on African climate from the major Sahel droughts in the early 1970s to current interest in improving the use of climate science within societal decision-making processes. During the last decade, and particularly since the mid-2000s, the development community has begun to engage seriously with the issue of climate change and its implications for the world's poor. This has led to a growing interaction with the climate research community. Recent climate literature is used to explore four research themes and identify knowledge gaps and areas with potential to adapt climate research for development needs. The first theme considers the development and use of seasonal forecasts and their portrayal by some as a relative success story, but with important skill limitations and need for much greater interaction with users. Forecast use is set within a wider context of generally low scientific understanding of the drivers of Africa's high climate variability and low research capacity. The second theme addresses the main influences on African climate variability and their response to climate change; high levels of uncertainty for future rainfall in some regions where remote influences are poorly resolved in global climate models. The third theme summarizes key elements of climate impacts research and shows a situation of rather ad hoc case studies and little engagement with decision-makers. Recent studies reveal an important move to couple more effectively impacts research with adaptation by focusing on the near future and drawing on current climate-society relationships. The fourth theme looks at the emerging evidence of anthropogenic climate change and secondary effects on African environments and, apart from widespread warming, shows an equivocal situation with evidence for anthropogenic ocean warming affecting regional rainfall. Detection is hampered by data availability and high levels of background variability. Finally, three emergent issues are discussed: (1) reflection on African climate research capacity and international collaboration suggests it is timely to review experiences from recent climate programs in Africa; (2) attempts to untangle climate signals from within complex livelihood systems face significant methodological challenges. These include the need to reconcile scientific observations and local perceptions and to clarify views that may over-simplify climate-society interactions, to avoid construction of a crisis narrative on Africa and climate change; (3) the challenge of linking climate science with decision-making to inform adaptation. Demand for information and confidence often exceeds what climate science can realistically achieve in many parts of Africa. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Environmental Studies	"In the late 2000s, slaughterhouses across the Amazon entered into a series of agreements designed to reduce the environmental impact of the local cattle sector. In this research, we analyze the impact of these agreements using a novel dataset showing the location of cattle vaccinations in 2014. In total, we estimate that more than half of the cattle herd in Novo Progresso was vaccinated on ranchlands which were either located in protected areas, were deforested since the agreements were put into place, were subject to an official embargo due to a violation of environmental or labor laws, or were not registered in the state of Para's Rural Environmental Registry. The results suggest that hundreds of thousands of cattle continue to graze on areas in Southwest Para which were meant to be excluded, per the terms of the recent cattle agreements, from the supply chain in a key Amazon cattle frontier. Our results highlight the importance of developing new systems for monitoring cattle supply chains in remote areas of the Amazon."
Economics	"Game theory has been a huge success in economics. Many important questions have been answered, and game theoretic methods are now central to much economic investigation. We suggest areas where further advances are important, and argue that models of learning are a promising route for improving and widening game theory's predictive power while preserving the successes of game theory where it already works well. We emphasize in particular the need for better understanding of the speed with which learning takes place."
History Of Social Sciences	"This paper examines a key period in the history of Birmingham, a city that was extensively though diffusely bombed during Second World War, but was redeveloped according to Modernist-inspired planning principles in the post-war years. Investigating the 'piecemeal' reconstruction of Birmingham's city centre in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, it is argued that the narrative of redevelopment has been thoroughly captured in official accounts which offer a detached view removed from the realities of everyday life. Although there is acknowledgement that encounters between human subjects and conceived spaces are multifaceted, few studies have examined this empirically within the context of the 'Modern' city. Drawing on a series of oral history interviews with residents to elucidate citizens' experiences of this phase of redevelopment, this paper shows that inhabitants often doubted and opposed (and occasionally praised) the planners' conception of space as they attempted to re-orientate themselves to the rhythms of everyday life in the 'new' city centre. The paper accordingly concludes that the process of modernization provokes an uneasy co-existence between representation and experience and that there is a need for a broader methodological pluralism in studies in an effort to understand the dynamic relationship between people and the physical environment."
Area Studies	"Air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels in developing counties is a global challenge due its climate change and health effects. Dirty fuel and air pollution have become a serious issue in many Central Asian countries. This article studies the factors that affect household decisions to transition from dirty energy to clean modern fuels using panel data from Kyrgyzstan. The article argues that the choice of fuel depends on a number of endogenous and exogenous factors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of the ""energy ladder"" hypothesis, high income does not lead to a full switch to modern fuel, but rather facilitates the transition to consumption of energy from multiple fuel sources. Factors that increase the chances of full fuel transition are education and access to gas. By contrast, the number of elderly family members and size of the house negatively affect the transition to clean energy use."
Economics	"We consider the determinants and consequences of a source of utility that has received limited attention from economists: people's desire for the beliefs of other people to align with their own. We relate this 'preference for belief consonance' to a variety of other constructs that have been explored by economists, including identity, ideology, homophily, and fellow-feeling. We review different possible explanations for why people care about others' beliefs and propose that the preference for belief consonance leads to a range of disparate phenomena, including motivated belief-formation, proselytizing, selective exposure to media, avoidance of conversational minefields, pluralistic ignorance, belief-driven clustering, intergroup belief polarization, and conflict. We also discuss an explanation for why disputes are often so intense between groups whose beliefs are, by external observers' standards, highly similar to one-another."
Linguistics	"The development of information technology tools opens up new possibilities for analyzing poetry. Such technologies help to more consistently collect, store and automatically process large quantities of new and already existing poetical data. A computer programme, designed to meet the needs of poetry researchers, called Anametre, is at the development stage. We will explore the project's progress and its limits, comparing it with manually collected data, originally gathered to study the verses of Clement Marot."
Women'S Studies	"The year 2012 marked ten years since the end of Sierra Leone''s brutal eleven-year civil war, which had and continues to have a significant impact on girls and women. Sierra Leone reflects the global trend, with women representing a minority of the prison population. With so many competing needs, Sierra Leone often places penal reform low on the priority list of postwar reconstruction efforts. Women in conflict with the law are often seen as perpetrators and thus as less deserving of the limited assistance efforts available than victims, such as women who have suffered gender-based violence. The nature of imprisonment, lack of empowerment, and social stigma make female prisoners and former prisoners nearly invisible, resulting in neglect of their experiences and voices. Building on six years of work with girls and women in conflict with the law, this article seeks to examine the factors behind the growing rates of incarceration of women in Sierra Leone. It explores how marginalization, low socioeconomic status, gender disparities in many areas of social and political life, and weak state institutions result in the law having a particular negative effect on women. The difficult experiences of women in detention and the continuing challenges of reintegration can cause further victimization and have detrimental effects on children. International and domestic gender reform efforts need to incorporate and support this neglected population as part of wider gender justice efforts."
Criminology & Penology	"Unmanned aerial systems (that is, UAS or drones) have been increasingly proposed and used by federal and state law enforcement agencies as an evolving technology for general surveillance, crime detection and criminal investigations. However, the use of UAS technology, in general, and within the particular context of domestic policing activities raises serious concerns about personal privacy and the greater intrusion of new forms of `big brother' surveillance in people's daily lives. On the basis of a national survey, the current study provides empirical evidence on public attitudes about UAS usage in various policing activities. Socio-demographic differences in the public support for drone usage in this context are also examined. Our general findings of context-specific variability in public support for UAS usage in policing operations are discussed in terms of their implications for developing public policy."
Business	"This article studies the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by heritage organizations in southern Europe and contributes to the understanding of how these organizations use technology, an underresearched sector in the management literature but an important one in knowledge society. A multi-case study approach, based on ten reference heritage organizations in France, Portugal, and Spain, generates a theory to identify various types of heritage organization adoption behavior of ICTs and the factors that favor or inhibit this adoption. The authors then test this theory on a complementary sample of 20 other heritage organizations from the same regions. The study characterizes adoption behaviors and influencing factors more precisely. The authors make recommendations to support heritage organizations in their efforts to adopt digital technologies and integrate them in a more meaningful way into their missions.

Rehabilitation	"Purpose: There has been a lack of comprehensive reviews targeting specific aspects of functioning and the difficulties faced by persons with alcohol dependence. The aim of the present review was to systematically compile the existing literature on activity limitations and participation restrictions as defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in the context of alcohol dependence. Methods: A database search (MEDLINE and PsychINFO) was performed for studies published in English (2005-2012), examining the activity limitations and participation restrictions in alcohol dependence. Using a standardised protocol, information about the studies' characteristics and data on activity limitations and participation restrictions, their evolution, onset, determinants and associations with other variables were extracted from the studies under review. Results: A total of 211 difficulties in activities and participation in persons with alcohol dependence were extracted from 125 papers. The spectrum of studies was wide, and their overall quality was good. A common reason for the exclusion of studies was an inconclusive definition of alcohol dependence. Issues with interpersonal interactions, economic and professional life, dealing with aggression and legal problems were the most frequently reported difficulties. Problems with high-risk behaviours and in seeking appropriate treatment were also common. The most frequent determinants of the onset and evolution of the identified difficulties were factors pertaining to the course of alcohol dependence. These difficulties were rarely the studies' focus; therefore, the data on their underlying causes and courses were limited. Conclusions: The results confirm that alcohol dependence profoundly affects the family and social network of the afflicted person. The treatment of alcohol dependence can contribute to the alleviation of these associated difficulties. The ICF offers a new perspective on evaluating the wide range of difficulties encountered in the context of alcohol dependence."
"Education, Special"	"Accessible summary There are a large number of adults with learning disabilities who live with and are cared for by their parents. There is a need for interventions to support older carers with their caring role and to plan for a time when they can no longer continue caring. This research looked at a local support service in England that aimed to support carers over 55 who had an adult child with a learning disability living at home. Twelve carers were interviewed individually. The study highlights the unmet needs of older family carers and shows the value of support from a carer perspective. Background There are a significant number of adults with a learning disability who live with and are cared for by their parents. There is a pressing need for interventions to support older parent carers with their role and to plan for a time when they can no longer continue caring. This article reports on the experiences of older parent carers who have been in receipt of an intervention to support future planning, in a rural part of England, delivered to older carers of their adult children with learning disabilities. Methods Semi-structured carer interviews (n = 12) were conducted and analysed thematically. Results Four themes were identified (a) emotional needs of carer, (b) future planning, (c) accessing other services and resources and (d) links to adult care services. Carers welcomed the flexibility of the intervention and its focus on support for them, relieving their sense of isolation. Conclusions The research highlights the unmet needs of older family carers and shows the value of tailored support from a carer perspective. The findings have implications for national social care provision delivered to carers of adult children with learning disabilities in rural areas."
Development Studies	"This article analyses the Servicios de Administracion Tributaria (SAT), which currently operate in nine Peruvian cities, to show that semi-autonomous tax agencies can play a significant role in strengthening the effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy of decentralised tax systems. Its findings indicate that the SAT collect local taxes and non-tax revenues more effectively than conventional tax administrations, and that, although the SAT model per se does not generate strong incentives for the promotion of efficiency, efficiency may become more important once the SAT are consolidated. Finally, there are hints that the Peruvian SAT contribute to the legitimacy of the tax system thanks to higher levels of transparency and client orientation."
Development Studies	"Examining a classic formulation of the relationship between colonialism and postcolonial nationalisms in postcolonial theory, as well as its recent critiques, this article puts forward a thesis that contemporary colonialisms and imperialisms may be best diagnosed through the lens of identifying forms of sovereignty rather than relying on the geopolitical framework of West/non-West recognisable in the conceptual vocabulary of postcolonial theory. Focusing on the disputed issue of Indian sovereignty over Kashmir, this essay asks the following questions: What forms of occupation by postcolonial nation-states remain concealed by ways in which extant postcolonial approaches assume geopolitical divisions? Why is it necessary to rethink the parameters of imperialism and colonialism for a contemporary era?"
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article critically examines two versions of addiction, the neuroscientific model of addiction as a brain disease and the behavioural model of addiction developed by pain medicine. By juxtaposing these different ways of seeing and acting on addiction, the article challenges the assumption that addiction is a constant and singular entity that can be identified outside a particular context. It also highlights the uses, limitations and tensions of each approach. The molecular gaze of the chronic relapsing brain disease model has the potential to undermine the stigmatization of addicts, while the therapeutic gaze of pain medicine recognizes that changes in the brain produced by long-term drug use are not in themselves pathological. The article suggests that the brain disease model is limited in its scope because it removes addiction from the social context in which it is experienced. On the other hand, the molecular knowledge produced by brain-based research is likely to challenge the ability of pain medicine to maintain clear-cut distinctions between dependence, the drug-seeking behaviour of pain patients and addiction.

Development Studies	"The measurement of poverty is important yet problematic and controversial. This study assesses livelihood asset indicators from the sustainable livelihood approach as a multidimensional inverse proxy for poverty. The study develops and contrasts different asset-based proxies building on the five livelihood capitals: natural, physical, human, social and financial. The Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains with 280 million rural inhabitants and covering 0.47 million km(2) are used as an empirical case to illustrate and contrast the multidimensional proxies, drawing on secondary data for 18 quantitative district-level indicators. Principal components derived directly from the district-level indicators proved to be a good proxy for the district-level poverty head count ratio (adjusted R-2 = 0.51). A composite livelihood asset index aided interpretation but at a significant cost of overall explanatory power (adjusted R-2 = 0.42). Alternative models derived from the five livelihood assets provide more acceptable trade-offs between explanatory and interpretational power. Livelihood asset-based approaches can thus provide an inverse proxy for absolute poverty."
Ethnic Studies	"Thorleifsson examines the ways in which violent imaginaries of Sweden have been discursively constructed and used by populist radical-right (PRR) parties and actors in contemporary Europe. Based on multisited fieldwork among politicians and supporters of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and the Hungarian Jobbik party, this article demonstrates how individual acts of violence are 'transvaluated' into violent imaginaries of migrants from Muslim-majority lands. What Thorleifsson terms 'the Swedish dystopia' not only entails a message of alarm and warning. PRR actors also use the trope of the Swedish dystopia in their call for action against Muslim migrants and minorities who, they claim, pose an ethnoreligious threat to national identity, security and even (Judaeo)-Christian civilization as a whole."
Rehabilitation	"The use of driving simulators is increasing in clinical settings that provide driving evaluation and rehabilitation. To identify the driving simulator scenarios desired by certified driver rehabilitation specialists (CDRSs), we developed a questionnaire consisting of 22 driving scenario situations. A total of 164 CDRSs rated each situation in terms of its importance for inclusion in simulator-based driving. The four situations they identified as most critical were turning left across oncoming traffic, navigating four-way intersections with traffic lights or signs, driving in multiple lanes with traffic on both sides, and reacting to unexpected events that require emergency braking or aggressive maneuvers to prevent an accident. We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to group the 22 driving scenario situations. The model with the best fit included 11 situations forming three factors: (1) Intersections, (2) Roadway and Traffic Conditions, and (3) Environmental Conditions. Future studies should include these factors in driving simulator scenarios and evaluate their clinical efficacy in driving evaluation and rehabilitation."
Substance Abuse	"Three consecutive cross-sectional surveys were conducted among injection drug users (IDUs). Of 2,530 participants, 47.7% reported ever sharing needles, 78.2% having had unprotected sex in the last month, 34.4% not receiving either methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) or HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), 4.8% ever receiving MMT-only, 36.6% ever receiving VCT-only, and 24.2% ever receiving both MMT and VCT. MMT-only and the combination of MMT and VCT had significant associations with needle sharing and on unprotected sexual behaviors. Effectively integrating VCT into MMT services is a logical way to maximize the impact of both interventions on risky behaviors among IDUs."
Ethics	"In this article I ask two questions prompted by the phenomenon of ""politically patterned"" climate change denial. First, can an individual""s political commitments provide her with good reasons not to defer to cognitive experts"" testimony? Building on work in philosophy of science on inductive risk, I argue they can. Second, can an individual""s political commitments provide her with good reasons not to defer to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change""s testimony? I argue that they cannot (at least, in the way identified in the first part of the article), because of the high epistemic standards which govern that body""s assertions. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of my arguments."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a measure of discrimination ability used in diagnostic and prognostic research. The ROC plot is usually represented without additional information about decision thresholds used to generate the graph. In our article, we show that adding at least one or more informative cutoff points on the ROC graph facilitates the characterization of the test and the evaluation of the discriminatory capacities, which can result in more informed medical decisions. We use the rocreg and rocregplot commands."
Criminology & Penology	"Objectives: Criminologists have long been interested in the relationship between subcultural attitudes and antisocial behavior, with Anderson""s street code thesis being the most recent and often researched foray in this area. Relatedly, scholars have begun to investigate the risk factors associated with the anticipation of early death. Extant research, however, has yet to empirically test Anderson""s hypothesis that subscription to the street code is predictive of an anticipated early death. This study contributes to the literatures on the street code as well as fatalism by investigating the link between these two constructs. Methods: Using data from a sample of serious youthful offenders, we examine whether street code values are related to the anticipation of a short life span using a number of multivariate regression techniques controlling for a range of individual- and community-level variables. Results: Results show adherence to the street code is significantly associated with an anticipated early death among the sample of delinquent youth. Further, the relationship between street code and anticipated early death holds across race/ethnicity and gender, and results are not sensitive to the measurement of an anticipated early death. Findings from the current research are discussed, along with implications for policy and future research."
Social Work	"This article discusses the nature of practice in social work and criminal justice. Reporting on a small study involving fifteen experienced probation officers, it considers how they responded to an environment that has changed drastically from the 'clinical' mode of practice in which they trained to the 'punitive managerial' mode of practice in which they were working at the time of the interviews. The study concludes that experienced professionals use their abilities as reflective practitioners to resist the worst excesses of punitive managerialism. Continuing their commitment to balancing the demands of justice and care, they develop a practice that is not merely the straightforward application of technique, but is based upon their relational skills and abilities to develop constructive working relationships with service users."
Development Studies	"Since 2001 (designated as the UN Year of Dialogue Among Civilisations) several initiatives have been developed as a means of resolving problems whose causes have been ascribed, primarily by Samel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, to civilisational difference. This article questions responses to the 'clash of civilisations' thesis which seem to accept the postulates on which it is based. It suggests that while dialogue is an indispensable tool of social cohesion, the source of many of the problems that pose a continuing threat to regional and global order is not 'civilisational difference' but the failure of governments to comply with international laws and conventions they have sworn to uphold. The explanation that 'civilisational difference' is the root cause of global disorder allows them to sidestep responsibility,for the consequences of their own policies. Manipulation of the United Nations at the level of the Security Council is further evidence that the answer to global problems lies in redressing the failings of an entrenched world system that is based far more on power and state perceptions of self-interest than justice. The clearest evidence of structural weakness in the international system is to be found in the Middle East, where the UN Secretary-General's former special representative to the 'peace process', Alvaro de Soto, has drawn attention to the disjunction between public declarations of good intentions and high-level manipulation of this Process' by powerful actors from behind the scenes. The article concludes that where dialogue is not the problem, it cannot be the solution."
Economics	"The demand and supply of electricity must always balance. If supply falls short of demand, then price increases or voluntary demand reductions might help to maintain the balance in the system. Should these prove insufficient, then rationing is necessary. Rationing means interrupting the electricity delivery to certain areas or specific electricity users in order to preserve system stability. Since the cost of an interruption differs among electricity users, the social cost of different rationing mechanisms varies. This paper explores the cost difference between efficient regional rationing (minimizing social costs by rationing regions with low costs first) and random rationing (not taking into account social costs). For this the value of lost load calculations of De Nooij et al. [De Nooij, M., Bijvoet, C.C., Koopmans, C.C., (2007). The value of supply security: The costs of power interruptions: Economic input for damage reduction and investment in networks. Energy Economics, 29 (2). 277-295.] are refined. For the Netherlands, it is shown that efficient rationing can reduce social costs by 42 to 93%. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V."
Criminology & Penology	"This article explores and explains deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. It primarily takes a green criminological perspective and looks at the harm that is inflicted on many of the Amazon's inhabitants, including indigenous populations such as 'uncontacted' tribes of hunters-gatherers, the oldest human societies. The green criminological perspective also implies that the definition of victimisation is being enlarged: not only (future) humans, but also non-humans can be considered victims. Being the most biodiverse place on the planet, deforestation of the Amazon leads to threats and extinctions of animal and plant species. The main causes of deforestation in the Amazon are land conversion for agriculture (mainly cattle, also soy), practices that are mostly illegal. As the products of the (illegally) deforested rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon are mainly for export markets, western societies with large ecological footprints could be held responsible for deforestation of the Amazon."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Meta-analysis is the statistical analysis of a collection of analysis results from individual studies, conducted for the purpose of integrating the findings. Structural equation modeling (SEM), on the other hand, is a multivariate technique for testing hypothetical models with latent and observed variables. This article shows that fixed-effects meta-analyses with the following characteristics can be modeled in the SEM framework: (a) using any type of effect size; (b) including categorical and continuous moderators; and (c) including multivariate effect sizes. Empirical examples in LISREL syntax are used to demonstrate the equivalence between the meta-analytic and SEM approaches. Future directions for and extensions to this approach are discussed."
Ethnic Studies	"In recent years it has become apparent that experiences of integration, conflict, conviviality and prejudice between different ethnic groups can be found not just in towns and cities but increasingly in peripheral, non-urban areas too. While a small, but significant, body of literature has addressed the impact of these trends in rural environments, studies of seaside and coastal areas remain scarce. Burdsey's article responds to this omission through an examination of inter-ethnic relations at the English seaside. The English seaside is portrayed habitually as a white' environment in the popular imagination, and racialized bodies are frequently marked as out of place'. The discussion here highlights challenges to these dominant world-views through growing multicultural settlement in coastal settings, and addresses the implications of these shifts for minority ethnic residents. This is provided through a case studyconsisting of in-depth interviews with and observations of minority ethnic groupsin a particular seaside town in southern England. The data highlight the ambivalent positions of respondents in relation to this setting: feelings of affection and belonging alongside those of structural and spatial marginalization and, most significantly, experiences of racism. Burdsey argues that, theoretically, the geographical and cultural marginality of certain seaside towns helps to explain the type of racialized relations that exist within them. In doing so he reinforces calls for going beyond the dominant urban/rural binary found in much of the literature on race, place and identity towards analyses of out of the way' places."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Proper model specification is an issue for researchers, regardless of the estimation framework being utilized. Typically, indexes are used to compare the fit of one model to the fit of an alternate model. These indexes only provide an indication of relative fit and do not necessarily point toward proper model specification. There is a procedure in the Bayesian framework called posterior predictive checking that is designed theoretically to detect model misspecification for observed data. However, the performance of the posterior predictive check procedure has thus far not been directly examined under different conditions of mixture model misspecification. This article addresses this task and aims to provide additional insight into whether or not posterior predictive checks can detect model misspecification within the context of Bayesian growth mixture modeling. Results indicate that this procedure can only identify mixture model misspecification under very extreme cases of misspecification."
Women'S Studies	"The issue of whether individuals can be traumatized by the experience of rape if they do not label the experience a victimization remains controversial. Indeed, there are conflicting findings with regard to the extent to which such unacknowledged victims experience posttraumatic symptoms. The goal of the current study was to evaluate acknowledgment status as a predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology using structural equation modeling among a sample of 346 college rape victims. Results showed that whereas acknowledged victims reported more symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, acknowledgment status did not add to the prediction of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in a model including assault violence and other important predictors of these symptoms."
Communication	"To what extent can we disassociate the technology and economics of newspapers from their political and cultural functions? Many of the latter functions have survived previous eras of technological change, often with a heightened promise of a more democratic engagement with readers and a subsequent amelioration of civic communication. Toolan (1998) has provocatively suggested that, in their narrative conventions, newspapers often literally do not know what they are writing about. This has partly been because of the time constraints on the production of news and the narrative conventions which this economy imposes upon them. Yet this clearly has not prevented newspapers from having a very strong sense of longer narratives and ideological identities, in combination with an ability to tailor these to a highly conventional notion of audience. What happens when newspapers are freed from this diurnal duty, as is increasingly the case in the contemporary world of newspapers, when more and more breaking news is dealt with by ""quicker'' media? Does this provide newspapers in whatever new formats with the opportunity to reconfigure themselves as spaces more accessible to traditions of communication and civic engagement; ones which draw upon a more discursive space of commentary and opinion on the contemporary rather than being limited to the provision of daily news? This paper sketches an analysis of how the shift of newspapers from news to commentary and identity politics which is already occurring may be informed by previous paradigms of periodical news production. It explores certain aspects of the newspaper's function over time in order to consider what it has to offer in whatever reconfigured technological future."
Social Work	This article reviews social work challenges in treatment engagement of men who have sex with men (MSM) and details issues co-morbidity creates for reaching HIV-positive MSM engaged in substance abuse. The literature reviewed within the article identifies HIV and substance use risk factors influencing out of care dynamics and examines relevant research identifying contextual and cultural factors central to achieving cultural competence. The article examines aspects of cultural sensitivity and competence in service development and engagement and identifies service qualities and characteristics social workers can incorporate into practice and programs to increase the likelihood of successful engagement and treatment adherence.
Sociology	"Our research starts from the assumption that actors use a single decision theory to guide them on how to behave in all possible one-shot two-person encounters. To address which decision theories perform well, we let 17 theories compete in a large number of randomly selected symmetric 2 x 2 games. It turns out that the decision theory that optimizes its own payoff under the assumption that the other actor behaves randomly wins by a small margin. Second, we study the 'evolution of rationality.' In a quasi-biological setup where more successful strategies generate more offspring, the decision theory that always plays the behavior that belongs to the risk-dominant Nash equilibrium emerges as the long-term survivor from an initially mixed pool of decision theories. We also confront the decision theories with human experimental data. The decision theory that always aims for the highest possible payoff for itself performs best against humans."
Urban Studies	"Sunderland, lying on the north east coast of England, is the largest city in the north east of England. Having historically suffered from its proximity to the Tyneside conurbation centred around Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunderland has a long and illustrious history and the city is an interesting one to examine in a City Profile in its own right. In the first instance the legacy of the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation regeneration initiatives from the late 80s and early 90s has been the piecemeal development of unrelated and un-linked projects along the river Wear. Sunderland Arc, the urban regeneration company formed in 2002 by a local partnership to regenerate the city, has had a much broader focus and remit with a clear mandate for redevelopment. This profile examines recent regeneration initiatives and a move from a piecemeal development of disparate sites to partnership working and a more holistic view of regeneration activities, and is a good example of some of the innovative ways in which smaller cities are seeking to re-image and regenerate in response to economic crises.

Management	"Valuable resources often exist at distant points from a firm's current locations, with the result that strategic decisions such as growth have a spatial dimension in which firms seek information and choose between geographically distributed alternatives. Studies show that geographic proximity facilitates the flow of resources, but there is limited understanding of factors that exacerbate or ease the impact of geographic distance when firms seek new resources. This paper argues that the difficulty of search increases with distance, particularly when search involves greater information processing, but that firms can partially overcome the constraints of distance with direct, contextual, and vicarious learning. We study 2,070 domestic acquisition announcements by U.S. chemical manufacturers founded after 1979. The results demonstrate the persistent effect of spatial geography on organizational search processes."
Sociology	"Bridging the literatures on entrepreneurship and the aging workforce, we study the factors, particularly job loss, wealth, education, and risk aversion, associated with entry into self-employment at older ages using a multinomial logit hazard model. Using the Health and Retirement Study, we disaggregate self-employment by defining four types through an interaction along two scopes: one that divides along those with supervisory responsibilities or business asset ownership and the other divided into so-called ""knowledge"" and ""non-knowledge"" occupations. We find that job loss shows a strong association with entry into self-employment, particularly with less desirable forms of self-employment. In addition, we show that there are large differences between individuals in these alternative measures of self-employment and that there are distinctive factors that influence entry into these types. Additionally, we show that there are some differences in the factors affecting men's and women's entry into self-employment."
Area Studies	"In June 2004 the Israeli government decided to dismantle all of the Israeli settlements in the Gaza strip. During the year between the government's decision and the implementation of this policy, ardent supporters and opponents of the move sought to sway a divided Israeli public through public relations campaigns promoting their positions. One of the central components of the government's campaign supporting the pullout from Gaza was that it would advance the development of Israel's southern Negev region. Promotion of the policy as a means for development of the Negev tied into Israel's long-standing population dispersal policy, which has been a policy paradigm for land use and development in Israel since the state's founding. This paper examines the way in which development of the Negev was used to advance the Gaza pullout and the degree to which this development was implemented in the years following the pullout. Analysis of the Israeli case is used illustrate the strategic influence of policy paradigms in public policy implementation."
Urban Studies	"This study contributes to the literature on the strength of place attachment, identity, and dependence in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. It also engages the literature concerning the role of sense of place in community engagement and the disruption in place attachment, identity, and dependence that natural disasters can cause. By drawing on interview data collected from residents who returned to New Orleans after the storm and from former New Orleanians who evacuated to Houston but did not return, this article investigates the ""sense of place"" that residents in Ninth Ward New Orleans neighborhoods identify in their narratives about their pre- and post-Hurricane Katrina experiences. The data considered here suggest that returning residents believe that New Orleans in general (and their Ninth Ward neighborhoods in particular) possess a unique bundle of characteristics that, when taken together, cannot be found or replicated elsewhere. While sense of place is an important motivator for returning residents, the data also suggest that complementary factors must be in place if the full potential of this social resource is to be realized."
Linguistics	"This article argues that there can only be one chunk-defining device in grammar: a theory cannot afford to have the same work done twice, once by phases, a second time by prosodic constituency. As it stands, however, phase theory is unable to describe all phonologically relevant chunks; these are too small and too diverse to be delineated. To qualify as the only chunk-defining device in grammar, phase theory therefore needs to be made more flexiblethat is, to be adapted to the demands of phonology. To allow phase theory to describe all phonologically relevant chunks, we propose the separation of the Spell-Out operation from the Phase Impenetrability Condition (PIC). When Spell-Out occurs, every access point may or may not be associated with a PIC at PF, and the same optional endowment with a PIC holds for syntax. This is what we call Modular PIC. Empirically, on the basis of Abruzzese raddoppiamento fonosintattico and data from Bantu, we show that PIC effects in syntax and phonology are entirely independent: a given Spell-Out operation may leave traces in both modules, in either one, or in neither."
"Education, Special"	"There is growing awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the Czech Republic. As a result, there has been an increasing number of diagnoses, more services have become available, and legislation has been developed with regard to practices for children with ASD. In the past, families seeking services to support the needs of children with ASD had limited options. Teaching methodology based on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) for children with ASD was not available prior to 2016. Even though ABA has now reached the Czech Republic, the full extent of its prevalence in the region is unclear. There has been a lack of information regarding the accessibility of services, the details of practitioners, the characteristics of clients, facets of services, its integration with other practices, and challenges associated with its usage. Therefore, the aim of this study was to survey all self-identified ABA practitioners within the region (N = 40) in order to better understand the current state of ABA provision in the Czech Republic. The results show that although there has been a movement towards the increased availability of ABA support for children with ASD, more needs to be done in terms of training and support."
Economics	"This paper analyses the prevalence of 'catastrophic' out-of-pocket health expenditure in Turkey and identifies the factors which are associated with its risk using the Turkish Household Budget Surveys from 2003 to 2008. A sample selection approach based on Sartori (2003) is adopted to allow for the potential selection problem which may arise if poor households choose not to seek health care due to concerns regarding its affordability. The results suggest that poor households are less likely to seek health care as compared to non-poor households and that a negative relationship between poverty and experiencing catastrophic health expenditure remains even after allowing for such selection bias. Our findings, which may assist policy-makers concerned with health care system reforms, also highlight factors such as insurance coverage, which may protect households from the risk of incurring catastrophic health expenditure.

Business	"While we understand well how social media channels sway consumers, there is little understanding of their influence on online trading behavior. We argue that social media are creating a new class of self-directed online traders by simultaneously encouraging and biasing trading decisions. Through an empirical study, we show that heavy social media users are more likely to engage in online trading but are largely affected by online herding behavior, and are four times more likely to blindly follow other traders. Bloggers, influencers, social network contacts, and social media news shape these users"" online trading behaviors. As online traders influenced by social media are unlikely to receive adequate returns, companies face an ethical dilemma: They could leverage social media to efficiently access funds but they risk inappropriately exploiting the inexperience of online traders biased by social media. We offer a set of nine practical recommendations for organizations to respond to these new challenges. (C) 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Business	"Smart technologies are rapidly transforming frontline employee-customer interactions. However, little academic research has tackled urgent, relevant questions regarding such technology-empowered frontline interactions. The current study conceptualizes (1) smart technology use in frontline employee-customer interactions, (2) smart technology-mediated learning mechanisms that elevate service effectiveness and efficiency performance to empower frontline interactions, and (3) stakeholder interaction goals as antecedents of smart technology-mediated learning. We propose that emerging smart technologies, which can substitute for or complement frontline employees' (FLEs) efforts to deliver customized service over time, may help resolve the long-standing tension between service efficiency and effectiveness because they can learn or enable learning from and across customers, FLEs, and interactions. Drawing from pragmatic and deliberate learning theories, the authors conceptualize stakeholder learning mechanisms that mediate the effects of frontline interaction goals on FLEs' and customers' effectiveness and efficiency outcomes. This study concludes with implications for research and practice."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Total employment in the U.S. economy is projected to grow by 15.6 million during the 2012-2022 decade to reach 161 million; this represents a 10.8-percent employment increase. Some of the fastest projected growth will occur in the healthcare, healthcare support, construction, and personal care fields. Together, these four occupational groups are expected to account for about one-third-more than 5.3 million-of all new jobs during this period."
Linguistics	"Linguistic innovations that arise contemporaneously in highly distant locations, such as quotative be like, have been termed 'global linguistic variants'. This is not necessarily to suggest fully global usage, but to invoke more general themes of globalisation vis-a-vis space and time. This research area has grown steadily in the last twenty years, and by asserting a role for mass media, researchers have departed intrepidly from sociolinguistic convention. Yet they have largely relied on quite conventional sociolinguistic methodologies, only inferring media influence post hoc. This methodological conservatism has been overcome recently, but uncertainty remains about the overall shape of the new epistemological landscape. In this paper, I review existing research on global variants, and propose an epistemological model for researching media influence in language change: the mediated innovation model. I also analyse the way arguments are constructed in existing research, including the use of rhetorical devices to plug empirical gaps - a worthy sociolinguistic topic in its own right."
Criminology & Penology	"Management fraud is often explained through wealth-maximization paradigms. This article invokes a different approach, namely a behavioural one, and argues that fraud may happen as a consequence of failures in the decision-making process. Relying on extensive evidence in the case of Parmalat, it maintains that this fraud was not brought about by the desire of the CEO, chairman and founder to maximize his economic goals, but was rather a consequence of his failure to produce an objective description of reality. This was induced by a number of behavioural mechanisms such as self-deception, managerial hubris, emotions and the endowment effect'. This article also contributes to a broader debate on the rationality of economic actors and its limits, and sheds light on the seeds of potential crises contained within genuine Schumpeterian entrepreneurs."
Public Administration	"Homeowners associations (HOAs) are private governments that are reshaping urban governance and service delivery in large parts of the United States. Despite the fact that millions of Americans are HOA members, the field of public affairs has paid scant attention to these new governance entities. The essays in this symposium call attention to HOAs' potential effects on urban services and civic life in the hope of sparking interest among scholars and public managers to include HOAs in our understanding, research, and teaching of contemporary urban governance."
Women'S Studies	"Gender and development being fundamental issues, it is important to emphasise the role of women in rural development, gender-specific approaches to development and women's status in the national and international legal systems. The main aim of this article is to analyse the position of women in Timor-Leste by examining social aspects, with an emphasis on gender roles, the family and the community, access to natural resources and women's status within the legal system and traditional legal structures, with special attention to land and women's land rights. This study is based on documentary sources and studies made by the authors about Timor-Leste. The contribution of the women of Timor-Leste to development is heavily constrained by the degree of gender inequality present in traditional/customary law and social practices, and in-equality of access to natural resources, especially land. In overall terms, we would argue that the Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) is one of the best approaches to guarantee gender equality, and that this approach should be considered in the formulation of rural policies and the creation and implementation of rural development programmes and projects in Timor-Leste."
Cultural Studies	"This article focuses on the discourses in support of refugees as developed in Greece by local grassroots groups. The article theorises the public debate of the refugee issue as taking place in a hybrid media system, in which elites and policy makers, mainstream media, large non-governmental organisations and smaller solidarity groups as well as everyday people participate in unequal ways in constructing this debate and its parameters. In focusing on the solidarity discourses emerging from the grassroots, this article hopes to show how these groups seek to re-politicise the question of refugees, directly countering the (post)humanitarian and charity discourses of non-governmental organisations as well as the racist and security frames found in the mass media and policy discourses. In focusing on Greece, this article shows how two crises, the refugee and austerity crises - both symptoms of an underlying deep structural crisis of capitalism - may be dealt with in ways that overcome dilemmas of belongingness and otherness. In empirically supporting such arguments, the article posits the issue of solidarity to refugees as a research question: what kinds of solidarity do refugee support groups in Greece mobilise? This is addressed through focusing on the Facebook pages of 12 local solidarity initiatives. The analysis concludes that their alternative discourse is not based on spectacle and pity, nor on irony, but on togetherness and solidarity. This solidarity takes three forms, human, social and class solidarity, all feeding into the creation of a political project revolving around ideas of autonomy and self-organisation, freedom, equality and justice."
Linguistics	"Election campaigns represent a particular moment of political practice in democracies where political strategy and political discourse become one activity. Campaigns take effect through the speeches of candidates communicated to the electorate. This article analyses speeches of Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential campaigns in 2007 and 2012. Based on text statistical methods developed in French discourse analysis it examines his political position and his rhetorical techniques. In comparison to other presidents of the Fifth Republic, Sarkozy's discourse seems to be freed from typical party political positions. Whilst favouring direct encounters with the audience and pretending to speak to the whole nation he is embodying a form of populism which bestows his image of a charismatic leader."
Development Studies	"Poverty reduction has emerged as a fundamental social objective of development, and has become a metric commonly used to assess the performance of public policy. This paper adapts the methodology of Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) [2009. ""Unconditional Quantile Regressions."" Econometrica 77 (3): 953-973] to the measurement of the pro-poorness of income growth. The method allows the analyst to identify covariates that affect poverty reduction. The methodology is policy-relevant because policy-makers can better target these covariates than the average level of income, or the level of inequality. We demonstrate this by application to Bangladesh 2000-2010."
Law	"At first glance, sex-offender residency restrictions appear plausible because they ostensibly place a convicted sex offender's residence out of reach of children. However, these regimes address less than ten. percent of the very real problem of child sex abuse, as family members and acquaintances of children commit more than ninety percent of this abuse. On the other hand, many schemes effectively banish almost 100% of convicted sex offenders to society's literal and social margins, condemning many low-risk offenders to a lifetime of isolation while breeding optimal conditions for high-risk offenders to reoffend. The practical implications of this policy choice, therefore, are dangerous and real, lulling the public into a false sense of security. This Article challenges prevailing judicial orthodoxy that many sex-offender residency restrictions are constitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Article applies the analytical framework of Smith v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court's most recent case involving sex-offender legislation. It also forges a new way of thinking about these regimes as land-use policies that ""negatively"" zone individuals out of the urban cores. The Article proposes, fender Containment all innovative ""positive"" zoning scheme, the Sex-offender Containment Zone, Which zones high-risk convicted sex offenders back into the city in a manner that is effective, humane, and constitutional."
International Relations	"Asian waters are geographically positioned as a lifeline for international maritime trade and commerce. Individual coastal state maritime interests aside, there is a legitimate international interest in ensuring international straits are safe for the vast volumes of merchant shipping transiting the region each day. The willingness of states external to the Asian region to become involved when maritime stability is threatened is well illustrated through an examination of the incidence of maritime piracy. The fact that the Asian states, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, bristled at the principally Western interest in seeking enhanced maritime security indicates that at least in this instance, regional cooperation was driven more by a desire to keep Western powers out than a desire to work with neighbouring governments. This article examines the pattern of piracy and the regional initiatives which have been successful in reducing the number of reported incidents. It concludes that not only are effective regional responses to transnational security issues such as maritime piracy and illegal fishing in Asia unlikely, in the absence of intervention from the international community, but that states with sovereign interests at stake in the issue prevent the kind of broader international interest and participation needed to compel more cooperative regional action."
Social Issues	"Third-sector organizations provide essential services, but not all types of organizations operate equally well given different intensities of public problems. This article argues for maps that would help social service funding bodies. Those maps would include three elements: (1) a measure of service demanded by a community, (2) data on the full range of organizations able to supply those services, and (3) a chart that identifies those organizations that provide services at different intensities of need. By providing information about the supply of organizations in a community, with measures of demand for services, state funding bodies, foundations, and individual philanthropists can make informed decisions about where to allocate funds. An ideal map is illustrated by using the case of the Holy Cross Dispute (2001), whereby a host of voluntary sector organizations provided a voice for residents in this divided Belfast community. The result is a call for more intensive mapping exercises of voluntary sector social service provision."
Information Science & Library Science	"Information quality is one of the basis for the survival of organizations and of more competitiveness among them. Therefore, in the last years, researches and studies about the topic have been expanding. The way how to evaluate measurement and improve the information quality, allowing organizations to use and show it with more efficiency and efficacy, has been a topic of research of many authors, who have been proposing empiricist, intuitive, analogical and ontological approaches. The information quality and the information quality processes are analyzed in this work, and especially the evolution of the studies about information quality and its eventual applicability in the market, with the purpose of demonstrating, although its subjectivity, if evaluations about this topic in the organizational context have already been done. Despite the existing critics about the presented approaches, this work intends to emphasize the importance and the need of the evaluation of information quality in the organization, aiming to provide the continuous improvement and the organizational learning."
Criminology & Penology	"Situational Action Theory's principle of the conditional relevance of controls implies that controls only influence behavior when moral barriers have been overcome. The failure of the moral filter to exclude crime from the range of the perceived behavioral options can root both in low personal norm acceptance and in exposure to a crime-affirmative moral context. In detail it is assumed that deterrence only becomes relevant when personal morality is weak, and that self-control only becomes significant when the social setting provides deviant rules of behavior. Both hypotheses are tested with survey data from Ljubljana (Slovenia). The results are in line with the theoretical expectations, thus providing firm support for core assumptions of Situational Action Theory."
Women'S Studies	"In the last few decades, the number of women joining medicine has shown a marked increase all over the world. In India, similar trends are observed though exact data on a nationwide basis is not available, but most women doctors tend to join the disciplines that are less demanding. Concerns about the paucity of research in this area are high-lighted in this note."
Ethics	"Dietary guidelines are mostly issued by agrifood departments or agencies of governments, and are the result of power play between interest groups and values. They have considerable influence over food preferences and purchases of consumers. Ethical problems are at stake not only with respect to power strategies and their influence on consumers. In this paper I will consider three different types of guidelines: a nutrient oriented type (like the Dutch or American ones), a process oriented type (Scrinis in Nutritionism: the science and politics of dietary advice, Columbia University Press, New York, 2013) and a meal oriented type (like the Brazilian one). In the nutrient oriented guidelines healthy nutrients and food stuffs are mentioned that excel in containing one or more 'healthy' nutrients. Bio- and nutrition scientists and the producers of nutrients, like the sugar, dairy and animal industry, have a lot of influence in this variant. The nutrient oriented framing of food is focussed on individual health. Individuals are implicitly addressed to take responsibility for their own long term health; they have to acquire surveillance and cognitive skills in interpreting their bio data. They don't need to acquire skills to cook. In the process oriented type, foods and ingredients are categorized according to minimal, refined and reconstituted production processes. Nutrition scientists have the last say here. Consumers do need some food skills to handle fresh products. In the meal oriented guidelines, politicians, social scientists and fresh food producers have prominent responsibilities with respect to the formulation of the guidelines and their application. Buying fresh products, preparing and eating together are the main themes. Food is framed in terms of cooking, and eating and sharing meals. Consumers have to spend time in buying fresh ingredients and cooking; they have to develop food capabilities. The formulation of dietary guidelines is not a neutral operation, but determined by controversies about framings of food and health, responsibilities and also by integrity and self-confidence of experts. It is striking that biological and nutrition scientists often proclaim to possess the final truth on the healthiness of nutrients, and heap scorn on diet gurus. They don't care that their often incoherent recommendations cause a lot of confusion with consumers and sometimes even lack of trust. I discuss these themes in the paper and will also give some arguments why in the current situation the meal oriented type is ethically more acceptable."
International Relations	"This study is based on the hypothesis that Iranian State's real-political foreign policy practice is constrained by the public opinion which demands more rights and freedoms, thus preventing a balance of violence in the international arena. The introduction explains why Iranian foreign policy is on a real-political axis. The main goal of the study is to question whether the opinion of Iranian public on foreign policy issues affects the Regime's foreign policy For this purpose in the literature review, a detailed definition of real politics is provided, a chronological analysis of different perspectives is made and a theoretical conclusion is given. Following this, the relation between public opinion and foreign policy is discussed. Iranian public poll results are also discussed to draw a picture of contemporary Iranian politics."
Social Work	"This research study explored the perspectives of social work students (n = 118) in the final semester of their studies regarding the implementation of critical social work in their future practices. Using performance ethnographies to collect data, students were asked to share their perspectives about implementing critical social work both in individual interventions and as a way to change the practice of mainstream social work organisations. Research ethnographies were analysed using a descriptive phe-nomenological approach, in an attempt to describe the shared essential experience of participants. Results demonstrated that students are influenced by several lines of thinking that come into direct conflict with one another: (i) they feel that critical social work is essential for individual interventions while also feeling that critical social work is not a priority for individual interventions and (ii) they feel that critical social work should and could change mainstream social work organisations while also feeling that critical social work should not and could not change mainstream social work organisations. These results contribute to a better understanding of the barriers in implementing critical social work, as well as the dilemmas and questions that should be addressed in social work education. Implications for social work education are outlined."
Law	"Historically, administrative law has evolved as a body of law internal to the legal orders of nation states, governing the functioning of the state administrative machinery and its relationships with the addressees of administrative action. But what about global administrative law ( GAL), which regulates the functioning of a vast array of new types of administrations beyond the state? Under what legal order is GAL emerging and consolidating? This short contribution on GAL aims to underline the fact that four main conceptions co-exist in GAL scholarship. They link GAL, respectively, to the legal orders in terms of the sector run by global regulatory systems, to the ""global administrative space,"" to the ""global polity,"" and to the "" global legal order."" Each of these conceptions encapsulates a specific functional and normative understanding of GAL. None of them, however, is fully convincing. In this sense, this contribution intends to draw the attention of GAL scholarship to an unresolved issue and to call for further reflection on the merits and the shortcomings of the various conceptions, as well as on possible alternatives."
Transportation	"The effect of signals at urban intersections is critical in reducing death, injuries, and property loss. Unfortunately, the signal-related factors that can effectively reduce crash frequencies have not been adequately explored. This study investigates the impacts of signal-related, traffic, and highway geometric characteristics on crash frequency at urban signalized intersections. Seven-year crash data from 381 intersections in Illinois, United States of America, was used to estimate a random-parameters negative binomial model. The estimation results showed that a unit increase in the number of signal phases would increase crash frequency by 0.4. Additionally, the ratio of traffic volume on the major road to the traffic volume on the minor road was shown to unambiguously increase crash frequency. On the other hand, the number of approach lanes and the maximum green time of different approaches in a signal revealed an ambiguous effect, whereas increasing crash frequency on 76.33%, and 93.32% and decreasing it on the remaining 23.67%, and 6.68% of the signalized intersections, respectively. Although, this study is exploratory in nature, the results showed that ignoring these factors at urban signalized intersections would lead to the design of ineffective safety-related countermeasures, and the impacts could be underestimated by 5% to 25%."
Ethics	"The early works of Merab Mamardashvili are usually neglected by admirers and critics alike. In this paper, I focus on the very early period of Mamardashvili's development as a professional philosopher putting it in the context of the thinker's interactions with the intellectual community in 1950s and then current discussions about the perspectives of professional philosophy in the USSR. Special attention is paid to a small society of dedicated young philosophers (known as Diastankury) with whom he shared logical and philosophical interests. In the paper, I trace their influence on young Mamardashvili's perception of his own professional tasks in the period when he was busy with the development of dialectical logic. In the final part of the article, I explore the emergence of Mamardashvili's original ideas about history of philosophy and propose the appropriate methods with which to study it."
Environmental Studies	"The subject literature provides knowledge about various contemporary concepts of urban development, emphasizing a variety of goals and priorities of this process. Although sustainability should be a key objective of development policy, the methods of achieving it seem to be diverse. As a result, there are many theories describing development processes on a local scale, but there are no scientific attempts to summarise them or to comprehensively evaluate them. In the presented article such an attempt was initiated - the evolution of the concept of sustainable development in the context of transformation of the role of man in socio-economic and political processes from homo-oeconomicus to homo cooperativus was outlined and the assumptions of contemporary concepts of urban development (smart city, eco city and compact city) were identified and evaluated in terms of their cohesion and implementation of sustainable development principles. On this basis, a conceptual framework for an inclusive urban development model was defined, considering their key values in a synergic way."
Economics	"This paper aims to investigate the predictability of technical indicators to directly forecast oil prices and compare their performances with macroeconomic variables. We find that technical indicators do exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power under OLS regressions and forecast combinations, clearly exceeding that of well-known macroeconomic variables and state-of-the-art oil-macro forecasting variables. Moreover, the strength of the predictive evidence is substantial during recessions and expansions and can detect the typical decline in the oil returns near business-cycle peaks effectively. Furthermore, technical indicators reveal substantial economic value for investors, in terms of superior oil risk premium forecasts and sizable utility gains. The technical indicators' ability to predict the oil price stems in part from its ability to predict changes in sentiment, suggesting the financialization of oil markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nursing	"Healthcare information technology systems are considered the ideal tool to inculcate evidence-based nursing practices. The wound clinical decision support system was built locally to support nurses to manage pressure ulcer wounds in their daily practice. However, its adoption rate is not optimal. The study's objective was to discover the concepts that informed the RNs' decisions to adopt the wound clinical decision support system as an evidence-based technology in their nursing practice. This was an exploratory, descriptive, and qualitative design using face-to-face interviews, individual interviews, and active participatory observation. A purposive, theoretical sample of 14 RNs was recruited from one of the largest public tertiary hospitals in Singapore after obtaining ethics approval. After consenting, the nurses were interviewed and observed separately. Recruitment stopped when data saturation was reached. All transcribed interview data underwent a concurrent thematic analysis, whereas observational data were content analyzed independently and subsequently triangulated with the interview data. Eight emerging themes were identified, namely, use of the wound clinical decision support system, beliefs in the wound clinical decision support system, influences of the workplace culture, extent of the benefits, professional control over nursing practices, use of knowledge, gut feelings, and emotions (fear, doubt, and frustration). These themes represented the nurses' mental outlook as they made decisions on adopting the wound clinical decision support system in light of the complexities of their roles and workloads. This research has provided insight on the nurses' thoughts regarding their decision to interact with the computer environment in a Singapore context. It captured the nurses' complex thoughts when deciding whether to adopt or reject information technology as they practice in a clinical setting."
Information Science & Library Science	"The goal of the research here presented is to identify which aspects of Wikipedia can be exploited to support the process of automatically building Multilingual Domain Modules from textbooks. First, we have defined a representation formalism for Multilingual Domain Modules that is essential for Technology Supported Learning Systems which aim to serve a globalized society. To our knowledge, no attempt has been made at achieving domain models that consider multiple languages. Our approach combines Multilingual Educational Ontologies with Learning Objects in different languages. Wikipedia is a valuable resource to accomplish this purpose. In this scenario, we have developed LiDom Builder, a framework that uses Wikipedia as an additional knowledge base for the automatic generation of Multilingual Domain Modules from textbooks. The framework includes domain-independent term extraction methods to identify which topics of Wikipedia are related to the domain to be learnt and, also, extracts their equivalents in other languages. In order to complete the Educational Ontology, we have defined a method to extract pedagogical relationships from Wikipedia and other general-purpose knowledge bases. From this task, we highlight the extraction of relationship that will allow the sequencing of the topics in Technology Supported Learning Systems. In addition, LiDom Builder takes advantage of the structured contents of Wikipedia to identify text fragments that can be used for educational purposes, classifies them and generates their corresponding Learning Objects. The interlanguage links between topics of Wikipedia are used to create Learning Objects in other languages."
Social Issues	"This article sketches the development of the organized, interdisciplinary, global field, and emerging academic discipline of altruistics, focusing on academic journals and mainly on researcher associations founded since the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA) in 1971. About 55 similar interdisciplinary altruistics researcher associations have been founded worldwide (48 described here; including 9 defunct), 25 of them national in geographic scope, but seven covering a world region and 11 global. Over 100 academic journals that publish research on altruistics or its sub-topics have been published, with 95 active ones described here. The author estimates that there are at least 8,000 active altruistics researchers worldwide, and perhaps as many as 20,000. The author devised the neologism altruistics (or alternatively, voluntaristics) to refer to all the phenomena of our field, individual and collective. Included are philanthropy, nonprofit sector, third sector, voluntary sector, civil society, social economy, volunteering, associations, and nonprofit organizations, among other topics. The term is similar to the term linguistics."
Health Policy & Services	"Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) treatment for children requires growth hormone injections, typically administered daily until the child reaches adult height. Child GHD treatment burden is not well understood and no disease-specific measures exist to assess this burden. The purpose of the study was to explore GHD treatment burden for children and their parents by conducting concept elicitation interviews supporting a theoretical model of the impact of GHD treatment. Four focus groups (in Germany) and 52 telephone interviews (in the UK and USA) were conducted with children/adolescents with GHD aged 8 to < 13 years and parents of children with GHD aged >= 4 to < 13 years. The purpose of the interviews was to understand the experience of GHD treatment from the child's perspective, and for parents, the impact of their child's treatment on themselves. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically based on modified grounded theory principles. Interviews with 70 respondents who produced descriptions (n = 73) of patients experiences with GHD treatment (three parents spoke for two children each) were conducted. Analysis identified three major areas of GHD treatment burden for children: physical; emotional well-being; and interference. Parent burdens identified were: emotional well-being and interference. Modifiers such as treatment efficacy and duration, which may impact the degree of treatment burden severity, were identified. Overall treatment burden of child GHD is considerable for children and their parents. The concept elicitation and theoretical model can be used to develop a disease-specific outcome measure, which adequately reflects the burden of GHD treatment for children and their parents."
Ethnic Studies	"In the last two decades, the concept of multiculturalism has come under attack in political and academic discourses. Simultaneously, European governments have accommodated key aspects of multicultural policies, both nationally and internationally. In academic debates, it has been suggested that multiculturalism' can be replaced by interculturalism'. This paper responds to those suggestions. We argue that, while liberal state multiculturalism risks essentializing minority groups, critical multiculturalism as a social movement refers to minority struggles to be recognized as equals in relation to the majority. Interculturalism as policy opens up a space for dialogue where minoritized people, individually and collectively, can find their own voices and negotiate their own identities and interests as well as the shared values of larger society. While multiculturalism is partly about legal rights and policies, it is also about possibilities for participation, opening up public spaces for dialogue and negotiations where the voices of minoritized groups and individuals are heard, providing an opportunity for living together in a diverse society marked by mutual understanding and adjustment. We conclude with the suggestion that intercultural dialogue should be combined with critical multiculturalism. In other words, the theory and practice of intercultural dialogue need to go beyond liberalism and take into account critical multiculturalism's emphasis on the positionality of all perspectives. A theory and practice of genuine intercultural dialogue cannot ignore power relations, the empirical fact that some people speak from above' and others from below'."
Social Work	"There is a vast academic literature on the moral dimensions and ethical dilemmas of what are commonly referred to as the helping professions (e.g., nursing, medicine, social work, counseling, teaching). Over the past several decades, increasing attention has been paid to the issue of moral transgressions perpetrated, witnessed, or experienced by these professionals and their accompanying psychological and social outcomes. Scholars seeking to understand moral transgressions and their effects have proposed and examined a variety of constructs, including moral distress, demoralization, and moral injury. This article examines to what extent constructs related to moral transgressions and their associated psychological, emotional, and social effects overlap and diverge to describe similar or distinct phenomena and proposes a unified conceptual model of moral suffering. Understanding the moral dimensions of the helping professions is critical for effective research and just, ethical practice."
Political Science	"This article discusses possible issues of how media content and exposure were linked in previous research. It argues that the original conclusions of the article 'Who's Afraid of Conflict? The Mobilizing Effect of Conflict Framing in Campaign News' do not hold due to the chosen operationalization. It also demonstrates that using the proposed methodology, both exposure to conflictual and non-conflictual news yield the same substantive conclusion. In addition to re-evaluating the role of conflict, the article contributes to the discussion on how to integrate media and individual-level measures in the study of electoral behavior."
Women'S Studies	"Menstruation, an essential and healthy biological function, is cloaked in a culture of silence. Sociocultural norms at the family and community level play a pivotal role in shaping how young unmarried women understand and manage their monthly period. Less is known about how unmarried young women living in low-income urban areas in India seek help for their menstrual needs. This qualitative study seeks to understand how young unmarried women (aged 15-24) living in a slum settlement understand menstruation and perceive menstrual problems, and identifies factors that influence their help-seeking behaviour for menstrual needs and problems. It also proposes recommendations for national health programmes addressing menstrual health and hygiene. The findings echo previous research findings emphasising young unmarried women's low levels of awareness and misconceptions about menstruation. These girls perceived menstrual problems as a key concern, as it significantly interfered with their daily routine and caused emotional distress. Young women's ability and willingness to seek help to address menstrual needs is influenced by a culture of silence that surrounds menstruation, excessive scrutiny and blaming by the community, and restrictions on their mobility and interactions with peers. The findings underscore the role of mothers as gatekeepers who greatly influence young women's perceptions of menstruation and menstrual problems and their ability to seek help. Existing interventions need to be expanded to address young women's need for emotional and social support, and to involve significant gatekeepers such as mothers in promoting the health and well-being of young unmarried women in slum communities. Intervention strategies should be expanded to enhance the capacity of mothers to recognise, understand and address their teenage daughters' needs for information, emotional support and access to essential clinical and social services."
Business	"This study explores whether absorptive capacity, one of the most important concepts in the literature on inter-partner learning and innovation in alliances, can be directly transposed to cross-sector alliances. The results of the analysis suggest that current models of absorptive capacity only imperfectly reflect the learning and innovation dynamics characteristic of cross-sector alliances, due to differences in alliance partners, their goals, and the type of innovations they pursue. This article introduces the concept of relational capacity for Social Innovation, a model better suited to the analysis of learning and innovation in the context of cross-sector alliances, especially those operating at the base of the economic pyramid.

History & Philosophy Of Science	"On rationalist infallibilism, a wide range of both (i) analytic and (ii) synthetic a priori propositions can be infallibly justified (or absolutely warranted), i.e., justified to a degree that entails their truth and precludes their falsity. Though rationalist infallibilism is indisputably running its course, adherence to at least one of the two species of infallible a priori justification refuses to disappear from mainstream epistemology. Among others, Putnam (1978) still professes the a priori infallibility of some category (i) propositions, while Burge (1986, 1988, 1996) and Lewis (1996) have recently affirmed the a priori infallibility of some category (ii) propositions. In this paper, I take aim at rationalist infallibilism by calling into question the a priori infallibility of both analytic and synthetic propositions. The upshot will be twofold: first, rationalist infallibilism unsurprisingly emerges as a defective epistemological doctrine, and second, more importantly, the case for the a priori infallibility of one or both categories of propositions turns out to lack cogency."
Cultural Studies	"In late 2004, the concept of the creative industries arrived in China. It was warmly welcomed in Shanghai and then subsequently adopted with some degree of caution in Beijing. In the years since, officials, scholars, practitioners, entrepreneurs and developers have exploited the idea of creative industries, and a range of associated terms, to construct an alternative vision of an emerging China. In 2009, Li Wuwei, the director of the Shanghai Creative Industries Association, himself a leading player in national political reform, released a book titled Creativity is Changing China (Chuangyi gaibian Zhongguo), subsequently translated as Creative Industries are Changing China in English. The paper investigates the uptake of the creative industries in China and asks: Can they really change China, or are they just rearranging the cultural landscape in some cities?"
Women'S Studies	"Condom use resistance (CUR) through coercive tactics is a significant public health concern. The present study investigated CUR risk factors through an alcohol administration experiment using a sexual risk analog with a community sample of male nonproblem drinkers (N = 321). Utilizing a path analysis framework, results demonstrated that men with more severe sexual aggression histories displayed stronger in-the-moment power and control responses, which was associated with greater coercive CUR and unprotected sex intentions. A significant interaction between sexual aggression history, risk rationale, and alcohol condition also predicted coercive CUR intentions. These findings emphasize the relationship between sexual aggression and sexual risk behaviors and highlight the importance of targeting these constructs in intervention and prevention efforts."
Communication	"This study examines the rationalisation of the news frames of currency-related international economic interaction by analysing news articles from the ""China Focus"" column in China""s state-run Xinhua News Agency. Thematic analysis of the main themes in the news articles shows dominant positive coverage of China""s economic development. Using qualitative content analysis, it also investigates the breeding of the ""emergence"" of constructive journalism practices in China. It finds that Xinhua prioritises the frames of referring to solutions to the conflict and problem and mentioning the social and economic stability, sustainability, and prosperous development. The frames of moral judgement, conflict and its formation, and human interest are less applied in news articles. It bears elements of constructive journalism, but still needs efforts to make a clear division from positive journalism and Party journalism."
Law	"Article III requires federal judges who exercise federal jurisdiction to be given life tenure and undiminished compensation, limiting Congress's ability to influence the judiciary. But from the beginning, we have accepted certain forms of adjudication outside Article III - state courts, most obviously, but also territorial courts, administrative adjudication of public rights, and military tribunals. The question is why. This Article attempts to provide an answer. It argues that it is a mistake to focus on the act of adjudication itself; adversary presentation about the application of law to fact is simply a procedure, and not a procedure uniquely limited to Article III courts. Instead, the constitutional question is one of government power. What kind of power has the tribunal been vested with, and what is it trying to do with that power? With this framework in view, the structure and scope of non Article III adjudication becomes clearer. Some courts exercise the judicial power of some other government. This is why territorial courts and state courts are constitutional. Some bodies exercise executive power, subject to the constraints reflected by the Due Process Clause. This is why administrative adjudication of public rights and military trials are constitutional. Some exercise no governmental power and can proceed only as an adjunct to another entity or on the basis of consent. This is the only basis on which magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges can proceed and may render some of their current behavior unconstitutional."

Health Policy & Services	"Objective: This study applies Lean Six Sigma (LSS) to improve the efficiency of a private hospital day care unit and generate a positive impact on optimizing nursing time and improving personalized patient care and staff satisfaction. Design: A prospective interventional study using pre- and post-evaluation. Setting: A day care unit at a private hospital. Participants: Nurses and patients from the day unit. Intervention(s): Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control was used as an overarching problem-solving framework. All front line staff, clinical leaders and managers were supported as active change agents in the quality improvement (QI) initiative. Multiple interventions were adopted across the service that aimed to de-implement non-value added activities and enhance processes with activities that added value. Main outcome measures: Patient turnaround times (PTTs), nursing time, nurse-patient ratio, nurse and patient survey. Results: A post-implementation evaluation highlighted significant improvements in service performance and patient and staff satisfaction. Significant added value includes a reduction in PTTs, an increase in nursing care time and improvement in the nurse-patient ratio. Conclusion: This project identified that utilizing LSS that relies on collaborative team effort is effective in creating a positive organizational culture for improvement and change. The Six Sigma tools and techniques provide evidence-based approaches that support QI in practice."
Social Work	"With an aging population who wish to remain living in the community, this article explores the experiences and benefits of receiving volunteer services from a home support program established to assist people with increasing needs to remain living independently. Face to face interviews explored how the services of informal carers (volunteers) provided through the program made a difference to the daily lives of 16 recipients. Improved life satisfaction was identified through the themes of being helped with daily activities, positive human contact, and fear of a poorer quality of life. It was found that addressing recipients' social, emotional, and mobility needs supported them to remain living at home."
Information Science & Library Science	"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to help understand consumer acceptance of online health information services by integrating the health belief model and extended valence framework. Design/methodology/approach - A laboratory-based, experimental-scenarios research design is used to collect data, and the structural equation modeling technique is used to test the research model. Findings - The model explains 47.6 percent of the variance in intentions to use online health information services. Trust appeared to have the strongest effect on acceptance. Perceived risk also had a significant impact on acceptance. Furthermore, health belief variables are confirmed as important factors for consumer acceptance. Self-efficacy was found to moderate the effect of perceived severity on acceptance. Research limitations/implications - This study helped identify the relative salience of the health belief model and extended valence framework in consumer acceptance of online health information services. Practical implications - This study can help practitioners better understand the development of trust and the profiles of consumers who may browse their sites. When online health service providers promote their information to encourage potential online health information seekers, they should use countermeasures against risk perceptions. Originality/value - This study attempted to extend the valence framework to the non-commercial service context. Moreover, health beliefs and the valence framework are two fundamental aspects that health information seekers consider when making decisions about online health services."
Criminology & Penology	"This article analyses the finances for and the finances from corporate bribery in international business transactions and how they are organized. Transnational corporate bribery involves non-criminal commercial enterprises that operate in licit markets but that use corrupt means to win or maintain business contracts in foreign jurisdictions. This article first considers what needs to be financed, how much finance is needed, and how the bribes can be generated and distributed. Second, the article considers the different forms of proceeds that emerge out of the bribery, how offenders must conceal the derivation of funds from these crimes while also retaining control over them, and how they must overcome particular obstacles. Finally, the article discusses responses to the proceeds of bribery and related anti-money laundering provisions, before analysing actual and potential mechanisms for intervening with the finances for and from transnational corporate corruption."

"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This paper studies the impact of high-speed rail on travellers"" behaviour in China through the study of travellers"" characteristics and their satisfaction with the railway. A sample of 328 passengers from the Shenzhen-Xiamen Railway (XSR) is surveyed by questionnaires. The results confirm that the XSR development has partly changed the respondents"" decision to take the railway or choose its tourism-related products. Socio-demographic characteristics including age, occupation, monthly personal income, and annual travel expenditure show a significant influence on the changed travel behaviour though the tendency of such influence is not very apparent. Convenience and comfort lead to travellers"" satisfaction and these two aspects shorten the duration of stay of travellers and provide more short-haul rail-connected destination options. However, railway satisfaction is not highly associated with XSR-related product and service provision, but is related to the condition and the quality of the railway itself."
Communication	"This article discusses developments in French public policy towards videogaming in the 2000s, and explains them by locating them within the context of French cultural policy during the Fifth Republic (especially since the 1980s), and evolving interpretations of what kinds of activities can contribute to France's 'cultural presence' in the world."
History	"This article explores the unique relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee that lies at the heart of collaborative oral history, specifically in relation to life story research with people with intellectual disabilities. It is concerned with interrogating this relationship and how this form of collaboration can be represented. This article argues that amplifying the voice of people with intellectual disabilities is a fraught exercise primarily because life stories occupy an uneasy ground somewhere between biography and autobiography. Using examples of two self-reflexive life stories of two adults with intellectual disabilities, we argue that a certain measure of self-reflexivity in the presentation of life stories of people with intellectual disabilities can enhance the story that is told."
Public Administration	"Although the public-management literature has demonstrated a growing interest in public-nonprofit collaborations, it pays little attention to the sustainability of collaborations. This study proposes that nonprofits' intentions to maintain collaborations with government are influenced by both instrumental and relational factors. Using a national sample of human service nonprofits, this study demonstrates that both nonprofits' continuance commitment and affective commitment play a role in shaping their intentions to maintain collaborative relationships with government. Specifically, continuance commitment is driven by the presence of a formal agreement and the dependence on government funding, and affective commitment is shaped by distributive and procedural justice. The findings have implications for public managers to effectively manage their collaborations with nonprofits."
"Education, Special"	"This study examines the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between reactive and proactive aggression and children's peer status. Participants were 94 Dutch elementary school-aged boys in self-contained special education classrooms for students with emotional/behavioral disorders (EBD) and 47 boys with no disabilities in general education classrooms. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses were conducted to test how aggression, context, and their interactions predicted participants' peer status, which encompassed social preference and social impact as indicated by classroom peers. Descriptive analyses show that both reactive and proactive aggression were more common in EBD classrooms. Classroom type moderated the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between subtypes of aggression and social preference. The results indicate that to understand the relationship between aggression and children's peer status, it is important to analyze the specific type of aggressive behavior and the context in which it occurs. These findings also suggest the importance of students and teachers' responses to aggression in reducing aggressive behavior."
Development Studies	"This article analyses the impact of Fair Trade certification by focusing on its interactions with the patronclient relations traditionally established between management and workers in tea plantations in India. It argues that the invisibility of Fair Trade among workers, which generally reinforces existing patronclient relations through Fair Trade premiums, inversely hides the patronage of the management, and that workers are empowered when a premium is invested in a community development project led by an independent third-party organisation."
Sociology	"The European Veterinary Code of Conduct recognizes the crucial role of veterinarians in improving animal welfare and maintaining its standards. However, several studies have claimed that veterinary students' attitudes toward animals may worsen as they progress through their academic training. This study aimed to investigate students' attitudes toward nonhuman animal use in three European veterinary medicine schools (Italy and Spain). For this purpose, 565 veterinary students completed a questionnaire consisting of a range of items grouped into four animal-use categories: ""Research,"" ""Entertainment,"" ""Utilitarianism,"" and ""Veterinary Issues."" Items were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with higher scores indicative of higher concern regarding animal welfare. Results showed that the use of animals for ""Entertainment"" and questions related to ""Veterinary Issues"" raised the most concern among the veterinary students, while the use of animals for ""Research"" was of least concern. Moreover, we also examined some potentially confounding factors: age, academic year (first to fifth), gender, previous experience with pets, and university. Female students had a higher concern for animal welfare compared with their male counterparts. Students in their earlier stages of training as veterinarians also exhibited a greater concern for animal welfare compared with those of later academic years. Other factors affecting students' attitudes toward animal use were the age of the students and the university they were enrolled at. The findings of this study confirm that attitudes toward animal use are not homogeneous and are associated with students' demographic, educational, and personal characteristics."
Cultural Studies	"The analysis of the link between emotions and art has an established place in the humanities. What attracts interest is, to equal degrees, the emotions experienced by both creators and the audience and the symbolic forms of emotion representation present in artistic realisations. Five independent theoretical models of emotion are currently discussed in psychology. The article is a creative attempt to explore various ways of representing emotions in works of art, consistent with the assumptions of these models. This suggests new ways of interpreting a work of art as a vehicle of emotional contents that go beyond elementary aesthetic experiences, organised from biologically conditioned responses to culturally developed symbols. These links have been illustrated in the works of British artist Damien Hirst."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Counterfeiting and the sale of substandard pharmaceutical products can no longer be ignored. At 10% of global trade, counterfeiting is affecting many countries, causing serious downstream expenses and resource shortages. Objective: To describe the nature and impact of drug product counterfeiting and substandard product sale and to present strategies that may have value in ameliorating these phenomena. Methods: A literature review was conducted, supplemented by interviews of key leaders/experts in the field and the search of relevant web sites. All of the data were combined, integrated, and coordinated to present the complete picture of this problem. Results: In addition to known corruption in some of the least developed countries, the trail through developed countries was detected. This report identifies means to detect faulty products and describes efforts toward resisting and ending these corrupt practices. Conclusions: Counterfeit drugs, if not stopped, can be responsible for a macroeconomic pandemic where major portions of some populations may be too ill to work and where the health sector resources are completely overwhelmed, as with the case of HIV/AIDS.

Communication	"This study aimed to advance theoretical and practical knowledge of political public relations and mediated public diplomacy through analyzing the agenda-building relationships between state-owned media and foreign news coverage in 16 countries during the 2014 Hong Kong protest. The results indicated significant correlations of issues and stakeholders between the Chinese state-owned media and the English language media outlets of 16 foreign countries, thereby supporting the international agenda-building role of Chinese state-owned media. An exploratory analysis was conducted to test the role of intercultural or international relations variables in the agenda-building process."
Development Studies	"This paper considers whether trade between China and sub-Saharan Africa results in productivity-enhancing technology transfers to sub-Saharan African manufacturing firms. As trade flows between countries potentially results in interactions that lead to technological improvements in the production of goods and services, we parameterize the level of total factor productivity for African manufacturing firms as a function of foreign direct investment flow, and for the country in which it operates, trade openness with China, and its interaction with foreign direct investment. With micro-level data on manufacturing firms in five sub-Saharan African countries, we estimate the parameters of firm-level production functions between 1992 and 2004. Our parameter estimates reveal that across the firms and countries in our sample, there is no relationship between productivity-enhancing foreign direct investment and trade with China. In addition, increasing trade openness with China has no effect on the growth rate of total factor productivity. To the extent that total factor productivity and its growth is a crucial determinant of economic growth and living standards in the long run, our results suggest that increasing trade openness with China is not a long-run source of higher living standards for sub-Saharan Africa."
Sociology	"The article argues that metaphors play a key role in shaping theoretical language of sociology, building methodological tools and interpretation of the data. Unique metaphors characterize sociological paradigm Marxism, functionalism, interactionism. They help to make scientific discoveries and organize everyday communication language of sociologists. The situation is similar in all sciences, not excluding natural ones. Today there are new examples of the metaphor of sociology as a proof of its undiminished creative powers."
Ethnic Studies	"In this paper, I will analyse a case of ethnic transformation in post-1991 Ethiopia based on an ethnographic study of the Eastern Gurage. The case represents an ethnic setting where the conventional conceptualization of ethnicity in terms of a notion of origin undermines the diversities expressed in various forms of category and boundary formations. The ethnic setting does not also fall into, but combines, the commonplace dichotomization of primordialist versus constructivist notion of ethnicity. Not only by taking Barth""s (1969) formalist anthropological conception of ethnicity as boundary formation, but also suggesting my own analytical distinction, I will attempt to account for the various forms of ethnicities particularly those based on clanship, locality, Islam and state""s categorization. In this regard, I have introduced a distinction between the concepts of identity and belonging in order to explain the different forms of social and political classifications, ideologies and power relationships that are often treated as implying a single phenomenon, i.e. identity formation."
Substance Abuse	"Spice is an herbal mixture smoked for euphoria and mixed with synthetic cannabinoids that are undetected on urine drug screens. Spice use has increased in the military because it is considered legal and is not detected on urine drug screen. The authors describe 3 cases of Spice use in military members. Case 1: 19-year-old male presented with paranoia, agitation, and visual hallucinations after smoking the ""Space"" brand of Spice. Urine thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were negative. Case 2: 19-year-old female presented with sedation, amnesia, and agitation. She smoked the ""Space"" brand. She was alert within 3 hours of arrival. Urine GC-MS detected levorphanol. Case 3: 23-year-old male presented with delusions and paranoia. He complained of ""monsters on his back."" His symptoms improved in the emergency department (ED). His urine TLC and GC-MS were negative. All cases were admitted and evaluated by a toxicologist; all 3 had their history corroborated by family or friends, or with drug paraphernalia. Spice is a new herbal mixture that is increasingly used in the military. Expected effects are similar to cannabis, but may include more paranoia and hallucinations, and may differ for each brand."

Business	"Purpose - This study aims to compare academic prescriptive models on how to choose a branding strategy on the continuum from a ""branded house"" to a ""house of brands"" with real-life branding strategies of leading companies. Design/methodology/approach - Data from an executive survey, observations and desk research on 75 leading companies in Austria are analysed with multilevel weighted least squares (WLS) regression. Findings - Branding strategies for products are determined by industry (23 per cent of variance), the overall strategy of the company (28 per cent), the remaining variance being product-level decisions deviating from both. Service and consumer durables companies lean more towards corporate branding than consumer nondurables. On the company level, synergies in advertising, e-commerce and e-CRM (customer-relationship management) increase the usage of shared brands. A higher company age leads to brand proliferation. On the product level, quality differences between products, the emphasis on and differences in experiential product positioning and, marginally, the symbolic differences between products favour individual brands. Research limitations/implications - Future research should investigate additional markets, additional drivers, small and medium-sized entreprises (SMEs) and employ additional measures. Practical implications - The study informs brand-architecture audits with benchmarks from leading companies, calls for a view of brand architecture more flexible than ideal-type categories proposed in literature and cautions against management inertia, industry standards and trends in designing branding strategies. Originality/value - This study is the first quantitative cross-industry multi-level study on real-life branding strategies. It also applies a new conceptualisation and measurement of branding strategy."
Law	"The mission of the U. S. Department Veterans Affairs (""VA"") is ""[t]o care for shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan"" by providing services and benefits to America's veterans. As part of its mission, the VA administers a complex disability benefits program intended to compensate those veterans whose service-related prevent them from fully engaging in the workforce. But the current VA disability benefits model constrains both its capacity to provide required services and its ability to adapt to the changing needs of the constituency it serves. So too does the VA's outmoded disability assessment model, which amounts to a ""one-size-fits-all"" evaluation that determines the severity of a veteran's disability based solely on symptomatology, and not the veteran's actual ability to function in the workplace. This Article suggests that the VA should instead employ a more holistic, individualized approach to assisting veterans disabled by their service by accounting for both economic and quality of life factors when assessing disability, considering both finite and ongoing payment options when providing disability benefits, and emphasizing rehabilitation and recovery in addition to compensation when providing services to those who have served."
Demography	"BACKGROUND Most research on the imprisonment-mortality relationship has focused exclusively on non-Hispanic black males and non-Hispanic white males at the national level in the United States. OBJECTIVE To document variation in this relationship across states by race/ethnicity and sex. METHODS We estimate the crude and age-specific mortality rates of state prisoners and of the general population in 7-9 states. We also present the resulting standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). RESULTS The results provide support for four key conclusions. First, although there is substantial cross-state variability in the mortality rates of male and female state prisoners, there is far more cross-state variability in the mortality rates of males and females in the general population. Second, the mortality advantage of male prisoners over males in the general population was larger than the mortality advantage of female prisoners over females in the general population. Third, relative to same-race and same-sex peers in the general population, black males experienced the largest mortality advantage across all of the states considered, and this advantage was often quite substantial. Finally, Hispanic female state prisoners in New York were the one group at a significant mortality disadvantage relative to the general population, although because of the small number of Hispanic female state prisoners who died over this period ( 20), further research testing the robustness of this finding to different time periods and places is sorely needed. CONCLUSION Although mortality disparities among prisoners are smaller than those found in the general population, research should consider how conditions of confinement affect the mortality of prisoners."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"Gauss's quadratic reciprocity theorem is among the most important results in the history of number theory. It's also among the most mysterious: since its discovery in the late eighteenth century, mathematicians have regarded reciprocity as a deeply surprising fact in need of explanation. Intriguingly, though, there's little agreement on how the theorem is best explained. Two quite different kinds of proof are most often praised as explanatory: an elementary argument that gives the theorem an intuitive geometric interpretation, due to Gauss and Eisenstein, and a sophisticated proof using algebraic number theory, due to Hilbert. Philosophers have yet to look carefully at such explanatory disagreements in mathematics. I do so here. According to the view I defend, there are two important explanatory virtues-depth and transparency-which different proofs (and other potential explanations) possess to different degrees. Although not mutually exclusive in principle, the packages of features associated with the two stand in some tension with one another, so that very deep explanations are rarely transparent, and vice versa. After developing the theory of depth and transparency and applying it to the case of quadratic reciprocity, I draw some morals about the nature of mathematical explanation."
Urban Studies	"The following article examines the transformation of the ideas of the Austrian-American planner John Friedmann, on regional and urban planning, during his time as the director of the Urban and Regional Development Advisory Program of the Ford Foundation in Chile (urdapic, 1965-1969). Friedmann coins the notion of innovative planning as a new paradigm that supplants the rational, scientific basis of development planning by conceiving action as the engine for structural change in underdeveloped countries. These ideas are framed in the transformations that took place during Eduardo Frei Montalva's government (1964-1969), acknowledging that it is in the feedback between politics and technique that Friedmann's ideas acquired significance."
Ethics	"Conflict of interests is a situation when someone is in need of other people's trust on one the hand and has personal or general interests on the other hand, resulting in conflict with the given responsibility. In this research work, an attempt was made to find the relation between declarations of conflict of interests and reporting positive outcomes in the dental journals in Iran (2000-2016). In this analytical/cross-sectional study, first Health and Biomedical Information was searched and all the Persian and English dental journals published in Iran were collected. Then, all the papers published in the journals from December 2000 to December 2016 were collected and categorized in terms of the year of publication, author or authors' affiliations, Persian and English journal, type of the substance or the drug used (including the manufacturing company), declarations of conflict of interests and the positive or negative conclusion of the report. Data were analyzed with the Fisher's exact test and Chi squared test, using the program SPSS 18. In numerical analysis, the significance was set at P<0.05. Seventeen dental journals in Persian and English were analyzed: 10 in English and 7 in Persian. Reviewing these studies showed that of 1021 articles in Persian, in 128 cases there was no mention of a declaration of conflict of interests and in 11 cases, the COI had been stated. In addition, from 1220 articles in English, in 825 cases there was no mention of declarations of conflict of interests and in 45 cases, the declarations of COI had been mentioned. There was no significant relation between the COI and no' COI and the reporting of positive outcomes in papers in Iranian dental journals in terms of the journal type, year of publication and the journals' guarantee form (P=0.25, P=0.41 and P=0.09). A total of 83% of studies with declarations of COI had one positive outcome, with a significant relationship in this field; however, in 73% of studies with no COI, there was one positive outcome, too. In general, the society expects that doctors would not consider any incentives except the health of the patients in the efforts made by them. The severity of the consequences of COI is of higher value when the patients' health is endangered due to it. In addition, COI might change the attitude and approach of other doctors and peers."
Demography	"Using data from multi-waves of the National Family Health Survey conducted in India between 1992 and 2006, this study examines the pattern of rural-urban differentials in childhood malnutrition in India over time. Furthermore, it identifies the factors responsible for the rural-urban gap in childhood malnutrition and quantifies their contribution. The result shows a considerable and widening gap in childhood malnutrition across rural-urban residence in the country over the study period. The rural-urban gap in childhood malnutrition has narrowed in a few states whereas it widened in most states over time. The economic status of the household and parental education was the most significant contributors to the rural-urban gap in childhood malnutrition in India. Based on the findings, this study suggests that to reduce the rural-urban gap in childhood malnutrition, focus should be given to the rural poor."
Family Studies	"There is a well-documented relationship between health and employment, and among women in particular, research ties health of the workers themselves and their family members to employment outcomes. However, little research considers the health of multiple family members simultaneously. Building on research linking individual-level health to women's employment, this article examines health as a family-level construct. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I explore how the number of chronic condition diagnoses reported by women and their family members relates to women's employment, and consider potential variation by educational attainment. Results show that women's number of diagnoses more consistently predicts employment than the number of diagnoses at the family level, and these effects do not vary by women's education. This research emphasizes the importance of multidimensional health measures and the need for more research on the family context of women's employment."
Linguistics	"This article approaches the origin of multilingual innovations in language contact by presenting data from an intensive contact situation between two closely related Finnic languages, Finnish and Estonian. This situation between languages that have complex interconnected morphological systems often leads to the emergence of structures that contain material from both languages. The origin of these structures is discussed in the light of two basic assumptions: that in the mind of the bilingual speaker, the elements of the two languages are connected to each other via phonological and semantic or functional similarities and that both languages of the bilingual speaker always remain active and available during speech processing. The simultaneous activation of synonymous, competing elements or patterns is hypothesised to be the cause for the inevitable presence of both language-internal and cross-linguistic forces at the initial stage of language change."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"I use data from the General Social Survey to evaluate several hypotheses regarding how beliefs in and about God predict attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I find that certainty in the belief in God significantly predicts negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I also find that belief in a caring God and in a God that is the primary source of moral rules significantly predicts negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I also find that respondents"" beliefs about the how close they are to God and how close they want to be with God predict negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. These associations hold even after controlling for religious affiliation, religious attendance, views of the Bible, and sociodemographic factors. The findings indicate that to understand individuals"" attitudes about voluntary euthanasia, one must pay attention to their beliefs in and about God."
Sociology	"This article utilizes gay adult film as a means to understand the commodities generated through intimate labor. It offers a new concept, intimate commodities, in order to understand what, in addition to intimacy, is produced through intimate labor. Intimate commodities are material objects that are generated in conjunction with intimate labor, which are then traded or sold, and through their utilization generate intimate ties between individuals and themselves, other persons, or groups. Through ethnography and a survey of men who perform in the gay adult film industry, this study explores how the stratification of the conditions of production influence the commodities themselves, their use, and how, through their circulation, they may perpetuate inequalities. This conceptualization calls for increased attention to the illusory divide between productive and reproductive labor."
Social Work	"Women's childbirth experiences are not widely researched in the social work literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to answer questions related to the child-birthing experience. One hundred and nineteen participants responded to a 26-item online questionnaire between April and June 2008, and their written narratives were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Themes regarding the spiritual dimensions of childbirth emerged from the data and support current research demonstrating the importance of spirituality in women's lives and the meaningful and transformative nature of childbirth experiences. Implications for addressing spirituality in practice when working with childbearing women are explored. Future research that explores how spirituality may function as a protective factor for women with difficult pregnancies, births, and transitions to parenting is recommended."
Health Policy & Services	"Objective: The intensive and varied services required by high-need patients have inspired a number of new care delivery models; however, evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. This study evaluated whether augmenting a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) with intensive outpatient management enhances high-need patients' care processes. Research Design: Retrospective analysis using differences-indifferences and. 2 tests. Subjects: Of 545 high-need patients receiving PCMH care, 140 were previously randomly selected for the intensive outpatient management program; the remaining received usual care. Measures: We evaluated program effects on care continuity (proportion of primary care visits with assigned primary care physician); access (proportion of telephone visits out of all primary care encounters, missed appointment rate); care coordination (rate of follow-up after hospital discharge, new telehealth enrollment); and patient engagement (rates of online personal health record registration, advance directive completion). Results: Compared with patients receiving usual care, patients enrolled in intensive management experienced a 5.9% increase in proportion of primary care visits with an assigned primary care physician (P<0.001) and a 17.9% increase in proportion of telephone-based visits (P<0.001). Patients in the program had 7.5% higher rates of telehealth referral (P=0.01), 17.2% higher rates of advance directive completion (P<0.01), and 9.3% higher rates of personal health record registration (P=0.02). There was no effect on missed appointments or posthospital discharge visit rates. Conclusions: Augmenting a PCMH with intensive outpatient management may have positive effects on primary care processes related to continuity, access, coordination, and patient engagement."
Development Studies	"This article examines the overseas behaviour of Chinese non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in two African nations, Ethiopia and Malawi, with varying political regime types. Our findings suggest that, irrespective of regime type, Chinese NGOs have yet to make a substantial impact in either nation. We argue that, despite the strength of the Chinese state and high levels of international development assistance given, domestic politics and regulatory frameworks in host nations still matter a great deal. Our study suggests that the Chinese model of international development will continue to be one in which temporary one-off projects are favoured; and, insofar as social organisations will play a role, they will be in the domain of government-organised NGOs rather than grassroots NGOs."
Development Studies	"This study analyses the distributive consequences associated with the recent international food price crisis in the Andean region. The study explores the distributive repercussions of the crisis by means of a simple simulation exercise which isolates the direct and short-term effects of actual increases in food prices across the Andean region. The paper finds substantive and heterogeneous poverty impacts, ranging from two to six per cent points in the incidence of poverty. Results are found very sensitive to the net consumer (or producer) position of the household, and less so across other characteristics of the household. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES To investigate the relationship between total estradiol (E2) levels and 9-year mortality in older postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). DESIGN Population-based study of persons living in the Chianti geographic area (Tuscany, Italy). SETTING Community. PARTICIPANTS A representative sample of 509 women aged 65 and older with measures of total E2. MEASUREMENTS Serum total E2 was measured at the University of Parma using ultrasensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA). RESULTS Women who died (n=135) during 9 years of follow up were older; had higher total E2 levels; and were more likely to have evidence of stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure at baseline than survivors. Higher E2 levels were associated with a greater likelihood of death (hazard ratio (HR)=1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.06), and the relationship was independent of age, waist:hip ratio, C-reactive protein, education, cognitive function, physical activity, caloric intake, smoking, and chronic disease (HR=1.08 pg/mL, 95% CI=1.03-1.13, P=.003). The excessive risk of death associated with higher total E2 was not attenuated after adjustment for total testosterone (HR=1.12, 95% CI=1.02-1.18, P <.001) and after further adjustment for insulin resistance evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment (HR=1.07, 95% CI=1.03-1.17, P <.001). Total E2 was highly predictive of death after more than 5 years (HR=1.42: CI 1.01-1.91, P=.04) and not predictive of death for less than 5 years (P=.78). CONCLUSION Higher total E2 concentration predicts mortality in older women not taking HRT."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Cost-effectiveness of once-daily umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) was compared with once-daily tiotropium (TIO) and once-daily glycopyrronium (GLY) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Methods: A linked-equation model was implemented to estimate COPD progression, associated healthcare costs, exacerbations rates, life years (LY) and quality-adjusted LY (QALYs). Statistical risk equations for endpoints and resource use were derived from the ECLIPSE and TORCH studies, respectively. Treatment effects [mean (standard error)] at 12 weeks on forced expiratory volume in 1 s and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score were obtained from the intention-to-treat populations of two head-to-head studies [GSK study identifiers 201316 (NCT02207829) and 201315 (NCT02236611)] which compared UMEC 62.5 mcg with TIO 18 mcg and UMEC 62.5 mcg with GLY 50 mcg, respectively. Treatment costs reflect UK list prices (2016) and NHS unit costs; UMEC and GLY prices being equal and less than TIO. A lifetime horizon, discounted costs and effects at 3.5% were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of variations in input parameters and assumptions in the model. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, UMEC was predicted to increase LYs (+ 0.195; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.069, 0.356) and QALYs (+ 0.118; 95% CI: 0.055, 0.191) and reduce the number of annual exacerbations (-0.053; 95% CI: -0.171, 0.028) compared with TIO, with incremental cost savings of 460 pound/patient (95% CI: -645 pound, -240) pound. Compared with GLY, UMEC increased LYs (+ 0.124; 95% CI: 0.015, 0.281) and QALYs (+ 0.101; 95% CI: 0.043, 0.179) and reduced annual exacerbation (-0.033; 95% CI: -0.135, 0.017) at an additional cost of 132 pound/patient (95% CI: 12 pound, 330) pound, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1310 pound/QALY (95% CI: 284 pound, 2060) pound. Similar results were observed in alternative time horizons and additional sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: For treatment of patients with COPD in the UK over a lifetime horizon, treatment with UMEC dominates treatment with TIO, providing both improved health outcomes and cost savings.

History	"This article takes as its starting point an encounter with a preserved blue bird-of-paradise skin. Though rare, the bird became wildly famous after it perched atop the head of Carrie Bradshaw during Sex and the City: The Movie. However, where in the movie the bird-skin acted as Carrie's something blue, I mobilize it in this article as a telling example of near-extinction. This is because the blue bird-of-paradise is but one of the millions of Paradisaea that were hunted, traded, shipped, and lusted after since their earliest forms of commodification. And as the theory of sexual selection confirms, biographical entitlement cannot be assigned to a singular agent in the blue bird-of-paradise's story, which is why this article will chart its biogeographies: from New Guinea rainforests to New York streets. Here, instead of tracing the blue bird-of-paradise's individual commodity biography, it becomes an act of tracing and placing the bird-skin within the life and death worlds of human-animal relations that produced, mobilized, and maintain(ed) it as a commodity over time and space. In doing so, the article makes two important contributions to the field of social history. First, by conceptually focusing on the relations that produce lives, things, and worlds, it challenges the certainty that anchors the narration of biographies to the singular and anthropocentric embodiment of a life. Second, mapping the biogeographies of a lively commodity, such as a preserved bird-of-paradise, offers the opportunity of highlighting the significant role so-called natural species and histories can play in shaping human histories."
Economics	"We study the relation between cognitive abilities and stockholding using the recent Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which has detailed data on wealth and portfolio composition of individuals aged 50+ in 11 European countries and three indicators of cognitive abilities: mathematical, verbal fluency, and recall skills. We find that the propensity to invest in stocks is strongly associated with cognitive abilities, for both direct stock market participation and indirect participation through mutual funds and retirement accounts. Since the decision to invest in less information-intensive assets (such as bonds) is less strongly related to cognitive abilities, we conclude that the association between cognitive abilities and stockholding is driven by information constraints, rather than by features of preferences or psychological traits.

Linguistics	"This paper addresses the topic of quality assessment in interpreting, from a perspective that defines quality as equivalent effect of source text and target text. The experimental study described uses an innovative methodology based on comprehension testing, to evaluate the widely accepted norm that an interpretation should produce the same effect - in the sense of effect on the listener's knowledge of a specific subject - as the original. More specifically, the study compares communicative effect between a marketing-related speech of about 15 minutes in non-native English and its simultaneous interpretation into German. The comparison is thus between two directly competing modes of communication, the use of English as a lingua franca being seen by many interpreters as a threat to their profession. Three experimental runs were completed, involving an Italian speaker comfortable with English as a medium for lecturing and a total of 139 listeners attending professionally oriented Austrian university courses. Results showed that in this setting the interpretation led to a better cognitive end-result in the audience than the original speech in non-native English."
"Education, Special"	"Background: Person-centred planning, which commonly becomes formalised within services for people with learning disabilities through an Essential Lifestyle Plan (ELP), was intended to help place the choices of individuals at the forefront of service provision. However, beyond UK government policy rhetoric, scholars have raised issues regarding the capacity of person-centred planning to empower people with learning disabilities to make choices about various aspects of their lives. This article assesses these debates, paying attention to the relationship between ELPs and choices made in relation to leisure activities. Materials and Methods: To examine leisure activities and choice-making in depth, the article draws upon ethnographic research conducted with four adults living in a supported living scheme. It focuses upon their domestic musical activities, connecting data derived from participant observation with the contents of ELPs. Results: This study found that person-centred planning underplayed processes involved with articulations of musical choice and also the peculiarities of the settings in which choices were made. It also found that leisure preferences expressed in ELPs did not effectively convey the richness and sociocultural significance of everyday domestic musical activities within the supported living scheme. Conclusions: Person-centred planning should not be divorced from social context, relationships and differing degrees of dependency. Domestic leisure activities such as listening to music, while not necessarily 'meaningful' in the terms laid out in UK policy discourse, can become crucial resources for social bonding for people with learning disabilities. Thus, they should be considered carefully as part of a dynamic, socially situated and person-centred planning process."
History Of Social Sciences	"The relationship between American psychology and gender ideologies in the two decades following World War II was complicated and multivalent. Although many psy-professionals publicly contributed to the cult of domesticity that valorized women's roles as wives and mothers, other psychologists, many of them women, reimagined traditional sex roles to accommodate and deproblematize the increasing numbers of women at work, especially working mothers. In this article, I excavate and highlight the contributions of several of these psychologists, embedding their efforts in the context of the paradoxical expectations for women that colored the postwar and increasingly Cold War landscape of the United States. By arguing that conflict was inherent in the lives of both women and men, that role conflict (when it did occur) was a cultural, not intrapsychic, phenomenon, and that maternal employment itself was not damaging to children or families, these psychologists connected the work of their first-wave, first-generation forebears with that of the explicitly feminist psychologists who would come after them."
Social Issues	"In recent years the science-and-religion/spirituality/theology dialogue has flourished, but the impact on the minds of the general public, on society as a whole, has been less impressive. Also, religious believers and outspoken atheists face each other without progressing toward a common understanding. The view taken here is that achieving a more marked impact of the dialogue would be beneficial for a peaceful survival of humanity. I aim to argue the why and how of that task by analyzing three possible purposes of the dialogue and their logical interdependence, suggest conceivable improvements of the quality and extent of the current efforts toward a negotiated action plan, and consider an enlargement of the circle of the actors involved. The dialogue that has been carried on between science and religion/spirituality/theology could be expanded and usefully applied to some major problems in the present world."
Transportation	"The increasing popularity of agent-based models leads to new requirements regarding the data used for modelling and calibration. On the one hand, more detailed and insightful models are necessary to represent behaviour at an individual level. On the other hand, calibration data needs to be more finely-grained. For both exercises, data has to be available at a very high level of spatial and temporal detail. Modern survey technologies offer the potential to obtain this data. However, they also bring along new challenges that have to be overcome to make them usable for real world applications. This paper discusses some of these challenges along with a presentation of the modern survey technologies that are currently researched and used most actively. The aim is to provide guidelines that help researcher and practitioners to find the appropriate data source depending on the purpose and design of their study and the subsequent modelling."
Social Issues	"The article focuses on stories and storytelling practices as explanatory resources in standardization processes. It draws upon an ethnographic study of the development of a technical standard for data sharing in an ecological research community, where participants struggle to articulate the difficulties encountered in implementing the standard. Building from C. Wright Mills' classic distinction between private troubles and public issues, the authors follow the development of a story as it comes to assist in transforming individual troubles in standard implementation into an institutional issue for the ecological scientific community. The authors present the ""hands-on"" social science collaboration in this study as an example of a mechanism for supporting institutionalization of issues. Finally, the authors argue that narratives can serve as effective organizing principles within institutional settings, thereby providing an approach to understand the practical, substantive difficulties that occur in work with data in the sciences."
Communication	"As mobile social network services have been integrated in many people's daily lives, this study investigated the relationships between gratifications-sought, social network service use on mobile devices, civic attitudes and civic engagement in Mainland China. Data were gathered in a survey of 760 university students. Results showed that gratifications for technological convenience (accessibility), information exchange (cognition needs), and social interaction (recognition needs) significantly predicted civic engagement. The results also demonstrated that civic attitudes and social network service use on mobile devices are positively related to civic engagement. These findings well demonstrated the important role of mobile-based communication in connecting citizens to civil society."
Transportation	"This work solves an integrated model of the continuous berth allocation and specific quay crane (QC) assignment problem with QC coverage range. Based on the analysis of vessel berth position and QC coverage range, a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is developed. A novel heuristic method based on spatiotemporal conflict analysis is applied to derive a high-quality berth-QCs plan. The initial pessimistic priorities of vessels are employed to reflect the preferences of vessels for terminal resources. The proposed cluster of vessels focuses on spatiotemporal conflicts among vessels. Coordinated assignments of resources for the clustered vessels are realized via the branch-and-bound method. The QC feasibility check identifies infeasibility of QCs-to-vessel assignment. Several experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results demonstrate that high-quality berth-QCs plans can be obtained within an acceptable time. Further, the influence of coverage range of QC is discussed in detail."
Economics	"This short article advocates the further development of Indonesia through an export-oriented industrialization policy. It opines that it is only through this policy that the perennial depreciation of the Indonesian exchange rate, including through capital flight, can be stopped. The article also advocates a twin-engine approach, with the State be responsible for the efficient supply of public goods, and the private sector, including the active participation of foreign investment, be encouraged, actively, for the supply of private goods, with concentration on export-oriented manufactured goods. The social and educational system will have to give support to this fundamental policy shift."
Health Policy & Services	"The objectives of this study were to document the background prevalence and incidence of HCV infection among HCWs in Ain Shams University Hospitals in Cairo and analyse the risk factors for HCV infection. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2008 among 1770 HCWs. Anti-HCV prevalence was age-standardized using the Cairo population. A prospective cohort was followed for a period of 18 months to estimate HCV incidence. The crude anti-HCV prevalence was 8.0% and the age-standardized seroprevalence was 8.1%. Risk factors independently associated with HCV seropositivity were: age, manual worker, history of blood transfusions and history of parenteral anti-schistosomiasis treatment. The estimated incidence of HCV infection was 7.3 per 1000 person-years. HCWs in this setting had a similar high HCV seroprevalence as the general population of greater Cairo."
History Of Social Sciences	"To date, historians of psychology have largely ignored the role of academic publishing and the editorial policies of the late nineteenth century. This paper analyzes the role played by academic publishing in the history of psychology in the specific case of France, a country that provides a very interesting and unique model. Up until the middle of the 1890s, there was no collection specifically dedicated to psychology. Alfred Binet was the first to found, in 1897, a collection of works specifically dedicated to scientific psychology. He chose to work with Reinwald-Schleicher. However, Binet was soon confronted with (1) competition from other French publishing houses, and (2) Schleicher's management and editorial problems that were to sound the death knell for Binet's emerging editorial ambitions. The intention of this paper is to encourage the efforts of the pioneers of modern psychology to have their work published and disseminated."
Business	"The outsourcing of innovation activities, geographic clustering of firms, and mobility of labor each allow knowledge to circulate within industries. This study investigates knowledge spillover mechanisms' effects on industry innovativeness and profit, and how these effects change with the level of industry growth. Generally, the set of hypotheses presented suggests enhanced performance effects from knowledge spillover mechanisms under growth; the pace of developments in growth industries increases the importance of access to knowledge. Analysis of an industry-level data set assembled from five secondary sources consists of both regression and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). While regression detects the discrete effects of each mechanism, fsQCA identifies specific configurations of these mechanisms associated with the outcome, emphasizing causal complexity. In general, outsourcing negatively affects innovativeness (though one identified configuration represents a unique case within which outsourcing can aid innovativeness), but benefits profitability. All three elements of the knowledge spillover regime examined here have performance implications contingent on growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Using waterpipe is the most common method of tobacco consumption among Iranian females and the rate has significantly increased over the past few decades. Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that contribute to the initiation of waterpipe tobacco smoking among females in Gorgan, Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2016 in Gorgan. Two hundred and six females who smoked waterpipe tobacco were recruited as participants using convenience and snowball sampling methods. Data were collected using a questionnaire examining the factors that facilitate initiation of waterpipe smoking among females. Results: Positive attitudes towards waterpipe smoking and its availability were the most frequently reported factors contributing to its initiation among females (87.9%). Curiosity (80.1%) and waterpipe smoking among family members (70.9%) were also significant. The least frequently reported factor was ""attracting other's attention and cooperation"". Conclusion: A positive opinion, availability, curiosity and presence of waterpipe smoking among family members and relatives were the most signifcant factors that facilitated initiation of waterpipe smoking among females. To reduce its prevalence, it is recommended that intervention strategies be implemented to change attitudes and reduce access to waterpipe tobacco at family and social gatherings."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This article provides a discussion on the question of validity in qualitative evaluation. Although validity in qualitative inquiry has been widely reflected upon in the methodological literature (and is still often subject of debate), the link with evaluation research is underexplored. Elaborating on epistemological and theoretical conceptualizations by Guba and Lincoln and Creswell and Miller, the article explores aspects of validity of qualitative research with the explicit objective of connecting them with aspects of evaluation in social policy. It argues that different purposes of qualitative evaluations can be linked with different scientific paradigms and perspectives, thus transcending unproductive paradigmatic divisions as well as providing a flexible yet rigorous validity framework for researchers and reviewers of qualitative evaluations."
Ethnic Studies	"The emergence of Islamic piety movements in post-Soviet Tatarstan has set afoot two parallel processes: (1) religion has progressively left the narrow sphere to which it was relegated during the Soviet era - old age, the private domain and ethnically connoted rural contexts - through a series of steps including the early appearance of makeshift shops catering to a Muslim clientele, the boom of self-cultivation techniques among the region's youthful Muslim middle class, the subsequent development of a full-blown halal industry and the appearance of a whole range of new places for pietists. The deprivatisation of Islam has thus changed the urban fabric of Tatarstan, making Islamic piety visible in cities and towns. Concomitantly, (2) the 'inner world' - the soul (nafs), self or subjectivity - of Muslims has taken centre stage as one of the most (if not the most) central sites of religious life, the main interface for encountering the divine and a 'space' that needs constant maintenance through discipline and ascetical practice (askesis) framed in terms of care of one's soul. Thus, the appearance of new 'outside' spaces (halal places) appears to correspond to the configuration of new 'inside' spaces (the subjectivity of religionists). This paper aims to explore this correspondence and to investigate its anthropological implications."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This study provides a structural model of arbitral decision making that depicts arbitrators as deciding cases by ascertaining the facts, attaching weights to the facts, and combining the facts and weights to form decision elements that determine their decisions. The model further posits that arbitrators' biographical characteristics affect their decisions by influencing their fact finding and weight assignments. It also allows for arbitrators' characteristics to have a direct impact on their decisions. A test of the model indicates that the decision elements determine the arbitrators' decisions but the arbitrators' characteristics have a limited impact."
International Relations	"Given the limitations of a short commentary, this article is restricted to an attempt to summarize the argument of a relatively small book, Discourses of Power. This book is adorned by a beautiful picture of Citizen Kane, no doubt chosen by its author, and characterized by an argument of dazzling coherence, which not only sums up and dispenses with most of the fundamental ideas about power in the canon of Western political theory but also provides a balanced appraisal of its radical alternative. Here, I attempt to resist the thesis that it is impossible to disagree with anything in this book. I ask whether, in addition to the view of power as capacity and power as right addressed in the book, Hindess should have considered the influential view of power as appropriation."
Political Science	"This article historically considers major public inquiries as an institution of the British regulatory state, using recent data from parliamentary committees. Major inquiries draw upon judicial independence to restore political authority. Despite their formally 'public' character, major inquiries were more confined to matters internal to the state before the 1980s, reflecting the insularity of 'club rule' and the invisibility of the actual 'public'. Inquiries began to assume their modern form in the 1960s, but it was in the context of the need for new institutions that arose with the collapse of 'club rule' that inquiries took on new significance. Their increased use reflects not simply an increase in the number of events necessitating such a response, but a greater need for a mechanism with both a public orientation and formal independence. The article suggests that inquiries may have become overburdened instruments, particularly in relation to an expectation to effectively eliminate risk.

Linguistics	"Based on data from a research project on African identities in Melbourne, this paper assesses the attitudes of non-refugee African-Australians towards their ethnic languages in the context of the utility and prestige of English in Australia. The paper explores the tensions between discourses on rights to language(s) of choice and discourses on conforming to prescribed languages. It opens new questions about ethnic language loyalty and language maintenance among African-Australians. The following questions are addressed: how do African communities in Australia perceive their ethnic languages? What is the state of ethnic language maintenance among African-Australians? How do dominant monolingual discourses influence the attitude of African migrants towards their ethnic languages? How are African-Australian identities shaped and mediated by competing attitudes towards English on the one hand and migrant ethnic languages on the other?."
Area Studies	"Cooperatives are a promising link that can coalesce subdisciplines such as agrarian, labor, economic, and social history. This article reassesses the significance of cooperatives in the agrarian and social history of South Asia. It provides a broad sketch of the major historical developments-legal, economic, and social-in India up to 1970, emphasizing the continuity between the colonial and postcolonial periods in terms of state engagement with cooperatives. The article goes on to discuss the existing historiography regarding the cooperative movement on the subcontinent, arguing for the substitution of the prevailing notion of failure with a more historically grounded and nuanced approach that takes into consideration the broader economic context, as well as social stratification and inequality. Finally, some promising avenues-including, but not limited to, organizational economics, bottom-up social and cultural history, and global history-are suggested for the future historiography of cooperatives in South Asia."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Injury is a major cause of death in adults. Although racial disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes are well documented for medical conditions, the influence of race on access to emergent care after injury has received little scrutiny. Objectives: We sought to determine whether race was associated with risk of in-hospital death after injury. Research Design: Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (1998-2002) were used to estimate multivariate models of in-hospital mortality, controlling for age, race, gender, comorbid conditions, injury severity, primary payer, median income of zip code of residence, and hospital type. Additional multivariate models were estimated among stratified subsets of patients, including injury severity and hospital type. Subjects: Patients age 18-64 with a primary diagnosis of injury. Results: Relative to injured white patients, black and Asian patients had a higher risk of death [1.5% vs. 2.1% and 2.0%, multivariate odds ratios (OR) = 1.14 and 1.39]. Other racial/ethnic groups showed no significant mortality difference from white patients. In stratified analyses, we found large black-white mortality disparities among mild to moderately injured patients (OR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.66), whereas Asian-white disparities were concentrated among more severely injured patients (OR 1.37, 95% confidence inter-vat: 1.03-1.80). Conclusions: Black and Asian patients have a higher risk of death after injury than white patients. These data raise important questions about access to quality trauma care for racial minority patients."
Anthropology	"Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"HIV-related stigma has been shown to have profound effects on people living with HIV (PLWH). When stigma is experienced in a healthcare setting, negative health outcomes are exacerbated. We sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a healthcare setting stigma-reduction intervention, the Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV (FRESH) Workshop, in the United States. This intervention, adapted from a similar strategy implemented in Africa, brought together healthcare workers (HW) and PLWH to address HIV-related stigma. Two pilot workshops were conducted in Alabama and included 17 HW and 19 PLWH. Participants completed questionnaire measures pre- and post-workshop, including open-ended feedback items. Analytical methods included assessment of measures reliability, pre-post-test comparisons using paired t-tests, and qualitative content analysis. Overall satisfaction with the workshop experience was high, with 87% PLWH and 89% HW rating the workshop ""excellent'' and the majority agreeing that others like themselves would be interested in participating. Content analysis of open-ended items revealed that participants considered the workshop informative, interactive, wellorganized, understandable, fun, and inclusive, while addressing real and prevalent issues. Most pre- and post-test measures had good-excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.70 to 0.96) and, although sample sizes were small, positive trends were observed, reaching statistical significance for increased awareness of stigma in the health facility among HW (p = 0.047) and decreased uncertainty about HIV treatment among PLWH(p = 0.017). The FRESH intervention appears to be feasible and highly acceptable to HW and PLWH participants and shows great promise as a healthcare setting stigma-reduction intervention for US contexts."
Linguistics	"The present study investigates how listeners of Finnish and Japanese, languages with very similar contrasts in plosive quantity (short vs. long), use language-specific phonetic knowledge of acoustic attributes which covary with closure duration. A fully-crossed perceptual experiment on consonant quantity categorization was conducted with 22 Finnish and 20 Japanese listeners, using natural speech stimuli with systematically manipulated closure durations. Stimuli were created from Finnish and Japanese productions of both long and short plosives. In the naturally produced stimuli, the duration of the vowel preceding the target consonant was affected by language-specific word prosody patterns. The results showed an across-the-board effect of the original quantity of the produced stimulus, with the stimuli created from words with a geminate consonant tending to be perceived as geminate, irrespective of the language of the listeners or talkers, suggesting a strong influence of cues besides closure duration that are shared by the two languages. However, Japanese listeners were more heavily affected by the acoustic cues concomitant to the quantity contrast in their native language, likely due to robust language-specific vowel duration effects in the Japanese productions. Word prosody, besides creating subtle shifts in category boundary for both language groups, created confusions in the listener responses, especially when the language-specific word-level prosodic effect is localized in the vowel preceding the target word, and when the listener is confronted with stimuli from the other language. Thus, some aspects of the quantity contrast are remarkably similar between the two languages, and listeners from one language group are attuned to attributes found in the other language. However, other attributes appear to be language specific, and such durational differences may interfere with categorization in an unfamiliar language. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Using administrative data for the period 2005-2010, we test for the existence of segmentation in the pool of the unemployed receiving benefits and investigate the factors associated with the duration and recurrence of the receipt of unemployment benefits in Spain. The results suggest the existence of (at least) three groups of individuals, each with different combinations of covered unemployment duration and recurrence. We also find that the impact of the employment crisis has been an increase in the average length of time spent receiving unemployment benefits and the recurrence. Our findings support the hypothesis that not only the heterogeneity but also the previous experience of receipt increase the expected duration of subsequent benefit periods."
History Of Social Sciences	"In 1967, jurisdiction over clean air policy in Toronto and the rest of Ontario's municipalities was transferred to the provincial government. Even though the municipalities had obtained extensive authority to regulate air pollution within their own boundaries nine years earlier, the vast majority (apart from Toronto) had not developed clean air programmes. Yet air pollution was a highly salient issue that aroused considerable public attention and local activism. This paper provides an account of the provincial takeover in air pollution, focusing on two factors enabling the Ontario government to pass two statutes transferring authority from municipalities to the provincial Department of Health. First, despite resistance in Toronto, the policy change was favoured by industry, which had more influence in the provincial government than across municipalities. Second, the inherently symbolic features of clean air policy allowed the provincial government to satisfy public demand for action while not appreciably creating more stringent regulations. These findings are consistent with studies of US clean air policy displaying a similar tendency among industry to support regulatory standardization across broad political scales."
Urban Studies	"Investments in public infrastructure and land upzoning aimed to high-rise redevelopment are both factors that considerably increase ground rent values in the city. Drawing on a dataset of new departments sold between 2008 and 2011, with data on unit size and commercial sale price, and discounting costs of land and construction, a multiple linear regression analysis is conducted with controlled fixed factors. The analysis shows that in Greater Santiago, state investment in Metro subway networks increases the ground rent captured by redevelopers by 25.6%, whereas only 5.5% by private landowners. Likewise, each additional point of the Coefficient of Constructability (Floor Area Ratio), which are contained in the municipal-level construction codes, increases by 6.1% the value of ground rent, revenues that are also absorbed by the private redeveloper. Given these results, it is important to discuss the efficiency of having a land rent tax in the country."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"Comparativismthe view that mass ratios are not grounded in absolute massesfaces a challenge by Baker which suggests that absolute masses are empirically meaningful. Regularity comparativism uses a liberalized version of the Mill-Ramsey-Lewis Best Systems Account to have both the laws of Newtonian gravity and the absolute mass scale supervene on a comparativist Humean mosaic as a package deal. I discuss three objections to this view and conclude that it is untenable. The most severe problem is that once we have reduced away the absolute masses, there is nothing that stops us from also reducing the mass ratios."
Economics	"The departure of a factor in excess supply in a non-traded rural sector leads to a Rural-led Exchange Rate Real Appreciation (RERA), in a dual economy setup. The RERA highlights for the first time a potential link between intra-national factor movements and real exchange rates. In China, where there is excess labor employed in the production of (largely) non traded rural goods, we attribute around one third of the recent appreciation of the real exchange rate - defined as the relative price of nontradables - to a RERA effect.

Demography	"Using data from the 1981, 1991, and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and several decennial censuses, we examine how characteristics of metropolitan areas are associated with black and white households' neighborhood racial composition. Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20% to 40% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations."
Urban Studies	Rationales used to legitimize forced dispersal and mixed-income housing policies are socially constructed based on assumptions about concentrated poverty. This study evaluates qualitative data on public housing residents who were in the process of being dispersed as part of a HOPE VI program in order to examine their thoughts about their original home and neighborhood. Residents' thoughts about their neighborhood are compared to policy rationales. Results indicate that current policy rationales are mostly in line with the goals and motivation of the city but are largely incongruent with the perceptions residents have of their pre-relocation home and neighborhood. The article concludes with policy recommendations for increasing and incorporating residents' views into policy design.
Urban Studies	"This paper is situated amidst concerns that public spaces are diminishing in both quantity and quality (Low & Smith, 2006), with this trend exacerbated by the excising of state budgets for their provision, maintenance or development, their privatisation and/or devolution of their management to corporate interests. Here we interrogate what 'public space' is using the lens of temporary use projects undertaken on privately-owned land. As a distinct form of DIY urbanism, it could be argued that temporary use projects might be least likely to promote enduring change but, in this paper, we demonstrate that it is their very transience that enables the interstices between the actual and the possible to be exploited in innovative ways. We explore how a distinctive methodology associated with temporary use projects, and a reconceptualisation of what public space is, creates new opportunities to restore the emancipatory potential of (increasingly) emaciated public places."
Political Science	"The growing importance that the study of emotions has acquired, with contributions from biology, neurology and even genetics, seems to have solved for some the traditional conflict with reason in favor of the emotions. The theory of the neurobiologist Antonio Damasio's somatic marker has become one of the most relevant in this revitalization of the role of emotions. The theory establishes the existence of an internal system of preferences in the human being that offers a guide about which actions are best suited to been applied to political decision making. However, if it is possible to affirm that politics must consist of something other than rational mastery over passions, an aporia will arise since politics itself will be denied. The present paper shows that the emphasis on the emotional side of the human being is a new version of the old idea that sees politics as a reflection of evil and that considers the political activity as necessary insofar as evil exists. The stress on emotions, therefore, seems doomed to eliminate the politics."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This article deals with the marketing strategies employed to promote the name of a place in a global context of heritage propertisation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two sites on the Costa da Morte' in Galicia, northwest of Spain, this article analyses the discourses and practices employed to commoditise place names and the strategies regarding place branding. In particular, two strategies are contemplated: first, the creation of a name to refer to a whole area, which is the case of the Costa da Morte', and, second, the name branding processes of two of the better-known villages on this coastline. Camarinas is developing a registered trademark for bobbin lace protection and the village of Finisterre is promoting the End of the World' as a tourist destination. This article focuses on the mechanisms by which place branding discourses and practices permeate various social agents and the naturalisation process of place branding structuring logics."
Communication	"In the current participatory television environment, social media serves both a social backchannel for interactions between audience members and a direct line of communication between audiences and production. Because audience activity on social media becomes part of the media brand, it is a priority for the industry to achieve some level of control/influence on that activity. In this article, I discuss writers' room Twitter accounts as a space used to model and reinforce fan behavior that serves industry interests, arguing that these accounts serve industry needs through the behaviors they promote and recognize. Through analysis of three writers' room Twitter accountsfor Jane the Virgin, Faking It, and Orange Is the New BlackI show how this process works, as well as the ways in which a show's individual industrial context shapes the type of fan that is hailed."
Urban Studies	"The issue of workers' housing affected most big cities in the world, chiefly at the end of the XIX century. Chile was one of the pioneer countries in enacting a law system built to confront the core of the problem. The 1906 Workers' Housing Law dealt with a new situation - the growing needs of blue-collar workers regarding housing - trying to implement solutions to an ever more pressing problem, although it did not affect all of society in a similar way. In the case of Valparaiso, its particular geographical location, limited possibilities of spatial development and a context of material and social needs prevented this Law to achieve its expected results. This paper analyses the Law's impact on some of Valparaiso's territorial and urban aspects, leading to the configuration of a hybrid and exclusive urban model which has so far survived."
Health Policy & Services	"Interprofessional education (IPE) needs to begin with foundational learning experiences for health professions learners at an institution. There is a recognized need for IPE to be embedded into health profession curriculums; however, several barriers prevent the implementation. The purpose of this project was to determine if an introductory online IPE course can overcome some of the existing barriers to implementing IPE while influencing team perceptions among health professional students. The modified Team Skills Scale was used to assess perceptions of students from six health professions programs pre-posttest to the introductory course. The researchers grounded the development of the course in the Institute of Medicine's Interprofessional Learning Continuum. Results show that an introductory online course in IPE can affect team perceptions of students and can be offered on a large scale with minimal impact on faculty workload. The pedagogical approach implies institutions with large numbers of health professions programs, large numbers of students and distance learners may benefit from a similar approach to introducing interprofessional collaboration."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"The amount of public interest in and media panic over youth, sexuality, and social media has grown in recent years. In this paper, we explore the discursive practices that are disciplining the digital intimacies of young people through print media discourses. Therefore, we use a Foucauldian feminist approach and conduct a discourse theoretical analysis of 183 news articles published in Northern Belgium between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2016. Our findings show that the discourse in newspapers reporting on youth, sexuality, and social media consists of three recurring discursive practices. First, there is the problematization of social media. Second, this problematization is legitimized by the use of authoritative voices, such as those of academics or other experts. Third, this results in a gendered categorization where young girls are extensively included in the debate and young boys and their digital experiences are most often excluded. This gendered discourse not only perpetuates sexual double standards throughout society but also implicitly disciplines young people to adhere to hetero-patriarchal ideals of femininity and masculinity."
Environmental Studies	"The social-ecological systems (SES) framework was developed to support communication across the multiple disciplines concerned with sustainable provision and/or appropriation of common-pool resources (CPRs). Transformation activities (e.g. processing, distribution, retailing) in which value is added to resource units appropriated from CPRs were assumed in developing the framework to be exogenous to the SES of focal concern. However, provision and appropriation of CPRs are nowadays often closely integrated with the market economy, so significant interdependence exists between many CPR provision/appropriation activities and the activities in which appropriated resource units are transformed into the products ultimately marketed or consumed. This paper presents a modified version of the SES framework designed to better account for transformation activities in order to be more suitable for diagnosing those sustainability problems where it is inappropriate to define all such activities as exogenous to the SES of focal concern. The need for such modification was identified in a research project examining the challenges faced by Cambodian cattle-owning smallholders in accessing value chains for premium-priced beef. Hence the immediate focus was on strengthening the SES framework's value for facilitating a multi-disciplinary diagnostic approach to food system research projects of this kind. The modified SES framework's potential in this respect was illustrated by a preliminary application that drew on literature reviewed for the Cambodian project. Significant further potential exists in using the modified framework as a foundation from which to develop a version that is suitable for application to SESs in which transformation systems are appropriately represented as endogenous. Maintaining consistency with the standard SES framework will enable communication to occur more effectively between food system researchers and CPR scholars more generally."
Business	"While service-dominant logic prescribes consumer participation with firms, some theorists of elitist democracy oppose citizen participation in governance because these theorists perceive citizens as being incompetent in political matters. This study, grounded in political marketing theory, suggests that citizens do, indeed, have the competence for participating in governance through the thin-participation methods (i.e., those not requiring citizen interaction in groups) presented herein. These methods feature relatively short amounts of time needed for individual respondents to learn about issues in an online environment and to take a survey including trade-off tasks as part of a discrete-choice experimental design. Set in the context of a budget crisis for a state (Wyoming), this study assessed citizens"" thoughts about the state""s political processes as well as about policy preferences for seven important policy areas of state budgeting. The results of this study provide evidence that citizens have the crucial operant resources (knowledge and skills) to participate in all types of political markets (electoral, governmental, and intragovernmental). The study offers researchers knowledge for further developing service-dominant logic in government ecosystems of service."
Nursing	"A few studies have examined the specific informational needs of the population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The aims of this study were to describe the information-seeking behavior and information needs of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their families in Korea by analyzing messages from an online patient community. A total of 1047 messages from the question and answer forum of the ""Lou Gehrig's Disease Network"" (http://cafe.daum.net/alsfree) from January 2010 to September 2015 were collected. The word frequency, main questions, and asker of the messages were analyzed and coded. Terms such as ""hospital,"" ""mother,"" ""father,"" ""gastrostomy,"" and ""ALS"" were most frequently identified. The most commonly mentioned main topic was about disease-specific information, while the most frequent subcategory was symptoms or management of symptoms. Other prominent categories concerned information about treatment, rehabilitation, and the medical system. The people who wrote the questions were mostly the son/daughter of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their family members commonly obtained information by posting their inquiries online and have a variety of questions regarding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in this study. The findings of this study can be used as a base of information for developing educational programs and resources for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their families."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Introduction Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in the United States. The treatment and control of hypertension is inadequate, especially among patients without health insurance coverage. The Affordable Care Act offered an opportunity to improve hypertension management by increasing the number of people covered by insurance. This study predicts the long-term effects of improved hypertension treatment rates due to insurance expansions on the prevalence and mortality rates of CVD of nonelderly Americans with hypertension. Methods We developed a state-transition model to simulate the lifetime health events of the population aged 25 to 64 years. We modeled the effects of insurance coverage expansions on the basis of published findings on the relationship between insurance coverage, use of antihypertensive medications, and CVD-related events and deaths. Results The model projected that currently anticipated health insurance expansions would lead to a 5.1% increase in treatment rate among hypertensive patients. Such an increase in treatment rate is estimated to lead to 111,000 fewer new coronary heart disease events, 63,000 fewer stroke events, and 95,000 fewer CVD-related deaths by 2050. The estimated benefits were slightly greater for men than for women and were greater among nonwhite populations. Conclusion Federal and state efforts to expand insurance coverage among nonelderly adults could yield significant health benefits in terms of CVD prevalence and mortality rates and narrow the racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes for patients with hypertension."
Linguistics	"In mainland China, most ethnic minority students today face the challenge of learning three languages in schools, namely, their home language (L1), Mandarin Chinese (L2) and a foreign language, usually English (L3). Research into trilingual education for minority groups has been most active since the turn of the twenty-first century. This paper offers an overview of recent research, depicting major models adopted by minority schools and the contextual factors leading to the models in various minority regions in China. The paper begins with an account of state policies relevant to language provision for minority groups in China, which is followed by a discussion of the outcomes and models of trilingual education. A critical analysis is then made of contextual factors such as ethnolinguistic vitality, history, economy, geopolitics and the changing status of the three languages that affect trilingual education for minority groups. The paper argues that language policymaking in different domains including families, schools, regions and the state should be informed by research evidence on practical models that are effective in meeting the cognitive and affective needs of children from ethnic minority backgrounds."
History	"This article briefly examines a subject repeatedly addressed by historians: the anachronism. Called the historian's ""sin of sins"" by Lucien Febvre, the article shows the current relevance of this issue and underscores the need to be continuously vigilant with respect to this obstacle to historical understanding, particularly since it is capable of assuming the most surprising forms."
Environmental Studies	"In the Paris Agreement, it is stated that country's vulnerability to climate change is a key factor to decide where and how to allocate adaptation funds. However, the distribution of available funds continues to be a controversial point of discussion. To inform this discussion, we look at how policy makers could be differentiating regions for financing countries adaptation needs. We synthesize the results of global vulnerability assessments and conclude that in spite of some agreement between global vulnerability distribution and current funding allocation based on income groups, climate vulnerability remains a nuanced and problematic concept. In a search for increased transparency to inform adaptation financing, we analyze the new risk approach brought forward in recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. A main advantage of this new formulation is a clearer distinction between physical hazards and vulnerability, where vulnerability is solely driven by societal factors. Notwithstanding, the risk approach comes with some shortfalls, not least in terms of scale mismatches. This confirms that more efforts could be devoted in exploring appropriate scales (from both climatological and societal perspectives) and methodologies for embedding the vulnerability approach in a risk framework. However, a prevalent disconnect between science and policy on issues of adaptation financing has so far impeded the shift from earlier formulation of vulnerability to a risk concept in the policy arena. The IPCC has a pivotal role to play in filling this gap by leading a country-level assessment that can serve as a basis for prioritizing adaptation financing. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Communication	"The purpose of this research paper is to characterise mobile-enhanced cognitive job requirements and analyse implications on accounting jobs for performance improvement and human resource management. This paper first develops a mobile cognitive task analysis (MCTA) model based on the human information processing theory, which identifies the cognitive abilities that can be enhanced by mobile devices when performing cognitive-intensive jobs. Second, these mobile cognitive abilities are decomposed into 52 measurable items and assessed by surveys. Data were collected for 50 cognitive-oriented jobs from 400 surveys with 368 valid surveys (92% of valid survey). Third, results from factor analysis indicate that there are nine dimensions of mobile-enhanced cognitive abilities. Fourth, the mobile-enhanced cognitive ability topographies on three accounting jobs (Accountant, Auditor, and Tax Accountant) were constructed based on the weighted factor score analysis, which indicate that the accounting jobs have different requirements on the derived mobile-enhanced cognitive ability intensities. Finally, theoretical and practical implications are also presented in this paper."
Social Issues	"Governments are increasingly eager to involve citizens in co-production of services. They are seen as a substitution or a supplementary resource in service delivery. Citizens' involvement relies heavily on their motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic drivers) to partake in co-production. Taking note from prior debate in the volunteerism literature, the article ties volunteer motivation to the process of co-production and citizen-state interaction. Here the state has contrastive options to motivate citizens' behavior varying between compulsion and coercion. The question is how states' increased engagement and interaction with volunteers affects volunteer motivation and free choice, the main characteristic of volunteerism. To exemplify this, we analyze the motivation behind state engagement in different forms of co-production: volunteering in rescue and police services and in a volunteer program for the unemployed in Estonia. We conclude that using citizens in co-production is rife with controversies that influence the very nature of volunteerism."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of active smoking and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure among medical students in Hong Kong, and their attitudes and beliefs towards tobacco control. Study design: A cross-sectional survey with a self-administrated questionnaire. Methods: All medical students from a university in Hong Kong were invited to participate in this survey and completed structured questionnaires. Descriptive data analyses were performed. Result: In total, 313 medical students participated in this study (response rate 44.7%). Only 7.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3-10.1] reported having ever smoked and 0.7% (95% CI 0-1.6%) were current smokers. ETS exposure at home was reported by 19.3% (95% CI 14.9-23.8) of students, but the proportion of ETS exposure in public places was much higher (61.6%, 95% CI 56.2-67.1%). More than 85% of students had positive attitudes towards tobacco control, but 30.8% (95% CI 25.6-36.0) disagreed with banning smoking in disco/bars/pubs. Although the majority (93.1%, 95% CI 90.3-96.0) of students thought that health professionals should receive specific training for counselling on smoking cessation, only 38.0% (95% CI 32.5-43.5) reported having received any formal training in this area. Conclusions: This study suggests that a specific professional training programme, including counselling on smoking cessation and actions on legislation and tobacco tax policy, should be built into the undergraduate medical curriculum.

Economics	"The goal of this paper is to analyze the relationship between defense expenditures and economic growth in Romania, trying to find out the existence, direction and intensity of this connection. The methods which I used are cluster analysis, quintile analysis, regression technique and Granger causality. The results suggest that in Romania there is a negative correlation. A potential cause of the negative effect of defense expenditures on economic growth in Romania is the high proportion of the spending on equipment and other operational spending. Also I have considered the implications of the budgetary restriction - the limited resources might be given priority for other programs."
Public Administration	"This research highlights two concepts: responsive government and policy agenda as a result of convergence between citizens' priorities and governmental and parliamentary activity, and tries to find evidence to prove a relationship of mutual conditioning between the two concepts. The purpose for such a research is justified by the need for a ""vision of the future"", a concept devoid of academic rigor and, therefore, difficult to define, but which emphasizes, on one hand, the force of a clear strategic intent and, on the other hand, the irreplaceable role in achieving this vision of public policy to meet the legitimate expectations of citizens. On one side, responsiveness in the context of a system can be defined as an outcome that can be achieved when institutions and institutional relationships are designed in such a way that they are cognizant and respond appropriately to the universally legitimate expectations of the citizens. On the other side, we can detect a policy agenda that represents a common place of convergence between citizens' priorities and governmental and parliamentary activity. This convergence is a guarantee that the citizens will receive appropriate and opportune responses to their demands. In other words, the convergence agenda involves the existence of a responsive government."
Ethics	"The enduring innovations in artificial intelligence and robotics offer the promised capacity of computer consciousness, sentience and rationality. The development of these advanced technologies have been considered to merit rights, however these can only be ascribed in the context of commensurate responsibilities and duties. This represents the discernable next-step for evolution in this field. Addressing these needs requires attention to the philosophical perspectives of moral responsibility for artificial intelligence and robotics. A contrast to the moral status of animals may be considered. At a practical level, the attainment of responsibilities by artificial intelligence and robots can benefit from the established responsibilities and duties of human society, as their subsistence exists within this domain. These responsibilities can be further interpreted and crystalized through legal principles, many of which have been conserved from ancient Roman law. The ultimate and unified goal of stipulating these responsibilities resides through the advancement of mankind and the enduring preservation of the core tenets of humanity."
Anthropology	"The aim of this article is to examine the isotopic characterisation of domestic animals as it relates to birthing location and seasonality, diet, pasturing pattern, foddering and climatic conditions of herding and to determine variation between these aspects of cattle and caprine husbandry of the Neolithic Linearbandkultur (LBK) and Trichterbecherkultur (TRB) communities from Kopydlowo in Kujavia-one of the major centres of early farming in the European lowlands. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was undertaken on faunal bone collagen; carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope ratios were measured from tooth enamel. Isotopic signatures may have been caused by different strategies of management of herds of these animal species. Different and more widely distributed carbon, nitrogen and strontium isotopic data for TRB cattle in comparison with its LBK counterparts is indicative of the exploitation of increasingly diverse ecological zones and more varied pastoral practises. The distribution of oxygen isotope values on caprine tooth made it possible to recognise herding seasonality. Irrespective of the chronology, cattle, sheep and goats kept by the inhabitants had C-3 plant-based diet."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Many problems in data management center on relating values to values in other observations, either within a dataset as a. whole or within groups such as panels. This column reviews some basic Stata techniques helpful for such tasks, including the use of subscripts, summarize, by:, sum(), cond(), and egen. Several techniques exploit the fact that logical expressions yield 1 when true and 0 when false. Dividing by zero to yield missings is revealed as a surprisingly valuable device."
Social Issues	"This article presents the outcomes to a study of the charity donation behavior of 771 low-income people residing in three socially deprived Boroughs in inner-London. It emerged that several variables known to affect (a) levels of charity giving and (b) choices of types of charity supported among the U.K. public as a whole also influenced the donation behavior of the financially poor. In addition, it appeared that a participant's sense of affinity with other low-income people and the degree to which the individual believed that the poor were unfairly treated by society at large exerted significant impacts on giving behavior. However behavior differed according to whether a low-income person was ""better-educated"" (i.e., possessed a qualification beyond the level normally obtained at the minimum legal school leaving age) or was less well-educated. The ""very poor"" did not donate a higher percentage of their incomes than the moderately poor."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"The study examined non-travel by Hong Kong residents. Cluster analysis was used to segment the non-travelling population into five groups. Overall, two-thirds of non-travellers indicated that taking a pleasure trip each year is unimportant to them. Yet, when asked to identify barriers to travel, lack of interest is cited rarely. Instead, intrapersonal barriers were identified as the most critical barriers by elderly singles and couples with low incomes. Affordability, work and family commitments were identified by all other groups. Non-travellers simply do not have the travel bug and often have to rely on socially acceptable barriers to rationalise their lack of interest. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Law	"In 2009, state legislatures began to enact concussion safety laws to protect youth athletes suffering from traumatic brain injuries sustained during the course of play. By 2014, all fifty states and the District of Columbia had enacted some form of youth sports concussion legislation. Yet these statutes vary widely across states in terms of the protections offered to youth athletes. This Note provides an analysis of state legislation by classifying all fifty-one statutes among distinct tiers ranging from least to most protective. These laws have generally targeted the secondary risks of concussions, which emerge after a youth athlete has suffered a traumatic brain injury. While the prevention of secondary risks is an important element of concussion management, future legislators should also consider the primary risks of concussions by focusing on reducing the risk of injury before it occurs. This Note advocates that, to ensure the adequate protection of all youth athletes, future legislators must continue to prevent secondary risks by expanding coverage and strengthening enforcement mechanisms. In addition, legislators must address the primary risks of concussions by mandating certain rule changes, which, over time, may begin to transform societal attitudes toward the seriousness of sports-related concussions. While many youth sports organizations and even professional sports leagues have begun to implement certain rule changes to increase player safety, these changes would gain greater efficacy if backed by the force of law. This Note lays out recommendations for a model statute to provide guidance for future legislators."
Law	"My empirical study, which examines neuroscience evidence in 800 criminal cases over the course of two decades, is the first to determine how, when, and why victim brain scan evidence is introduced and used in court. My study reveals that although courts commonly rely on brain scans to show the extent of a victim.'s injury, the actual application of this neuroscience evidence extends far beyond the purpose for which it is admitted. Indeed, victim brain scans are introduced primarily by prosecutors, and nearly half of these cases are based on medical expert testimony that the victims suffer from shaken baby syndrome, a medical diagnosis with controversial scientific underpinnings and distorted legal ramifications. The diagnosis often successfully serves as the sole foundation for a prosecutor's case, with no proof of the defendant's act or intent beyond the victim's brain scan and the accompanying medical expert testimony. Shaken baby syndrome cases thus portray a troubling phenomenon in which the key element of mens rea is either unclear or overlooked altogether and prosecutors are permitted to concoct intent out of brain scans that were admitted for the sole purpose of presenting the victim's injury. My study further reveals that shaken baby syndrome cases are merely the more transparent examples of the criminal justice system's failure to deal adequately with the surging influx of neuroscience evidence into the courtroom. Shaken baby cases thus represent a microcosm of prosecutorial misuse of victim neuroscience evidence more generally, particularly when the evidence is employed to determine a defendant's mental state."
Area Studies	"China's view on the sanctity of state sovereignty has slowly but inexorably been transformed, and the country has found it difficult to continue to adhere to the principles of non-interference and non-intervention with the same degree of rigour as during the Cold War era. This special section will explore what the principles mean to China today; why and how Beijing has become active in peacebuilding and conflict mediation; and what implication China's approach to the principles has for its position in the global liberal order. This article sets the scene by firstly demonstrating that defining the principles has always been a political act, and secondly offering new discussions about how China's expanding economic power forced the country to more actively engage in politics of conflict-affected regions. Finally, it offers a conceptual framework to explain why and how China has become increasingly active in peacebuilding and conflict mediation."

Communication	"Obituary publication has experienced a remarkable revival in the British press during the past 20 years. Newspapers of quality now allocate generous column space on a daily basis, establishing the modern obituary as a literary phenomenon of appreciable magnitude. This shared enthusiasm, however, enjoys a varied manifestation on the pages themselves. That combined surge in column inches, and the consequent influence on public opinion by posthumous appraisal, has been accompanied by scholarly research into obituary publishing. Until now, however, quantitative studies of contemporary practice within the British press have been limited in scope. This article addresses that omission. Drawing on findings from the first large-scale study of its type, it examines 1183 obituaries published by the ""quality quartet'' (Times, Daily Telegraph, Guardian, Independent) over a three-month period (1 March to 31 May 2007), combined with interviews with obituary editors and writers, to determine: style and presentation factors; subject selection by gender and demographic description; the dominant form of reference applied in naming each obituary's central character; contemporaneousness of publication; and the extent to which cause of death is included in the text. In analysing the technique applied by each of these four newspapers, this study reports the policies of their obituary editors, discusses the forces which shape contemporary practice, and creates a platform for further scholarship within the immediate field."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Even though research on tourist souvenirs is quite extensive, it fails to provide a holistic and in-depth perspective on their meanings and their evolution in time and space. Through a symbolic interactionist perspective, the current research aims at filling this gap. We conducted a longitudinal study combining interviews, projective techniques, and observations. Our findings provide a holistic and dynamic approach to tourist souvenirs' meanings by emphasizing their temporal and spatial evolution through three processes. First, we suggest that decontextualization effects and the negative perceptions of some souvenirs may prevent them from entering home. Second, we consider the spatiality of souvenirs within different home areas depending on the meanings they hold for their owners. We also show that the souvenirs' meaningfulness can also be reactivated over time. Third, we emphasize ways meaningless souvenirs may leave the home sphere. Finally, we discuss managerial suggestions and propose avenues of future research."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This research examines Instagram travel influencers' views on their experiences. Using a phenomenological approach, data were collected via semi-structured online interviews with 12 influencers, as well as reflective journals, and document review techniques. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis that define the experiences and perceptions of influencers. The findings were interpreted within the framework of three main themes and were presented with direct citations from participants' statements. The research suggests that being an influencer is a job that requires responsibility and competence. Influencers have a mediating role between the brands and the consumers. It was also found that the job difficulties experienced by the participants include workload, need for approval and impression management. The general means for collaborations between brands and influencers are paid partnership and barter collaborations. For collaborations to be successful, maintaining consistency between the brand image and the impression created by the influencer is vital."
Women'S Studies	"Drawing on Sara Ahmed, this article confronts the often repeated claim that feminists and/or social constructionists - even those whose work appears to focus on 'the body' - routinely ignore the materiality of corporeal life. This charge is often accompanied by the claim that poststructuralist feminists have, for connected reasons, also ignored 'non-human animal' life. This article critically interrogates the ways in which the somatechnics of perception and particular universalizing epistemic sexing practices feed into and out of one another in much contemporary work on 'animal sex'. It also aims to build on Ahmed's critique of the founding gestures of the new materialism in and through a close engagement with the work of a small number of theorists who identify with the new materialism."
Sociology	"In recent decades, there has been much development in research connecting sport and work. It covers a wide range of questions such as how sports organisations operate, the careers of top-level athletes, the growth of an economic sector and its specific jobs, the international migrations of athletes, sexual or racial discrimination in access to the labour market in sport, etc. Here, we place the emphasis on one central dimension of sports activities: competition. Our objective is to analyse the mechanisms of production of sports performance. We consider this to be the outcome of work that does not only involve athletes, with their individual skills, qualities or capacities. We define it as a collective activity that marshals multiple actors, institutions, organisations. Through a variety of activities of judgement, evaluation, recognition, qualification, classification and selection, these actors contribute directly and decisively to producing sports performance. By presenting empirical work that discusses this issue and applies it in varied domains (cycling, rugby, judo, etc.), we call for the development of research into work in sport.

Demography	"This paper analyzes the evolution of women's labor market participation in Spain and the socioeconomic determinants of the probability of finding a job in Spanish women. We used the Labour Force Survey (conducted by the National Statistics Institute) and conducted a survey among a total of 500 Spanish women. The number of employed and unemployed women in the last three quarters of 2014 is predicted using ARIMA models; the probability of finding a job is analyzed using logit models. Overall, the results show some recovery of the women's labor market participation in 2014. Younger women, those with higher education and those without children are more likely to find a job. Besides, this probability rises for part-time jobs y those in the tertiary sector."

Ethics	"Two preregistered studies explored the likelihood paper reviewers would request clarification from authors regarding potential questionable research practices (QRPs). Study 1 participants were instructed to imagine reviewing a journal manuscript as either a coauthor or peer reviewer and rate the extent to which they would request clarification from the author when encountering potential QRPs. Participants reported greater likelihood of requesting clarification when assigned to the coauthor relative to the peer reviewer role. Study 2 participants were assigned to either an anonymous or open-review condition and rated the extent to which they would seek clarification from an author regarding potential QRPs. Men (but not women) in the open review condition reported greater likelihood of seeking clarification about potential QRPs than men in the blind review condition. Results provide tentative evidence that motivational factors influence the peer review process, and suggestions are made for improving peer review practices."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This article measures and compares performance in the accommodation industry across Australian states and territories. The authors specify a Bayesian frontier model and estimate the model using panel data spanning the period 1998 to 2009. The results indicate that there are differences in efficiency across states and territories and also between sectors. Empirical results show that the hotel sector is the most efficient, followed by the guest house and motel sector and, finally, the serviced apartment sector. The Bayesian regression results indicate that the key determinants of efficiency in the accommodation industry are the international attractiveness of the state or territory, the share of large accommodation providers in the sector, and the prevailing economic conditions within the state or territory. The findings that the efficiency measures differ across regions and types of sector indicate that adopting a holistic approach to policy formulation and implementation may not be appropriate to ensure competitiveness of the accommodation industry in Australia."
History	"In this article we propose an institutional perspective on persona formation. Not unlike individual scientists, institutions such as funding bodies took an active interest in shaping the scientific persona. As a case in point, we discuss the Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF) that sent hundreds of aspiring Belgian scientists to the United States during the Interwar Period. The baef went to great lengths to optimise its selection procedure and formulated conditions pertaining to both the mental and physical fitness of its grantees. In this way, the baef cut off some repertoires of being a scientist and encouraged its fellows to demonstrate certain qualities when in front of the funding body. This, we argue, points to the performative and 'occasional' character of scientific personae."
Law	"The legal nature and the jurisdictional control of decisions concerning the declaration and extension of states of exception are constitutionally important questions that, in the Spanish legal system, have raised doubts because of the diverse way in which said decisions are formalised and the lack of any legal provision concerning the jurisdictional body responsible for overseeing them. In this study, I will analyse the particular characteristics of governmental decrees, authorisations and parliamentary resolutions concerning exceptions, which, in the judgement of most accepted legal principles, prevented their classification under a common legal category. I will then identify both the simple and complex proceedings that comprise decisions concerning exceptions for the purposes of their jurisdictional control. Once I have analysed the theoretical context, I will study the decisions contained in the Supreme Court cases that did not admit appeals against the declaration and extension of the state of alert decreed in 2010, in the Constitutional Court proceedings 7/2012 of 13th January and in the important Constitutional Court decision 83/2016 of 28th April that, taking a minority position that defined all of these proceedings under one single category, systematically characterises the decisions concerning the declaration and extensions of states of alert, exception and siege as statutory acts that were only subject to constitutional control."
Social Issues	"Proposed ways of governing climate engineering have most often been supported by narrowly framed and unreflexive appraisals and processes. This article explores the governance implications of a Deliberative Mapping project that, unlike other governance principles, have emerged from an extensive process of reflection and reflexivity. In turn, the project has made significant advances in addressing the current deficit of responsibly defined criteria for shaping governance propositions. Three such propositions argue that (1) reflexive foresight of the imagined futures in which climate engineering proposals might reside is required; (2) the performance and acceptance of climate engineering proposals should be decided in terms of robustness, not optimality; and (3) climate engineering proposals should be satisfactorily opened up before they can be considered legitimate objects of governance. Taken together, these propositions offer a sociotechnical framework not simply for governing climate engineering but for governing responses to climate change at large."
Rehabilitation	This narrative review argues that the current conceptualization of sexuality in exstrophy-epispadias complex research places value on the achievement of sexual function to the detriment of psychosocial factors. It is argued that the adoption of a new conceptualization of sexual health would provide a framework for addressing this concern. This argument is developed through critique of current evidence and supported by further relevant arguments from within health and disability fields. Consideration is given to how potential implications for research and clinical practice arising from this change could be overcome.
Political Science	"This study examines the institutional development of governors' offices. Pooled analyses from 1983 to 2004 indicate that government growth and workload foster institutionalization, as does rivalry with the legislature. Bargaining relationships with external actors appear to have more limited impact. The authors also find that the dispersion of authority within the executive branch plays a significant role in explaining the development of institutionalized staff structures. Overall, the results indicate that separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches affects gubernatorial institutionalization but that researchers should also consider the intercurrencies that exist within the executive branch."
Social Issues	"The intersection between quantum theory, metaphysical spirituality, and Indian-inspired philosophy has an established place in speculative scientific and alternative religious communities alike. There is one term that has historically bridged these two worlds: ""Akasha,"" often translated as ""ether."" Akasha appears both in metaphysical spiritual contexts, most often in ones influenced by Theosophy, and in the speculative scientific discourse that has historically demonstrated a strong affinity for the brand of monistic metaphysics that Indian-derived spiritualities tend to foster. This article traces the relationship between these groups with special attention to the role of Indian concepts and terminology. More specifically, it argues that Akasha-as-ether comes to operate in a manner that bridges gross matter (of which the individual mind is part and parcel) with the notion of a subtle material and transpersonal mind-a version of panpsychism allowing for a coherent quantum monism."
Political Science	"Does an increasing emphasis on individual freedom in mass values erode or revitalize democratic societies? This paper offers a new approach to this debate by examining it through the lens of Isaiah Berlin, and his distinction between positive and negative freedom. I show that, contrary to the common assumption among scholars who study mass values regarding freedom, these do not consist of one dimension but two: negative and positive freedom. I also show that, while valuing negative liberty clearly leads a person to become more morally permissive and more condoning of non-compliance with legal norms, valuing positive liberty does not seem to have the same effects at all; in fact, it shows the very opposite relationship with respect to some of these attitudes. Thus, it matters what kind of freedom people value. The results rely on confirmatory factor and regression analyses on World Values Survey data from ten affluent Western countries in 2005-2006."
Ethics	"The reduced costs of DNA sequencing and the use of such data for HIV-1 clinical management and phylogenetic analysis have led to a massive increase of HIV-1 sequences in the last few years. Phylogenetic analysis has shed light on the origin, spread and characteristics of HIV-1 epidemics and outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis is now also being used to advance our knowledge of the drivers of HIV-1 transmission in order to design effective interventions. However, HIV phylogenetic analysis presents unique ethical challenges, which have not been fully explored. This review presents an analysis of what appear to be key ethical issues in HIV phylogenetics in the hope of stimulating further conceptual and empirical work in this rapidly emerging area. We structure the review using the Emanuel Framework, a systematic, holistic framework, which has been adapted for use in developing countries, which bear the brunt of the HIV-1 pandemic."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"This paper distinguishes three concepts of ""race"": bio-genomic cluster/race, biological race, and social race. We map out realism, antirealism, and conventionalism about each of these, in three important historical episodes: Frank Livingstone and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1962, A. W. F. Edwards's 2003 response to Lewontin's 1972 paper, and contemporary discourse. Semantics is especially crucial to the first episode, while normativity is central to the second. Upon inspection, each episode also reveals a variety of commitments to the metaphysics of race. We conclude by interrogating the relevance of these scientific discussions for political positions and a post-racial future."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"There is much research into occupations, and a growing marked interest in what are called ""new careers."" These new careers, which are defined in relation to traditional occupations. are typified by lower loyalty and less attachment to the employer on the part of the employee. There are various factors that account for this. From a sociological viewpoint, modern workers tend to need to give a sense to their professional life and so. depending on the moment and their desires, they change organization and accumulate diverse experiences over the Course of their career. Economically, with the Ubiquity Of Corporate restructuring and organizational change, employees aim to protect themselves from the risk of redundancy having come to the realization that jobs for life no longer exist. These changes correspond to a new. more contractual and more rational. psychological relationship between the individual and the organization. This means that in the new areas of exchange. loyalty and reciprocity are maintained through the Synchronous realization of expectations. As a result, attachment to the organization and emotional investment are weaker than was the case in the past. While being both justified and pertinent, the above mentioned research engenders a particular viewpoint. Through a Certain prioritization, this research has lead to an almost total neglect of research into sin-le-employer careers and into long-term employment relationships which were historically the basis of an employee's relation with the organization. Although single-employer careers have not disappeared, it Must be admitted that nowadays they have taken oil a new form. Internal reorganization and permanent changes have contributed to a redefinition of the conditions of long-term employment relationships. They also Contribute to the modification of the rules of involvement and the transformation of the relationship between contribution and remuneration. This leads to the question of the longevity of the commitment of those who choose to stay with one organization. It is to this rarely investigated question that this article is addressed. This article analyses the Sustainable employment relationship in order to understand the motives for the commitment of the actors engaged in such a relationship. The Study is based on an ethnographic Survey which was conducted over fifteen months within the firm France Telecom. Over the last fifteen years. this firm has Undergone major restructurings which has had as a result that the firm's employees work in a professional and social framework that is different from the one in place when they joined the company. The legal status, the meaning given to their work. the values as well as the job itself have all been redefined to match the new obligations of the organization. Classic management approaches consider that undergone changes in conditions induce hitches or even a rupture of the psychological contract. They also show that these hitches in the exchanges between employer and employee go along with negative consequences oil the employees' commitment, their loyalty. their social behaviour. and their performance (Delobbe et al., 2005). Studies oil the psychological contract have mainly highlighted the fact that, Under Such circumstances, most employees resign. Our research seeks to understand what causes employees to maintain their involvement even when their employment conditions have been radically redefined. To do this, we start with the paradoxes seen in our study. At France Telecom, even when those involved have under-one professional reorientation, moving them away frorn their previous experiences, none of them wish to leave the company. The behaviour of the individuals and the performance of the company show a strong commitment to the company and to the work oil the part of the employees. The inductive survey reveals that the reasons For a lasting/long-term commitment are grounded in and protected by the history of the relationship that links the employees to the firm (primary socialization, protection of traditional values, behaviour Standards, Social dependence) and also by a great number of mixed features that are specific to lasting/long-term employment relationships (strong identity roots. affection for the, firm. etc.). The paradigm of gift/counter-gift (don/contre-don) and of the. social phenomenon initiated by Marcel Mauss ( 1923-19-24) is used here to analyze this type of relationship. This paradigm allows as to take into account the complexity of the relationship. the dynamics of the different features considered and. most importantly. the role of the lasting/long-term Interaction between the employee and the particular context of the relationship. Moreover. it allows us to better understand the Issues raised by reorganization for those involved. Using the results of the Survey. the article confirms that Mauss' gift/counter-gift paradigm is relevant to the analysis and Understanding of lasting/long-term employment relationships. It also proves that Mauss' theories are particularly inuminating and of a great interest for human resource Management. showing that they complement the traditional management approaches as they define new conditions for the Support programmes implemented by the Firm in order to be efficient. In this article. we put forward the concept of a ""chain giving."" This concept emphasizes the overall and historic dimensions of the relation with the enterprise. It encourages the measurement Of all the implications involved in long-term employment relationships (professional, personal and social implications) and their incorporation into managerial decision making. This concept can bring us a clearer rading of the expectations of the individual, comprehension of the paradoxes observed it the workface and a deepening of our Understanding of reactions to changes Put in place by organizations."
Business	"This study considers the influence of contracts on enforcement and the subsequent performance impact of aligned and misaligned enforcement. We define enforcement as a corrective action aimed at remedying problems occurring in the transaction. First we explain the role of contracts and show that at the component level, contracts can both increase and decrease enforcement. Building on an alignment perspective and accounting for the endogeneity of enforcement, we use these contractual components and variables related to enforcement to predict the occurrence of enforcement. We use such predictions to show that aligned enforcement results in higher performance. We also show that the performance impact of misaligned enforcement is relatively greater for transactions where enforcement is not expected. We conduct the study using a unique dataset reporting on 971 business transactions across a wide range of industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"An increasing number of hotels are altering their operations proactively to include more environmentally friendly practices. Despite the greater interest in consumers' green behaviors, the theoretical application of the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory has been used only rarely to investigate consumers' intentions to visit a green hotel. The purpose of this study was to expand existing knowledge of hotel consumers' green behaviors by developing and testing an extended VBN theory used in the hospitality literature. More specifically, this study incorporated subjective norms and green trust into the original VBN model as a theoretical framework to understand comprehensively consumers' decision-making processes with respect to their intentions to visit a green hotel. A web-based survey was used to collect data from a convenience sample of faculty members working at an institution of higher education in the Midwestern United States who have been lodging consumers. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypotheses. The results showed that all but subjective norms were successful in explaining consumers' decision-making processes regarding their intentions to visit a green hotel. The results can assist hotel managers in the adoption and implementation of hotel operations based on the needs of environmentally conscious consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This article uses data from the recently compiled Public Workforce System Dataset to assess the response of selected federal workforce programs to the 2007-2009 recession. The analysis indicates that these programs responded quickly to the economic downturn, providing timely relief for a large number of unemployed workers. Supplemental funding secured through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also enabled federal workforce programs and state agencies to pay benefits for longer durations and to offer expanded training and reemployment services to program participants."
Rehabilitation	"Background. Identifying occupational performance issues is an essential component of the occupational therapy process. Little attention has been paid to therapists' management of this aspect of geriatric practice. Purpose. This study explored therapists' approach to identifying occupational performance issues (OPI) with older adults. Methods. Information gathered from semi-structured interviews was analyzed using Polkinghorne's (1995) analysis of narrative method. Findings. The study demonstrated how therapists prepare clients to engage in the OPI identification process; use interviewing strategies to build trust; and tap into client narratives to foster hope in occupational possibilities. Implications. Findings suggest that therapists require a complex set of highly skilled strategies to engage clients in OPI identification through tapping into aspects of the client's motivational influences, occupational histories, therapy expectations, and generational attitudes about aging. Further study is required to identify ways to overcome structural barriers to more occupational and narrative-based approaches to identifying occupational performance issues."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This study focuses on domestic tourists at a World Heritage Site located in China and investigates the relationship of three important visitor perceptions (i.e., service fairness, destination image, and service quality) with tourism destination loyalty (i.e., positive word-of-mouth referrals and revisit intentions) through overall destination satisfaction and trust toward destination service providers. The structural equation modeling findings generally support the conceptual model and indicate that service fairness and service quality have a significant and positive impact on overall destination satisfaction and trust toward destination service providers, while destination image has a significant effect on overall destination satisfaction but not on trust toward destination service providers. In addition, the investigated perceptions-loyalty relationships are found to be mediated by overall destination satisfaction, but not necessarily by trust toward destination service providers. The paper includes discussions of the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"In this article, I introduce the ldagibbs command, which implements latent Dirichlet allocation in Stata. Latent Dirichlet allocation is the most popular machine-learning topic model. Topic models automatically cluster text documents into a user-chosen number of topics. Latent Dirichlet allocation represents each document as a probability distribution over topics and represents each topic as a probability distribution over words. Therefore, latent Dirichlet allocation provides a way to analyze the content of large unclassified text data and an alternative to predefined document classifications."
Development Studies	"This article argues that the recent Ebola crisis is the result of structural violence, as interlocking institutions have produced interlaced inequalities, unsustainabilities and insecurities. These have underlain the vulnerabilities in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea through which a disease outbreak became a major health, social and economic crisis and the local fears, distrust, rumours and resistance that magnified it further. Articulating this analysis of Ebola with broader perspectives, the case is made for a reframing of post-2015 development as transformational politics towards equality, sustainability and security, enabling people to realise well-being and justice in terms that make sense to them.

Substance Abuse	"Although 12-step literature posits inconsiderate behaviors to characterize alcoholics and addicts, there is little data to support this association among adolescent populations. Using a matched-pair study design with 579 youths ages 14 to 18 (52% female, 30% minority), a significant, dose-response relationship was found between greater alcohol and drug use severity and increased likelihood of driving under the influence, having unprotected sex with and without a history of sexually transmitted incidence, and low volunteerism among boys. Findings suggest that alcohol and drug use severity is associated with poor awareness of the impact of behaviors on others."
Ethics	"Intellectual property is one of the highly divisive issues in contemporary philosophical and political debates. The main objective of this paper is to explore some sources of tension between the formal rules of intellectual property (particularly copyright and patents) and the emerging informal norms of file sharing and open access in online environments. We look into the file sharing phenomena not only to illustrate the deepening gap between the two sets of norms, but to cast some doubt on the current regime of intellectual property as an adequate frame for the new type of interactions in online environments. Revisiting the classic Arrow-Demsetz debate about intellectual property and the epistemological issues involved in assessing institutions, we suggest that seeking out new institutional arrangements aligned with the norms-in-use seems to be a more promising strategy in the new technological setting than attempting to reinforce the current legal framework. Moreover, such a strategy is less prone to committing the so-called Nirvana fallacies'. As a secondary task, we try to cast some doubt on the two most common moral justifications of intellectual property as being able to ground the full extent of the current intellectual property regime."
Law	"This paper examines how providing litigants with information about arbitrators'' win/loss ratios affects arbitrators'' incentives in deciding the cases before them in an impartial and unbiased manner. We show that if litigants are informed about arbitrators'' past decisions, then arbitrators might want to make an incorrect decision when a correct decision would raise the suspicion that they are biased. Therefore, providing information about arbitrators'' past decisions might create adverse incentive effects and reduce the accuracy of arbitration. We compare the accuracy of arbitrators'' decisions under different arbitrator selection procedures and discuss the implications for the design of arbitration rules by arbitration and dispute resolution providers and by court-administered arbitration programs."
Business	"Are workplaces with a high percentage of women in management run differently? This paper uses data from the British 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS98) to analyze empirically the relationship between the percentage of female workplace managers and people-management practices. The results show that workplace management teams with a higher proportion of women monitor employee feedback and development more intensely. Such teams also tend to promote more interpersonal channels of communication and more employee participation in decision-making, although the evidence is weaker for these last two practices. Overall, the findings suggest that the concept of good workplace management practices converges on female leadership styles when the percentage of female managers increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Substance Abuse	"Areca nut (AN), commonly known as ""Supari"" in India is an addictive substance and widely consumed with or without tobacco as a part of customs in many South East Asian countries. Owing to the adverse health effects of AN, public awareness and stringent government policies to prohibit AN production and regulation of products containing AN should be addressed without further delay. Lack of a research database, motivated us to develop a comprehensive online portal on global survey of published articles with reference to AN. The Areca nut database (ANDB) is a manually curated database which provides the information on global literature according to the publication year, author, population, harmful effects, and associated disease. The present study is an attempt to deliver the relevant information which would be helpful to researchers in prioritizing the research areas with respect to AN and associated health effects. The portal has been developed in MySQL and the interface has been designed using core PhP and CSS, HTML. ANDB is an online resource available to provide global literature of AN in a user-friendly manner. It can be accessed freely on . To the best of our knowledge, ANDB is the first portal delivering inclusive scientific literature related to AN and its health effects. This evidence-based scientific information would be useful for policy makers to make guidelines for increasing awareness and implementing the laws for regulated use of this potentially carcinogenic substance, thereby controlling the burden of many dreaded diseases primarily oral submucous fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancers."
Social Work	"This paper explores the notable rise of cynicism among state social workers in Britain. Theoretically, cynicism has been viewed as 'deviant emotion' and pathology or as offering a type of employee resistance that may protect or support a person's identity. Drawing upon case study research with practising social workers, the article looks at three different case examples of employee cynicism. These include the cynic as organisational survivor, disenfranchised sceptic or altruist. It was found that, although cynicism within social work predominately emerges as an emotional response to structural change, other factors such as those embodied within professional discourses and government or academic rhetoric can also impact. Other factors such as risk-averse assumptions that distance the practitioner from the 'service user' or colleagues can also have influence. Although often viewed negatively, cynicism can greatly benefit an organisation or motivate a practitioner to challenge normative principles and promote the needs of service users and carers."
Management	"There has been very little research done in logistics service on how its quality is defined and attributed. In this paper, we aim to explore the definition of the concept of quality in logistics service and its associated dimensions by constructing a conceptual model and test it empirically. A survey was conducted in Singapore with 2333 logistics service providers and customers from Singapore Logistics Association and Singapore's National Shipper Council. A total of 171 questionnaires including 86 from logistics service providers and 85 customers were returned. After the process of exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis, we found that the revised model of five factors and 20 items of logistics service quality (LSQ) is valid and reliable to measure the quality of logistics service. It was also indicated from the study that the quality of customer focus is deemed the most critical to enhance the perceived LSQ."
Transportation	"Information produced by travel demand models plays a large role decision making in many metropolitan areas, and San Francisco is no exception. Being a transit first city, one of the most common uses for San Francisco's travel model SF-CHAMP is to analyze transit demand under various circumstances. SF-CHAMP v 4.1 (Harold) is able to capture the effects of several aspects of transit provision including headways, stop placement, and travel time. However, unlike how auto level of service in a user equilibrium traffic assignment is responsive to roadway capacity, SF-CHAMP Harold is unable to capture any benefit related to capacity expansion, crowding's effect on travel time nor or any of the real-life true capacity limitations. The failure to represent these elements of transit travel has led to significant discrepancies between model estimates and actual ridership. Additionally it does not allow decision-makers to test the effects of policies or investments that increase the capacity of a given transit service. This paper presents the framework adopted into a more recent version of SF-CHAMP (Fury) to represent transit capacity and crowding within the constraints of our current modeling software."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Longitudinal data are collected for studying changes across time. We consider multivariate longitudinal data where multiple observed variables, measured at each time point, are used as indicators for theoretical constructs (latent variables) of interest. A common problem in longitudinal studies is dropout, where subjects exit the study prematurely. Ignoring the dropout mechanism can lead to biased estimates, especially when the dropout is nonrandom. Our proposed approach uses latent variable models to capture the evolution of the latent phenomenon over time while also accounting for possibly nonrandom dropout. The dropout mechanism is modeled with a hazard function that depends on the latent variables and observed covariates. Different relationships among these variables and the dropout mechanism are studied via 2 model specifications. The proposed models are used to study people's perceptions of women's work using 3 questions from 5 waves from the British Household Panel Survey."
Women'S Studies	"This article examines the development of a women's movement in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. It describes the types of activities and the strategies of different women activists, as well as highlighting the main divisions among them. The article also discusses the various ways in which the ongoing occupation and escalating violence in Iraq has shaped women's activism and the object of their struggles. Communal and sectarian tensions had been fostered by the previous regime as well as by the political opposition in exile prior to 2003, but the systematic destruction of national institutions, such as the army and the police, by the occupation forces, has led to a flare-up of the sectarian conflict. The article concludes by evaluating women's activism in terms of its contributions to conflict on the one hand and national reconciliation on the other."
Urban Studies	"Located amidst the European Alps, the Austrian city of Innsbruck has developed from a small Roman settlement into a centre for the House of Habsburg. Today the self-styled ""Capital of the Alps""-host to the Winter Olympics in 1964 and 1976 is a vibrant urban region that aims to valorize the mountains to face the post-Fordist competition between urban centres. The present article traces the urban development of Innsbruck, from Roman times to the present, focusing on the age of post-Fordism and globalization. Looking beyond the administrative boundaries of the core city, data on land cover and demographic conditions for the whole urban region of Innsbruck is described and explained. Next, the pivotal role that tourism and, in particular, cable cars have been playing in the urban development of Innsbruck since the late 1920s, is analysed and linked with ongoing trends in place branding. From both internal and external perspectives, Innsbruck is shown as promoting itself as an Alpine-urban city that provides a postmodern leisure society with optimal conditions for work and leisure at different altitudinal zones. The increasingly urbanized high-mountain environment is becoming a core element of the place brand of Innsbruck."
Linguistics	"This paper sets out to contribute to the debate on the morpho-syntactic status of phonologically weak or clitic subject pronouns in Colloquial French by discussing finite impersonal constructions in which the expletive subject pronoun is non-expressed. The paper provides arguments against an approach in terms of inflectional affixes, showing that the non-expression of this pronoun is in fact syntactically restricted. On the basis of the further finding that the non-expression of the expletive represents the continuation of a grammatical trait of older stages of the language in which the non-expression of subject pronouns was generally possible, a tentative proposal is put forward which crucially draws on information structure."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Using a general notion of convex order, we derive general lower bounds for risk measures of aggregated positions under dependence uncertainty, and this in arbitrary dimensions and for heterogeneous models. We also prove sharpness of the bounds obtained when each marginal distribution has a decreasing density. The main result answers a long-standing open question and yields an insight in optimal dependence structures. A numerical algorithm provides bounds for quantities of interest in riskmanagement. Furthermore, our numerical results suggest that the bounds obtained in this paper are generally sharp for a broader class of models."
Sociology	"The article presents the sociological reconstruction of images of Slovakia and Slovaks used by Polish local elites in Southern Poland. The analysis is based on the qualitative data from three borderland towns. The theoretical concept of space as the social construct and S. Ossowski's idea of the neighbourhood distance, led to mapping of structure of different local imaginations of Slovakia and their position in the general concept of locality used by the respondents."
History Of Social Sciences	"In a context where European integration is put into question, under the weight of external (migration, safety issues, economic) and centrifugal forces (Brexit, growing Euroscepticism), European spatial planning has been somewhat sidelined in the debates on the European Union's goals, cohesion and future. This special issue aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of these dynamics by revisiting the history of European spatial planning - from its origins, gradual institutionalization to its current rolling back - by exploring it both at the European and the national level, stressing its difficulties and idiosyncrasies. The conceptual framework of historical institutionalism is used across the papers in an attempt to shed more light on this processes, through the analysis of critical junctures and path dependency of planning and cohesion agendas, transnational networks as well as changes to the national institutions and planning systems. This tightly woven collection of papers touches upon not only the underlying arguments for European cohesion, but also the questions about the future of European spatial planning as an 'EU microcosm' in light of current discussions concerning democratic credentials and legitimacy of the EU project as a whole."
Political Science	"Scholars have argued that by spurring parental involvement in school activities, school choice creates social capital. While government policies may be able to create social capital, we doubt that school choice is such a policy and argue that participation in school activities is largely determined by individual-level attributes and the school context, rather than choice per se. To assess this claim we use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study data. Unlike most school choice studies, this data set has a large, representative national sample. More importantly, the panel structure of the data allows us to examine the same parents both before and after the school choice decision has been made, permitting a true dynamic analysis. The results demonstrate that actively choosing a child's school does not make parents more likely to participate in school activities. Some institutional attributes of schools do appear to increase parental involvement in school activities, however."
Information Science & Library Science	"Background: Considerable barriers still prevent paediatricians from successfully using information retrieval technology. Objectives: To verify whether the assistance of biomedical librarians significantly improves the outcomes of searches performed by paediatricians in biomedical databases using real-life clinical scenarios. Methods: In a controlled trial at a paediatric teaching hospital, nine residents and interns were randomly allocated to an assisted search group and nine to a non-assisted (control) group. Each participant searched PUBMED and other online sources, performing pre-determined tasks including the formulation of a clinical question, retrieval and selection of bibliographic records. In the assisted group, participants were supported by a librarian with 5 years of experience. The primary outcome was the success of search sessions, scored against a specific assessment tool. Results: The median score of the assisted group was 73.6 points interquartile range (IQR = 13.4) vs. 50.4 (IQR = 17.1) of the control group. The difference between median values in the results was 23.2 points (95% CI 4.8-33.2), in favour of the assisted group (P-value, Mann-Whitney U test: 0.013). Conclusions: The study has found quantitative evidence of a significant difference in search performance between paediatric residents or interns assisted by a librarian and those searching the literature alone."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"In earlier work, we showed that, for any given year, England's secondary school league tables poorly predict schools' future performances. We generalize our prediction formula to calculate predictions based on multiple years of school league table data and show that this does very little to improve precision. This reinforces the conclusion of our earlier work: school league tables are unreliable and misleading guides for school choice and that this is still the case even if several years of school league table data are considered."
Cultural Studies	"The concern about South African arts being - as Achille Mbembe claims - 'stuck in repetition' can be challenged by examining developments in the performance arts which deliberately employ repetition. In these cases repetition is played with not just as a process of voiding or emptying out, but also to reconceptualise and embody historical and lived experiences. This can involve re-enactments of images, texts and theatrical styles which are worked upon and productively problematised through performance as a live event. In looking at the performance aesthetics of repetition, Diana Taylor's The archive and the repertoire (2003) provides a useful context, since Taylor's work straddles the disciplinary intersections between performance studies, anthropology and history. As point of departure, this article focuses on three works produced at the 2012 National Arts Festival, since the accumulation of new and not-new works viewed in quick succession offers scope for identifying aesthetic trends and shifts. Brett Bailey's Exhibit A, Yael Farber's Mies Julie, and Omphile Molusi's Itsoseng, for instance, demonstrate various aspects of an aesthetics of repetition. The embodied histories that are performed in these works throw up a number of paradoxes. However, the productions do not simply circulate performing bodies as empty aesthetic images, but as transmitters of cultural memory, as well as witnesses to states of profound transition that engage both performers and audiences alike."
Anthropology	"Objectives: Internal bone structure, both cortical and trabecular bone, remodels in response to loading and may provide important information regarding behavior. The foot is well suited to analysis of internal bone structure because it experiences the initial substrate reaction forces, due to its proximity to the substrate. Moreover, as humans and apes differ in loading of the foot, this region is relevant to questions concerning arboreal locomotion and bipedality in the hominoid fossil record. Materials and methods: We apply a whole-bone/epiphysis approach to analyze trabecular and cortical bone in the distal tibia and talus of Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens. We quantify bone volume fraction (BV/TV), degree of anisotropy (DA), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), bone surface to volume ratio (BS/BV), and cortical thickness and investigate the distribution of BV/TV and cortical thickness throughout the bone/epiphysis. Results: We find that Pan has a greater BV/TV, a lower BS/BV and thicker cortices than Homo in both the talus and distal tibia. The trabecular structure of the talus is more divergent than the tibia, having thicker, less uniformly aligned trabeculae in Pan compared to Homo. Differences in dorsiflexion at the talocrural joint and in degree of mobility at the talonavicular joint are reflected in the distribution of cortical and trabecular bone. Discussion: Overall, quantified trabecular parameters represent overall differences in bone strength between the two species, however, DA may be directly related to joint loading. Cortical and trabecular bone distributions correlate with habitual joint positions adopted by each species, and thus have potential for interpreting joint position in fossil hominoids."
Linguistics	"This article explores communication and miscommunication in Japanese university settings, in English-medium classroom situations where the students are Japanese and the instructor is a native', generally Inner Circle, speaker of English. The focus of the analysis is on two aspects of classroom style that are affected by teacher's and students' divergent norms of interaction and interpretation: (1) turn-taking behavior, especially student non-responsiveness represented by an abundance of silence; and (2) forms of address, particularly the names, with or without a title, that students use in calling their teachers. The article is influenced by, and seen as an extension of, Larry E. Smith's work on English for cross-cultural communication and discourse across cultures."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"The article seeks to develop an account of the transformation of hunger and the structural violence of Apartheid into biopolitical concerns in South Africa from 1994 to 2010. I argue that the post-Apartheid politics of hunger and nutrition make no sense in South Africa outside of the politics of HIV, and that those histories of hunger and malnutrition have been radically transformed during this period such that it is now not possible to think about nutrition beyond or apart from biomedicalised knowledge of nutrition, immune system functioning and the gut. I show that the gastrointestinal tract has emerged as a central object of concern for the making of credible scientific advances, and at the same time for articulating the symbolic importance of the belly in the development of a biopolitical concern with food, nutrition and HIV. By focusing on one locale in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in which hunger, diet, nutrition and food are conjoined with immune system functioning, treatment regimes and bodily capacity, the article parses out the matters of concern that have produced nutrition, the immune system and the gut as specific nodes of action and enquiry within the particularities of post-Apartheid, 'epidemic' South Africa."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"What are the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms that constitute diversity in the fabric of social relationships across the lifespan? Interpersonal functioning across the lifespan reflects principles of life-course sociology, and evolutionary life history theory. Variability, elasticity and dynamics of interpersonal contexts across the lifespan reflect the capability of humans to adapt to challenges and constraints of their environment. We submit an integrative framework of relationship regulation across the lifespan that builds on two basic psychological principles of social behavior: the regulation of closeness and the monitoring of reciprocity. The two mechanisms are illustrated in relation to age-specific demands and challenges across the lifespan. We discuss the interplay, salience and functions of the two principles of relationship regulation with respect to specific adaptive effects of social relationships in different lifespan contexts.

Business	"The distinction between domestic and international market activities has an idiosyncratic meaning for international business research. This study examines the significant yet unclear role of domestic market activities for the internationalizing firm through the theoretical lens of exploitation and exploration. By means of five qualitative case studies, we show that both the dynamics between domestic-international market activities and the interplay between exploitation-exploration are intrinsically concerned with synergies and tensions. Our findings uncover how firms leverage these synergies and manage these tensions that manifest between and within their domestic and international markets. Synergies and tensions are found to revolve around ambidexterity, networks and organizational market information processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Substance Abuse	"Background: Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), an evidence-based validated system for providing early detection and brief treatment of substance use disorders, has been widely used in the training of medical residents across specialties at a number of sites. This article investigates the effectiveness of SBIRT training during short-term follow-up at Albany Medical Center, one of the initial Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) grantees. Methods: Training outcomes were measured by training satisfaction following opportunities to apply SBIRT skills in clinical work, the rate at which these techniques were applied in clinical work, and the degree to which residents felt that the SBIRT training provided skills that were applicable to their practice. We examined differences in learning experience by postgraduate year and by program, and conducted a qualitative analysis in a convergent parallel mixed-methods design to elucidate barriers encountered by residents upon using SBIRT techniques in clinical practice. Results: Residents remained highly satisfied with the training at 4-month follow-up, with 80.1% reporting that they had used SBIRT skills in their clinical work. Use of SBIRT techniques was high at 6-month follow-up as well, with 85.9% of residents reporting that they regularly screened their patients for substance use, 74.4% reporting that they had applied brief intervention techniques, and 78.2% indicating that SBIRT training had made them overall more effective in helping patients with substance use issues. Differences in application rates and satisfaction were found by specialty. Qualitative analyses indicated that residents encountered patient readiness and specific contextual factors, such as time constraints, externally imposed values, and clinical norms, as barriers to implementation. Conclusions: Despite encountering obstacles such as time constraints and patient readiness, residents utilized many of the skills they had learned during SBIRT training in clinical practice and reported finding these skills useful in their management of patients with substance use issues."
Health Policy & Services	"Objectives: The evidence of improved survival in patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving multidisciplinary team (MDT) care remains inconclusive. Methods: All patients with incident CRC but no prior cancer history in 2005-2008 were included and followed till 2010. A logistic regression model was used to predict the associated factors to participate in the MDT care model. The propensity score method was included under Cox proportional hazards model to reduce potential bias and to conduct survival analyses. Results: In total, 25,766 patients were included; the mean follow-up period was 35.1 months. The factors associated with participating in MDT included receiving treatments at regional hospitals, at private hospitals, and stage III cancer (all p values <0.001). The favorable survival factors included participating in MDT (HR = 0.91, p = 0.001), age of 45-75, top-ranked income group, receiving treatments at district hospitals, or at hospitals or with doctors that had higher service volumes (all p values <0.05). Regarding individual stages, the risk of mortality was significantly lower at stage IV (HR = 0.88, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Colorectal cancer patients with participation in MDT have a lower mortality risk; the improvements of survival exist in all colorectal cancer patients, especially in those with stage IV disease.

Anthropology	"This paper presents camel remains identified in Roman sites in Serbia. The remains originate from Viminacium, the capital of Roman province Moesia, and from the 3rd-4th century villa rustica in the locality of Vranj, in the province of Pannonia. In Viminacium, they were found in a 4th century dump, near the Eastern necropolis of the city, and in the 4th century layers in the area of the amphitheatre. In order to conclude whether these bones belonged to Camelus dromedarius or Camelus bactrianus, measurements and morphology of our specimens were compared with camel bones found at other Roman sites, and with modern specimens. We have identified two-humped camels and also hybrid individuals. The role of the camels is also discussed here: whether they were used in public games (ludi), for military purposes, or as transportation animals. As a conclusion, we acknowledge that camels were not rare animals in Roman provinces as it was considered before."
Economics	"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors influencing intent to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles for use in agricultural operations in Jilin Province, China. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses probit analysis to estimate the influence of factors on intent to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles for plant protection application operations in Jilin Province, China based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Findings UAV technology is acceptable to most participating farmers. Gender (male), agricultural income ratio, understanding of new technology, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness have a positive relationship with farmers"" willingness to adopt UAVs. Practical implications For application, crop monitoring and other farm operations, UAVs have clear advantages. There remain challenges associated with the development of applicable technology and facilitating adoption among farmers. Understanding factors affecting adoption will contribute to the latter, and brings forth the following recommendations: conduct research on the cost effectiveness of UAVs for agriculture; accelerate development of the information service system; and increase financial support. Originality/value This paper is among the first to consider adoption intent among Chinese farmers of use of UAVs for agricultural operations."
Public Administration	"This article addresses an important question: do nonprofit organizations have an advantage over public organizations in fostering individual-organizational value congruence? The authors argue that nonprofit organizations do have an advantage. This is because institutional differences between the two sectors become manifest through nonprofit status and the extent of external control, which influences the organization and the individual. External control and sector status (nonprofit versus public) determine the extent of centralization, organizational goal ambiguity, and work autonomy. In turn, these three organizational characteristics shape individual-organizational value congruence. Although the results provide support for the nonprofit advantage thesis, it is worth noting that organizational effects on individual-organizational value congruence are more powerful. Indeed, the results suggest that managerial and organizational actions, compared with sector status, are more likely to influence individual-organizational value congruence."

Geography	"Resolution No. 2 of the last EUREF symposium, held in May 2009 in Florence, highlights the importance of the INSPIRE Directive, along with that of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) and the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) for this directive. A milestone in its implementation in Slovenia is the date January 1 2008, when the survey for the land cadastre database within the new national coordinate system was launched. The second phase has yet to be implemented, i.e. the starting of the maintenance of real estate databases within the new national coordinate system. The second phase requires the transformation of all real estate databases into the new national coordinate system. Because of their interconnectedness, they must be treated as a whole."
Development Studies	"At the Olympic Games, there is an increasing gap between developed countries that are investing more and more government resources into sporting success, and developing countries that cannot afford the Gold War, and are just spectators in the medal race. Based on studying a representative case, Lebanon, I investigate issues and interests of developing countries in the Olympics. On the political level, the main motivation for participation is global recognition. On the sporting level, developing countries seek to use Olympic participation as preparation for regional Games where success is more likely, serving as a soft power tool for regional influence."
Environmental Studies	"The purpose of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of farmland loss and fragmentation and to explore factors that may influence that loss and fragmentation. The study examined changes to farmland in a context of rapid urbanization in Changzhou City, China. It also examined farmland changes in the suburban areas outside the city and in the exurban regions. Time series data from 2004 to 2011 were used to conduct spatial analysis using landscape indices and to perform a redundancy analysis. The results found that farmland was steadily declining during the study period. Farmland also became increasingly fragmented and it moved from low elevation and a gentle slope terrain to higher elevation and a steep slope terrain while its center of gravity generally moved northward. China's farmland protection policy, agricultural production level, and terrain conditions contributed most to farmland loss and fragmentation in the city. Farmland loss and fragmentation in the suburb and exurbs were influenced mostly by prime farmland area, total population, and per capita net income of rural residents. To control farmland loss and fragmentation, laws regarding its conversion to built-up environments,should be enforced. China's overall land-use plan and laws of farmland protection are presently the best ways to effectively protect farmland loss and fragmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This study aimed to examine age-related changes in gratitude expression and spending preferences and the associations between children's greatest wish and gratitude expression. Participants were 285 children of ages 7 to 14 (M = 10.87, SD = 2.27, 54% girls) from public and private schools in Porto Alegre, a large urban center of Brazil. We found that verbal gratitude was the most common type of gratitude expression. Older children were more likely to express verbal and less likely to express concrete gratitude than were younger participants; they were also more likely to choose saving money for the future and less likely to choose donating to the poor. We also found a positive correlation between hedonistic wishes and concrete gratitude and between social well-being wishes and connective gratitude. Our results suggest that gratitude is linked to the ability of thinking about others, and may be hindered by a focus on immediate pleasure."
Development Studies	"It is commonly argued that 'institutions matter' for growth and poverty reduction. While recognising the importance of institutions, it is necessary to go 'beyond institutions' in understanding the factors that promote growth and poverty reduction. This paper draws on the research findings of the IPPG Research Consortium (Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth), some of which are included in this issue, to make the following arguments. We argue, first, that the ways in which economic, political and social institutions interact are crucial in shaping pro-poor development outcomes. Secondly, the establishment of effective institutions also requires the building and strengthening of effective social, political and economic organizations, across sectors and issue areas, which can push for, negotiate, implement and monitor locally appropriate and legitimate institutional arrangements if the aim of poverty reduction is to have sustained traction as a policy goal.

"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This article presents an argument for how to generalize from a single case study evaluation of a social programme or policy, focusing on two essential elements of case study - context and particularity. Taking an interpretivist perspective and drawing on artistic and humanistic ways of understanding, it examines both different ways of generalizing from the case that retain a connection with the context in which they first arose and how we generalize by direct encounter with the particular. This argument is not new. It has its origins in earlier centuries and, in contemporary evaluation, dating back to the 1970s. However, in a political climate that privileges evaluation approaches stemming from large sample studies and experimental designs, it seems timely to restate the value of generalizing from the single case. Grounded in the reality of programme experience and retaining that connection with context and particulars in the case facilitates the use of evaluation knowledge."
Public Administration	"Budgeting is an important mechanism for ensuring public accountability. How do budget reforms in the United States during the Progressive Era compare to those in contemporary China? Are administrative and legislative budget controls essential to an effective, efficient government? Though the two countries differ in many respects, significant parallels between their budget reforms are evident. In the United States, electoral accountability alone does not guarantee overall government accountability if proper budgetary institutions are absent. China's recent budget reform reveals that it is possible to develop accountability, absent open elections, but with limitations and constraints. Lessons on budgeting and accountability for other developing and transitional countries are drawn from this comparative study."
Linguistics	"This first part of this paper argues against the assumption that trial examination consists of question-answer patterns. Rather, data from cross-examination in a criminal trial reveals the existence of an objection option space that screens questions for evidential relevance. When activated, the option space transforms the micro social organization and participation structure of the court in officially sanctioned ways. Unofficially, however, both witness and judge deploy forms of multimodal conduct as an affective stance to comment on the objected-to-questions and signal egregious evidentiary violations to the non-questioning attorney and jury, undermining the credibility of the questioning attorney. The second part of the paper analyzes an objection conference after the judge dismisses the jury to consider the questioning attorney's litany of evidentiary violations. The only effective cross-examination in the entire segment occurs when the judge questions the attorney on her blatant disregard for proper legal procedure. The judge employs speech-synchronized gestures in a poetic performance to insult the questioning attorney, a legal identity constructed in and through a multimodal mapping of denotational text to interactional function.

"Education, Special"	"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates that students with disabilities be provided the necessary special education and related services that will allow them the benefit of a free and appropriate public education. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are the product of a team planning process that facilitates the coordination of such services for all students with disabilities in public schools who receive special education services. The purpose of the current study was to examine the association of student IEP participation with academic achievement across time. Although research has indicated the potential value of student participation in IEP meetings in developing self-determination skills, the relationship between student participation in IEP meetings and academic achievement has yet to be empirically examined. This article provides evidence that supports a positive association between student IEP participation and academic outcomes for students with disabilities at the elementary school level."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in prevention of delirium after hip fracture. DESIGN: Systematic review and metaanalysis. SETTING: Ward based models on geriatrics wards and visiting team based models on orthopaedics wards were included. PARTICIPANTS: Four trials (three European, one U.S.; 973 participants) were identified. Two assessed ward-based, and two assessed team-based interventions. MEASUREMENTS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases; Clinicaltrials.gov; and the Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Reference lists from full-text articles were reviewed. Incidence of delirium was the primary outcome. Length of stay, delirium severity, institutionalization, long-term cognition and mortality were predefined secondary outcomes. Duration of delirium was included as a post hoc outcome. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in delirium overall (relative risk (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.94) in the intervention group. Post hoc subgroup analysis found this effect to be preserved in the team-based intervention group (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.98) but not the ward-based group. No significant effect was observed on any secondary outcome. CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in the incidence of delirium after hip fracture with CGA. This is in keeping with results of non-randomized controlled trials and trials in other populations. Team-based interventions appeared superior in contrast to the Ellis CGA paper, but it is likely that heterogeneity in interventions and population studied affected this."
Health Policy & Services	"The prices that insurers pay physicians ultimately affect beneficiaries' health insurance premiums. Using 2014 claims data from three major insurers, we analyzed the prices insurers paid in their Medicare Advantage (MA) and commercial plans for 20 physician services, in and out of network, and compared those prices with estimated amounts that Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) program would pay for the same service. MA prices paid by those insurers were close to Medicare FFS prices, varied minimally, and were similar in and out of network. In contrast, commercial prices paid by the same insurers were substantially higher than FFS, varied widely, and were up to three times higher out of network than in network. Those results suggest that insurers can use statutory limits on out-of-network charges in MA to negotiate lower in-network prices in those plans. In contrast, without those limits on out-of-network prices, in-network prices in commercial plans are much higher."
Anthropology	"This ethnographic research examines the home-oriented cosmopolitan identities of South Korean expatriate and non-expatriate parents in China through their strategies in choosing schools for their children. I illustrate expatriate parents' pursuit of local and national engagements regardless of their children's immersion in international education. Moreover, I describe the cosmopolitan outlook of non-expatriate parents regarding their children's exposure to local and national schooling tracks. 'Rooted cosmopolitanism' indicates that the parents' openness to cultural differences is home-oriented and grounded locally in the host society. Furthermore, their school choices, which mix local and national with international education in their children's life trajectory, are conceptualised as transversal politics. Rather than rootless elites, South Korean expatriates and non-expatriates in China should be regarded as ordinary foreigners."
International Relations	"The question of endings is simultaneously a question of beginnings: wondering if International Relations is at an end inevitably raises the puzzle of when and how it' began. This article argues that International Relations' origins bear striking resemblance to a wider movement in post-war American political studies that Ira Katznelson calls the political studies enlightenment.' This story of the field's beginnings and ends has become so misunderstood as to have almost disappeared from histories of the field and accounts of its theoretical orientations and alternatives. This historical forgetting represents one of the most debilitating errors of International Relations theory today, and overcoming it has significant implications for how we think about the past and future development of the field. In particular, it throws open not only our understanding of the place of realism in International Relations, but also our vision of liberalism. For the realism of the International Relations enlightenment did not seek to destroy liberalism as an intellectual and political project, but to save it. The core issue in the invention of International Relations theory' its historical origins as well as its end or goal in a substantive or normative sense was not the assertion of realism in opposition to liberalism: it was, in fact, the defence of a particular kind of liberalism."
Social Work	"This article describes the core features of outcome research and then explores issues confronting researchers who engage in outcome studies. Using an intervention research perspective, descriptive and explanatory methods are distinguished. Emphasis is placed on the counterfactual causal perspective, designing programs that fit culture and context, and developing nuanced explanations for program outcomes. Five emerging challenges are discussed: (a) adapting interventions to the contexts and cultures in which programs are to be implemented, (b) avoiding potentially false attributions of program failure due to differential implementation, (c) making causal inferences from observational data with propensity score analysis (PSA), (d) examining person-centered outcomes in program evaluation, and (e) adjusting for rater effects in longitudinal research."
Anthropology	"Special iron objects in the form of a narrow plate with a fan-shaped blade on one or both ends, but with a substantial variation in shape and size, have continually been excavated from ancient historical sites located in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. The frequency and abundance of their excavation imply that they must have played a crucial role in the initial shaping of the Korean iron industry. Little is known, however, of their intended purposes or the exact engineering processes applied in their production. Speculation suggests that they might have been used as currencies or intermediate materials for the making of finished products. This study examined the microstructures of three such iron objects from the Korean Three Kingdoms Period (ca. 300-600 AD). It was determined that they were made of low carbon iron generally containing a number of non-metallic inclusions, with hints of surface carburization particularly at the ends of the plates. These results reveal the likely presence of an iron technology based primarily on the bloomery technique as opposed to the Chinese style of iron-making based on cast iron technology, which was also in use in ancient Korea.

"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background Previous work has identified a relationship between income inequality and risk for obesity and heart attack. We investigated the relationship between state-level income inequality and physical activity among US adults. Methods We used Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) cross-sectional data from a population based and representative sample of n = 428 828 US adults. Multilevel models were used to determine the association between state-level income inequality and participation in physical activity and strengthening exercises in the previous month. Results In comparison to males, females were significantly more likely to report being physically inactive (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.11), and less likely to meet aerobic activity requirements (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.88, 0.93), meet strengthening activities (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.69, 0.74), and meet overall physical activity recommendations (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88, 0.94). Cross-level Gini x sex interactions indicated that income inequality was associated with increased odds for participating in no physical activity (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.12), decreased odds in participating in strengthening physical activity (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89, 0.96), aerobic activity (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93, 0.99), and in meeting overall physical activity recommendations (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.91, 0.95) among women only. Conclusions Future studies are needed to identify mechanisms in which income inequality leads to physical activity behavior among US women."
Education & Educational Research	"Students' knowledge about the criteria for an upcoming test is a crucial component of assessment quality. Grounded in self-determination theory, we investigated whether knowledge about the criteria for an upcoming test related to students' situational motivation and experienced anxiety during physical education (PE). We also examined whether these relations were: (a) mediated by need-based experiences; and (b) moderated by teachers' motivating style. Participants were 659 students (55.54% boys, 44.46% girls, mean age 14.72 years, standard deviation = 0.94) out of 40 classes from 32 schools taught by 39 different PE teachers. Analyses through multilevel structural equation modeling showed that students with more knowledge about the criteria for an upcoming test valued and enjoyed the lesson more (i.e. autonomous motivation), and felt less aloof (i.e. amotivation). Relations between knowledge about the criteria and students' situational motivation were mediated by experienced need satisfaction. Specifically, students who had more knowledge about the criteria for an upcoming test felt more in charge of their learning process (i.e. autonomy satisfaction), felt more effective in reaching their goals (i.e. competence satisfaction) and felt more connected to the teacher (i.e. relatedness satisfaction). Although relations between knowledge about the criteria and students' motivation were not moderated by teachers' motivating style, teachers' motivating style displayed independent relations with students' motivation. Implications for assessment quality and students' motivation in PE are discussed."

International Relations	"During the Trump administration, Sino-American relations have deteriorated to the point where the new consensus in the U.S. foreign policy establishment is that a new Cold War has begun between the U.S. and China. This article looks at the origins of the first Cold War for insight into how a second Cold War might be avoided. There is a danger of the Cold War turning hot because of power transition dynamics. This article also invokes the pre-1914 Anglo-German rivalry, and argues that if conflict is to be avoided, the U.S. must accommodate China""s rise by yielding hegemony in East Asia and meeting China""s status claim."
Sociology	"Prior research indicates an association between exposure to trauma (e.g., being victimized) and perpetration of crime, especially in the context of chronic victimization. This study examines the relationship between trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and history of arrest and incarceration among a representative sample of black Americans from the National Survey of American Life (N = 5,189). One-third had a history of arrest, and 18 percent had a history of incarceration. Frequency of trauma exposure was associated with involvement with the criminal justice system. Relative to never experiencing trauma, experiencing 4 traumas was associated with elevated odds of arrest (odds ratio [OR] = 4.03), being jailed (OR = 5.15), and being imprisoned (OR = 4.41), all p < .01. PTSD was also associated with likelihood of incarceration among those with a history of trauma (OR = 2.18, p < .01). Both trauma exposure and trauma-associated psychopathology are associated with increased likelihood of arrest and incarceration in adulthood among black Americans."
Urban Studies	"This research examines recent trends in suburbanization for non-Latino Whites, Blacks, and Asians, and Latinos of all races. The authors find some association between group-level acculturation and socioeconomic status and 2000 suburbanization rates; however, these associations are largely attenuated by controls for suburban housing supply and do not explain much of the variation in changes in suburbanization rates from 1970 to 2000. Suburban housing supply is strongly associated with 2000 levels of suburbanization, yet these effects are largely attenuated by controlling for the suburban share of employment and affordable housing. Finally, the authors find large effects of change in suburban housing supply on change in group suburbanization rates; however, these effects are much weaker for Blacks relative to the other groups."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Lowering energy (calorie) intake is essential in managing a healthy weight. One method of doing this is substituting sugar with low/no-calorie sweeteners. The safety of sweeteners has been debated, but little is known about how they are perceived by professionals responsible for weight management advice. We sought to explore dietitian perceptions of sweeteners and to identify the practical advice they provide about them. Methods: We collected data in France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal and the United Kingdom. We used face-to-face interviews and a novel online tool designed to engage people with online content in a way that approximates everyday processes of making sense of information. Results: We identified four approaches to sweeteners that dietitians took: (1) sweeteners should not be used, (2) they should be limited and used primarily as a transitional product, (3) sweetener use was decided by the client and (4) sweeteners should be recommended or at least allowed. Where dietitians are reticent to recommend sweeteners this is because they feel it is important for consumers to reduce their attachment to sweet tastes and of evidence linking the consumption of sweeteners to increased appetite. There is also uncertainty about the possible negative health effects of sweeteners. Conclusions: Dietitians' perceptions about sweeteners are uncertain, ambivalent and divergent, sometimes explicitly being linked to fears about adverse health effects. Clear and authoritative guidance is required on scientific evidence around sweeteners as well as the ways in which they can be used in dietetic practice."
Ethnic Studies	"This article explores Black teachers' representation of Nat Turner in textbooks published between 1890 and 1922. While conventional readings of Black teachers during Jim Crow present them to be staunch enforcers of the politics of respectability, their representations of Turner disrupt such readings and imply that the racial discourse deployed in their classrooms was more complicated than common narratives suggest. These schoolteachers represented Turner as both an insurrectionist and respectablecharacteristics deemed incongruent under traditional reading of the politics of respectability. Black teachers asserted the humanity of Turner to their students and presented him as an inspiring character, even if his violent revolt created dis-ease for White society. This case captures a central dilemma in the socio-historical fabric of Black lifenamely, the persistent tension between Black accomodationism and Black Nationalism. More pointedly, while little is known about what happened in the intimate settings of Black teachers' classrooms during the Jim Crow era, these examples present an opportunity to explore some of the socio-political dimensions of their pedagogy."
Political Science	"Since most social science research relies on multiple data sources, merging data sets is an essential part of researchers"" workflow. Unfortunately, a unique identifier that unambiguously links records is often unavailable, and data may contain missing and inaccurate information. These problems are severe especially when merging large-scale administrative records. We develop a fast and scalable algorithm to implement a canonical model of probabilistic record linkage that has many advantages over deterministic methods frequently used by social scientists. The proposed methodology efficiently handles millions of observations while accounting for missing data and measurement error, incorporating auxiliary information, and adjusting for uncertainty about merging in post-merge analyses. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in realistic scenarios. We also apply our methodology to merging campaign contribution records, survey data, and nationwide voter files. An open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology."
Rehabilitation	"Based on the increasing diversity of Swedish society, health professionals, like occupational therapists, find it challenging to provide culturally competent services to international clients. Consequently, cultural competence among professionals needs to be measured and improved using psychometrically tested instruments. This study examines the clinical relevance, construct validity, and reliability of the Swedish version of the Cultural Competence Assessment Instrument among Swedish occupational therapists. Material and Methods. A randomised sample of 312 Swedish occupational therapists answered a survey based on the Swedish version of the Cultural Competence Assessment Instrument with supplementary questions on the clinical relevance of the instrument. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the clinical relevance of the Swedish version of the Cultural Competence Assessment Instrument. Factor analyses, both exploratory and confirmatory, were run to examine the factor structure. Cronbach""s alpha was performed to assess the internal consistency of the instrument. Results. The participants reported that the 24 items had high clinical relevance. The validation yielded a three-factor model: openness and awareness, workplace support, and interaction skills. All three of these factors showed high loadings. Conclusions. The study results indicated positive clinical relevance and psychometric properties for the Swedish version of the Cultural Competence Assessment Instrument and strong support to be utilised in Sweden. The implications of this study are important given the rapid growth in migration over the last few decades. A self-rating instrument measuring cultural competence could support occupational therapists"" professional knowledge and development when they interact with international clients. As the tool was originally developed in English in the United States, the feedback from the Swedish version could potentially be useful for the instrument in modified form and for use by occupational therapists in English-speaking countries."
History Of Social Sciences	"Ancient Chinese cities were closely connected to extramural areas. Therefore, research on the construction of urban space in ancient China should not be restricted to the area within the city wall; rather it should extend to the surrounding areas. There has been plenty of research on the urban planning and design of Chang'an in Tang Dynasty (618-907), which is the capital of the most prosperous dynasty of ancient China. However, little research has paid attention to its spatial order at the regional scale. This article aims to solve this problem using the 'triple-evidence' method, i.e. based on the evidences from archaeology, literature and field survey. More specifically, it explores the main problems involved in regional spatial construction, reveals the general strategies for construction of the regional spatial order, and further analyses the planning and design approaches for different spatial scales. This paper reveals that 'Taking the High Ground' is the main method used in the construction of regional spatial order of Chang'an Area in Tang Dynasty, which reflects the dialectical whole of 'configurational force' and 'form' in the planning and design theories of ancient China."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Multiple studies of ovarian cancer and genital talc use have led only to consensus about possible carcinogenicity. Seeking greater clarity, we examined this association in 2,041 cases with epithelial ovarian cancer and 2,100 age- and-residence-matched controls. Methods: We defined genital talc use as regular application to the genital/rectal area directly, on sanitary napkins, tampons, or underwear. To estimate talc-years, we multiplied applications per year by years used. Unconditional logistic regression, Wald statistics, likelihood-ratio tests, and polytomous logistic regression were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), trends, effect-modification, and heterogeneity by ovarian cancer histologic subtype. Results: Overall, genital talc use was associated with an OR (95% CI) of 1.33 (1.16, 1.52), with a trend for increasing risk by talc-years. Women who used talc were more likely to be older, heavier, asthma sufferers, and regular analgesic usersnone of which was a confounder. Dose-responses were more apparent for premenopausal women, especially nonsmokers and those heavier or postmenopausal users of menopausal hormones (hormone therapy [HT]). Subtypes of ovarian cancer more likely to be associated with talc included invasive serous and endometrioid tumors and borderline serous and mucinous tumors. Premenopausal women and postmenopausal HT users with these subtypes who had accumulated >24 talc-years had ORs (95% CI) of 2.33 (1.32, 4.12) and 2.57 (1.51, 4.36), respectively. Conclusion: Risks for epithelial ovarian cancer from genital talc use vary by histologic subtype, menopausal status at diagnosis, HT use, weight, and smoking. These observations suggest that estrogen and/or prolactin may play a role via macrophage activity and inflammatory response to talc."
Public Administration	"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the late Aaron Wildavsky's pluralist cultural and political theory. Wildavsky, who is an icon in the policy literature of American public administration, has often been at odds with the rational/linear paradigm that dominated the held of public policy. His work, Which has found a new home in complexity theory, spans several disciplines. Yet, the greatest value of Wildavsky's early systems thinking, including his theory of radical incrementalism, may be that it provides both a theoretical base and ethical reasoning with which to meaningfully discuss the possibilities of complexity theory as a new paradigm for governing."
Cultural Studies	"Examining career guides, this essay seeks to understand how the notion of passionate work is presently framed as an injunction, a commonsensical good thing we should aspire to find. How does the discourse of passion respond to labor conditions after the crisis, and what are among the possibilities it forecloses? This essay contains three overtures. First, I analyze how career guides change the pain of job loss to a space of empowerment. Directing readers to the optimistic proposal that their work can be better, career guides advise that the negative effect of the present needs only to be endured by the private individual so that a better future can be produced. Second, I consider what meanings passion produced by the instruments of career guides have, thinking about its relationship to neoliberal subjectivity. Last, I examine career guides that provide a counter-discourse of passion, looking into the values it cultivates in readers."
Cultural Studies	"As a contribution to current debates on the social life of methods', in this article we present an ethnomethodological study of the role of understanding within statistical practice. After reviewing the empirical turn in the methods literature and the challenges to the qualitative-quantitative divide it has given rise to, we argue such case studies are relevant because they enable us to see different ways in which methods', here quantitative methods, come to have a social life - by embodying and exhibiting understanding they make the social structures of everyday activities observable' (Garfinkel, 1967: 75), thereby putting society on display. Exhibited understandings rest on distinctive lines of practical social and cultural inquiry - ethnographic forays' into the worlds of the producers and users of statistics - which are central to good statistical work but are not themselves quantitative. In highlighting these non-statistical forms of social and cultural inquiry at work in statistical practice, our case study is an addition to understandings of statistics and usefully points to ways in which studies of the social life of methods might be further developed from here."

The research is based on fieldwork among youth activists in Moscow and St Petersburg. The author analyses how activist identity is classed and gendered, as well as its relations to the Russian civic field. The article suggests, first, that the activist identity is marked by an affiliation with the intelligentsia: activists have grown up in intelligentsia families and articulate their activities through the intelligentsia's 'markers', such as intelligence, discussion skills and education. Secondly, activists follow a dissidents' cultural model, by emphasizing the importance of non-conformism and traditional dissident values, and draw parallels between the contemporary government and the totalitarian Soviet state. Thirdly, this traditional intellectual dissident identity is associated with cosmopolitanism through the movement's international connections and appropriation of the forms of action of global social movements. Sometimes the activist practices and aspirations conflict with the group's ideals. Furthermore, the activist identity is gendered and embodied in the right activist 'look', which is defined by masculinity. Regardless of the movement's liberal ideals in regards to democracy, questions of gender and sexuality are not discussed, and activists do not question traditional understandings of gendered divisions of labour."
Rehabilitation	"The PEDI-CAT is a new computer adaptive test (CAT) version of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Additional PEDI-CAT items specific to postacute pediatric hospital care were recently developed using expert reviews and cognitive interviewing techniques. Expert reviews established face and construct validity, providing positive feedback on domain content and response scale options. Cognitive interviews established content validity while 60% of items were revised or removed because of the items being unclear or ambiguous, not measuring what was intended or lack of therapeutic terminology. As a result, an item bank containing more than 110 items in the three domains of self-care, mobility, and social function has been constructed and is ready to be calibrated and tested in a CAT application. With the addition of items specific for an inpatient pediatric postacute hospital setting, the PEDI-CAT (postacute hospital) will provide clinicians with the opportunity to use a context-specific assessment of function to support quality evaluations during inpatient rehabilitation care."
"Business, Finance"	"We investigate how nonfinancial performance measures (NPMs) can be used to encourage cooperation across divisions. The implementation of a project often requires joint efforts by multiple divisions. However, privately informed division managers sometimes find it in their self-interest to forgo profitable joint projects or to underinvest in relationship-specific assets. By treating the implementation of a joint project (e.g., a major process improvement or new product development) as an NPM, we show that paying the division managers discrete bonuses tied to this NPM improves the efficiency of project implementation and upfront investments. We derive how the optimal implementation bonus trades off distortions in ex post implementation and ex ante investments. In a dynamic version of the base model with learning-by-doing, we show that conditional on a project being implemented early on, the implementation bonus in subsequent periods will be higher than if the earlier project had not been Implemented."
Rehabilitation	"Background. The ability of the earth to sustain health among humans and in the natural world is under threat from overpopulation, environmental degradation, and climate change. These global threats are anticipated to harm health and human occupation in many direct and indirect ways. Strategies are needed to mitigate the effects of these threats and to build individual and community capacities to foster resilience. Purpose. This paper links issues of sustainability with occupational therapy philosophy and discusses how employing a sustainability lens with professional reasoning can help practitioners integrate sustainability into their practice. Key Issues. Human occupation is inseparable from the environments in which people live. Human occupation has caused the current environmental crisis, and targeted human action is required to safeguard future health and well-being. Implications. Occupational therapists have an ethical obligation to use professional reasoning strategies that, taken collectively, can help to build a sustainable and resilient future."
Demography	"Criminal behavior is a matter of concern to different stakeholders. The need to respond appropriately to their attention has led to the development of different variables involved in the phenomenon from different perspectives. The aim of this paper is to present two methodologies that are complementary rather than opposed to understanding one of the most mentioned variables in these studies, which is the parental relationships of a group of 133 inmates in the prison system of Jalisco. First quantitative test is performed through survival analysis of age of onset in criminal and who has brought the members of the sample behavior. The results show that respondents who were not raised by both parents, have a foray into criminal behavior at an earlier age. Subsequently there has been an analysis of life stories, where the resulting categories that refer to parenting by one parent figure are obtained through a crosstab for your understanding."
History Of Social Sciences	"This paper examines historical and contemporary processes of urban (re-)development and displacement in Uganda. Particular focus concerns the often conflicting strategies employed by urban managers and residents to plan, govern and live in both the late-colonial and early twenty-first century city. Both eras can be considered significant, even momentous, for the prominence of strategic projects of socio-spatial urban reconfiguration that incorporate(d) powerful discourses fusing land and housing development with societal progress and national development. The former project putatively centred on orchestrating African development and welfare, the latter on the more ambiguous project of re-development. The 'Good City' and the 'Good Citizen' are used as heuristic devices to examine the planning ideals and rationalities that inform(ed) these projects and the conflict of rationalities they provoke(d), particularly in terms of competing visions of the good city and good citizen. The paper emphasizes that current projects of redevelopmentalism do not take place in politically inert or historically benign space. Rather, it is shown how historical and place-based specificities articulate with and mediate the process of redevelopmentalism in Kampala and Jinja."
Linguistics	"This article deals with the position and the identification of Focus constituents in Latin, a 'free' constituent language known only through written texts. Three instances are analysed: entities that are newly introduced into the discourse, and obligatory arguments of the verbs ""to leave"" (proficiscor) and ""to send"" (mitto) in classical Latin prose (Caesar, Civil war and Sallust, The Iugurthine War) in order to observe whether constituents are positioned according to the principle of 'communicative dynamism' as described by Firbas (1992) and claimed for Latin by Panhuis (1982). Latin examples are compared with their translations into Czech, a modern 'free' constituent order Slavic language obeying the above-mentioned principle. The confrontation reveals several differences between Latin and Czech concerning not only the position of Focus constituents but also their anaphoric continuation and the position of anaphoric pronouns in the sentence.

Industrial Relations & Labor	"One of the key factors in the success of labour federations is to have affiliate unions who actively participate and support their work. This article examines the catalysts behind union involvement with central labour bodies and presents an analysis of the organizational motivations for engagement. The article uses comparative case study analysis to examine affiliate union commitment in the United States to the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations' state federations, area labour federations and central labour councils. Union leadership, along with contextual, interpretative and organizational factors, was found to influence the level of affiliate union involvement in central labour bodies."
Women'S Studies	"This article examines how gay men engage with masculine respectability in urban Turkey. Our analysis of twenty-four in-depth interviews in Ankara shows that gay men's self-presentation generally conforms to the expectations of masculine appearance and behavior in their class-based social circles. Thus we argue that social class and habitus are important for the norms of masculine respectability with a marked difference between lower-class/traditional middle-class and professional middle-class milieus. While family-dependent gay men in the lower class and traditional middle class often conform to hegemonic masculinity through their ""family guy"" performances and limit their sexual desires, professional middle-class gay men mobilize their social, economic, and cultural capital to carve out a gay life where they can perform a ""sophisticated"" gay identity and participate in a gay community, albeit in certain permitted domains."
Transportation	"This paper uses a structured literature review approach to investigate how seaports have been studied during the last three decades (1980s-2000s), and to provide a detailed analysis of seaport-related research during this period. To this end, 840 academic papers of relevance were identified. This paper develops a structured analysis of the relevant literature with general trends and research sub-themes being analysed on a decadal basis. In addition, consideration is given as to how the identified trends and research themes have reflected the evolution of seaports. It is shown that the scale of research related to seaports increased substantially during the 2000s, and that seaport research has become a dominant theme in the area of maritime economic studies. It is also clear that there has been a diversification of research with several new themes emerging, reflecting the evolution of the port industry such as the changing role of seaports in supply chains and logistics."
Public Administration	"Much intellectual effort is dedicated to examining the relationship between citizens and their government. In theory, for example, it is presumed that if government officials and citizens work collaboratively to determine and prioritize community needs, then public policies and government actions are likely to reflect the contributions and wishes of the public. As a result of such interactions and collaborative action, communities are assumed to have the capacity to engage their government to articulate concerns and solve problems. Examining these assumptions, this exploratory case study focuses on post-Katrina New Orleans to determine if rebuilding strategies that made the effort to include citizens in the process have increased community capacity. The authors consult key community organizers and the directors of leading nonprofit organizations to speak on behalf of citizens. Capitalizing on the hands-on experiences of organizational leaders and community organizers, in-depth interviewing is used to learn more about these efforts and to understand the nonprofit-government relationship and its contribution to building community capacity. Case study results are discussed in relation to the assumptions of Cuthill and Fein's theory of local governance and community capacity building. The authors conclude with a discussion of the research implications and areas in need of further examination."
Family Studies	"New reproductive technologies have allowed for a disruption of traditional kinship networks through the broadening of who is considered related. In this article, I explore Danish sperm donors"" accounts of relatedness and how they situate themselves within the networks that are formed - or have the potential to be formed - through donor insemination. This includes the ways in which they imagine their (potential) offspring and the recipients of their sperm, as well as negotiations with their romantic partners and other family members. The donors drew on narratives of ""the knock on the door"" and pop-cultural representations of (donor) fatherhood to understand their position and to frame relationships in particular ways. Donors regularly decoupled the social and the biological in their accounts while at the same time placing genetic relationships firmly at the centre of them."
History Of Social Sciences	"Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) is remembered for his claims that behavior results from a large number of independent mental faculties, and that these faculties are associated with cortical organs. Apart from the 26 faculties he localized in the cerebrum, he also recognized one faculty (reproductive drive) in the cerebellum. This picture, however, is based on Gall's presentations in his well-known later works, his four volume Anatomie et Physiologie. These books reflect the outcomes of Gall's thinking. They were steered by the observations and feedback he received in Vienna and while presenting his theories in the German states and neighboring countries between 1805 and 1807. Examining his lists before what he published in Paris shows how his faculties were changing. Notably, and as shown here, he had previously included several faculties associated with brainstem structures, in addition to the cerebellum, which he would continue to associate with some reproductive behaviors."
History Of Social Sciences	"The post-war reconstruction years of the 1940s and 1950s are generally referred to as the breakthrough of modernism in urban planning. The Netherlands in particular stands out internationally as a country, which transformed itself with plans and buildings conceived within the vanguard of a modernist vision. Examining the redevelopment of the Dutch city of Eindhoven, this paper suggests, however, that an alternative development of reconstruction planning emerged that ran parallel to the modernist planning project; one that displaced the authority and austerity measures of planned modernism. This development was very much influenced by the 'pillarization' of Dutch society, and the resulting tension between Catholic and Socialist parties, which had different ideas on town planning. By analysing the discourse of the 'big city' advisory committee, set up in the early 1950s by the North-Brabant regional authority to advise on the urban development of Eindhoven, this paper exposes the contested appropriation and use of modernist planning ideals and principles. Although the historiography on Dutch urban planning has minimized religion's role and presence in post-war reconstruction planning, it is being argued in this paper that it was an important theme, especially in areas like the predominantly Catholic province of Brabant."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This brief and polemical paper suggests that one crucial but under-investigated generator of health inequalities in Britain is the strategic decision-making of the wealthy and powerful. It is argued that the post-1970s dynamic between class and state which underpins this decision-making has been largely ignored by medical sociology in favour of repeated studies of the poor and powerless. Two case studies concerning (1) the pensions crisis, and (2) the global financial crisis, and their ramifications for health inequalities, are considered in some detail. A case is made that medical sociology neglects its critical and public obligations at its own peril. Social Theory & Health (2009) 7, 117-128. doi: 10.1057/sth.2009.5"
Family Studies	"A cross-sectional design based on social cognitive theory was used to examine the association between mother and daughter perceptions of parental indulgence and family health discussions as they influenced eating motivations, health outcomes, and life satisfaction of college females. Results indicated that daughters perceived greater overall indulgence and overnurturance than mothers. Indulgence had both positive and negative associations with daughters' life satisfaction. Daughters' perceptions of parental overnurturance and giving too much had the greatest total effects on life satisfaction. Even as daughters began to transition away from their parents, mothers still played an integral role in their health behaviors and outcomes. Additional research was recommended, along with practice recommendations for family and health professionals."
Business	"Can an information technology (IT) infrastructure contribute to competitive advantage and firm performance, even if this infrastructure follows IT standards and best practices, and is then neither rare nor inimitable as a resource? This study leverages the dynamic capability view and the underpinning evolutionary theories of routines, learning, and cooperation to develop a model analyzing and explaining the bottom-up path from the quality of IT infrastructure to the competitive excellence of the firm in medium-to-fast-paced business environments. This three-step causal path links the following constructs: (1) IT infrastructure quality (ITIQ); (2) business-IT partnership (BITP); (3) strategic contribution of IT (ITSC), and (4) firm's competitive excellence (CE). The study tests this model through a survey questionnaire to 212 Italian managers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Transportation	"Currently, many initiatives are under implementation in the Netherlands to integrate the stages of policymaking, plan development, construction, and operations and maintenance in the lifecycle of the infrastructure planning process by more explicitly involving business organizations. However, generally speaking, these integration initiatives stand alone and only connect a maximum of two stages at a time. In this article we explore whether and how contemporary lifecycle integration initiatives could be combined into a more integrated approach to be better able to address infrastructure planning complexities. We provide a framework for dealing with project complexity that distinguishes internal complexity, defined as the interrelatedness between project components, and external complexity, defined as the interaction of the project with its context. After assessing public and private experiences in combining single integration initiatives in complex settings by means of two focus group discussions, we conclude that current initiatives that connect stages in the planning process are suitable for addressing internal complexity. However, external complexity proves to be more difficult to adequately tackle when combining these lifecycle integration initiatives. We therefore recommend applying a more dynamic process management approach that stimulates continuous public-private interaction throughout the stages of the planning lifecycle. This could be facilitated by introducing alliances and cross-functional public-private teams."
Law	"Today, no one seriously challenges the descriptive premise that presidential preferences influence the decisions of administrative agencies. But this view of agency decisionmaking departs significantly from historical views. As the administrative state expanded in the early twentieth century, its proponents viewed agencies as bureaucratic experts capable of applying technical and scientific knowledge to pressing social problems. The expertise model of agency decisionmaking continues to inform contemporary judicial doctrine, even as some legal scholars have embraced the presidential-control model. This Article contributes to the debate regarding these two models of agency decisionmaking - analyzing- the potential effects of each model on agencies' evaluation of scientific knowledge and judicial review' of agency reasoning regarding science. The Article begins with an overview of the history of the reason-giving requirement in judicial doctrine and a discussion of the role of ""rationality"" in reason giving. Both the expertise and the presidential-control models attempt to draw lines between rational (expert) judgment and political reasons. Line drawing is a futile exercise given the contingent nature scientific knowledge, the value judgments inherent in policy science, and the post-positivist critique of knowledge generally. In addition, when agencies are subject to strong presidential control, they are likely to engage in ""motivated reasoning"" toward political ends. The Article concludes by proposing an approach to judicial review that recognizes the reality of agencies' motivated reasoning about scientific knowledge, as well as the impossibility of drawing lines between scientific rationality and presidential preferences. By identifting the ""danger signals"" associated with motivated reasoning, judicial review can ensure that an agency's role as presidential policymaker does not interfere with the agency's statutory responsibilities to use expert judgment. Contrary to what some scholars have argued, when an agency is acting pursuant to a presidential directive, its decisions require more, not less, scrutiny."
Economics	"In front of the current global financial crisis, the future existence of the firms is uncertain. The characteristics and the dynamics of the current world and the interdependences between the financial and economic markets around it demand a continuous research for new methods of bankruptcy prediction. The purpose of this article is to present a fuzzy logic-based system that predicts bankruptcy for one, two and three years before the possible failure of companies. The proposed fuzzy model uses as inputs financial ratios, that is dynamics of the financial ratios. In order to design and to implement the model, authors have used financial statements of 132 stock equity companies (25 bankrupt and 107 nonbankrupt). The paper presents also the testing and validation of the created fuzzy logic models."
Political Science	"This paper raises the question of the 'existence' (the ontological status) of the nation and other 'collective identities' in connection with issues of community and violence. It is widely recognised that 'the nation' must be understood as a social construct rather than a naturally or essentially 'given' entity; but this recognition is not enough if we then simply continue to think of the nation as an entity outside ongoing processes of construction and deconstruction. The details of the way each political entity is constructed are important. We examine two key documents and draw out two ways in which community (and thus democracy) can be constructed. An examination of the kind of 'national identity' projected in the Proclamation of 1916 illustrates the process of denomination that posits closed collective 'communities of identity' which reduce to friend-enemy, inside-outside binaries, thus setting the scene for conflict. Elements of the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement show we can extrapolate ways of creating a 'we' that does not reduce to one or another positive identity but that takes place when different people combine in the space opened by a commitment to non-violence and democracy in a 'community of others'."
"Education, Special"	"Tablet devices, as assistive and instructional technologies, can be highly effectual pedagogical tools with multifaceted benefits, such as the ability to integrate multimedia and the ability to track student progress over time. The unique value of particular assistive and instructional technologies explains, in part, why they are more widely used to teach struggling learners, as well as learners in general who demonstrate a spectrum of strengths and weaknesses. Given the centrality of reading and the cultivation of attendant skills as a prerequisite for learning all subjects, assessing the quality of literacy-based applications for tablet use is important. No such evaluative tool currently exists, necessitating the creation of a systematic tool, for use by both parents and educators, to select appropriate applications for their children or students who are struggling readers. To address this need, this article distills the effective instructional components for reading and provides a comprehensive rubric for reading applications. Suggestions from practitioners informed this process and were also implemented to enhance the usability of the rubric for educational reading applications. Descriptions of each rubric item and examples based on the sample reading application are provided."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: The aims of this study were to assess organizational readiness for e-health among the staff of an out-patient rehabilitation centre and to identify the personal characteristics of potential users that may have influenced readiness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 137 clinicians, 28 managers, and 47 nonclinical staff in a rehabilitation centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. All participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing organizational readiness for e-health. The measure contained three subscales: Individual, Organizational and Technological. Data were also collected on the users' profile, use of technologies and typical response to new information. Results: Generally, participants considered themselves ready to adopt e-health in their work (X = 73.8%, SD = 8.5) and they also had a favorable view of the technologies in place (X 73.8%, SD = 7.2). However, they perceived the center as being only moderately ready (X 66.6%, SD = 9.8) for e-health changes. Perceived workload and position/duties in the organization were found to have an impact on readiness for e-health. Conclusions: These results underscore the importance of addressing organizational readiness for change as a multidimensional concept. Based on these results, implementation strategies tailored to the specific profile of a rehabilitation organization were identified."
Substance Abuse	"Background and Objectives: Extended-release (XR) injection naltrexone has proved promising in the treatment of opioid dependence. Induction onto naltrexone is often accomplished with a procedure known as rapid naltrexone induction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pre-treatment patient characteristics as predictors of successful completion of a rapid naltrexone induction procedure prior to XR naltrexone treatment. Methods: A chart review of 150 consecutive research participants (N = 84 completers and N = 66 non-completers) undergoing a rapid naltrexone induction with the buprenorphone-clonidine procedure were compared on a number of baseline demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors. Logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics that may predict successful initiation of naltrexone after a rapid induction-detoxification. Results: Patients who failed to successfully initiate naltrexone were younger (AOR: 1.040, CI: 1.006, 1.075), and using 10 or more bags of heroin (or equivalent) per day (AOR: 0.881, CI: 0.820, 0.946). Drug use other than opioids was also predictive of failure to initiate naltrexone in simple bivariate analyses, but was no longer significant when controlling for age and opioid use level. Conclusions: Younger age, and indicators of greater substance dependence severity (more current opioid use, other substance use) predict difficulty completing a rapid naltrexone induction procedure. Such patients might require a longer period of stabilization and/or more gradual detoxification prior to initiating naltrexone. Scientific Significance: Our study findings identify specific characteristics of patients who responded positively to rapid naltrexone induction."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: A substantial literature has established the role of the inner organizational setting on the implementation of evidence-based practices in community contexts, but very little of this research has been extended to the education sector, one of the most common settings for the delivery of mental and behavioral health services to children and adolescents. The current study examined the factor structure, psychometric properties, and interrelations of an adapted set of pragmatic organizational instruments measuring key aspects of the organizational implementation context in schools: (1) strategic implementation leadership, (2) strategic implementation climate, and (3) implementation citizenship behavior. Method: The Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS), Implementation Climate Scale (ICS), and Implementation Citizenship Behavior Scale (ICBS) were adapted by a research team that included the original scale authors and experts in the implementation of evidence-based practices in schools. These instruments were then administered to a geographically representative sample (n = 196) of school-based mental/ behavioral health consultants to assess the reliability and structural validity via a series of confirmatory factor analyses. Results: Overall, the original factor structures for the ILS, ICS, and ICBS were confirmed in the current sample. The one exception was poor functioning of the Rewards subscale of the ICS, which was removed in the final ICS model. Correlations among the revised measures, evaluated as part of an overarching model of the organizational implementation context, indicated both unique and shared variance. Conclusions: The current analyses suggest strong applicability of the revised instruments to implementation of evidencebased mental and behavioral practices in the education sector. The one poorly functioning subscale (Rewards on the ICS) was attributed to typical educational policies that do not allow for individual financial incentives to personnel. Potential directions for future expansion, revision, and application of the instruments in schools are discussed."
History	"Proper observance of the Sabbath was an important aspect of Christian piety in the early modern Dutch Reformed Church. As evidenced by local church records in the Dutch city of Kampen, known as consistory records, church authorities sought to enforce better Sunday observance. This article notes the consistory's disgust with a disorderly Sabbath that was publicly desecrated. In particular, these concerns for proper Sabbath observance are tied to a concern for order and to the desire to establish a Reformed identity."
Law	"The present document resulted from an expert process initiated and conducted by the ICRC from 2003 to 2008. Dr. Nils Melzer, Legal Adviser at the ICRC, who has been responsible for the expert process since 2004, is the author of the Interpretive Guidance and most background documents and expert meeting reports produced during the process. The ICRC would like to express its gratitude to the experts, all of whom participated in the process in their personal capacity."
Demography	"Thomas Schelling proposed a simple spatial model to illustrate how, even with relatively mild assumptions on each individual's nearest neighbor preferences, an integrated city would likely unravel to a segregated city, even if all individuals prefer integration. This agent based lattice model has become quite influential amongst social scientists, demographers, and economists. Aggregation relates to individuals coming together to form groups and Schelling equated global aggregation with segregation. Many authors assumed that the segregation which Schelling observed in simulations on very small cities persists for larger, realistic sized cities. We describe how different measures can be used to quantify the segregation and unlock its dependence on city size, disparate neighbor comfortability threshold, and population density. We develop highly efficient simulation algorithms and quantify aggregation in large cities based on thousands of trials. We identify distinct scales of global aggregation. In particular, we show that for the values of disparate neighbor comfortability threshold used by Schelling, the striking global aggregation Schelling observed is strictly a small city phenomenon. We also discover several scaling laws for the aggregation measures. Along the way we prove that in the Schelling model, in the process of evolution, the total perimeter of the interface between the different agents always decreases, which provides a useful analytical tool to study the evolution."
Nursing	"Background: Increasingly within healthcare, different kind of ""centeredness"" are used to denote the focus of care which can create confusion for practitioners. Methods: A concept analysis was undertaken to identify the antecedents, attributes and relationship between family-, person-, and child-centered care. PubMed and CINAHL were searched from 2012 to 2017 and thirtyfive papers were reviewed. Results: Both person- and child-centered care are focused on individuals, a symmetric relationship and the tailoring of care to individual needs while family-centered care is focused on the family as a unit of which the child is included. Person-centered care focuses on an adult person with autonomy, while the focus in child-centered care is the individual child as an own actor with rights but still close to a family. Conclusion: It appears at a conceptual level that the concepts of centeredness contain both similarities and differences. Finding ways to structure nursing and focus the care that respects a person""s dignity and humanity is essential in healthcare and should be a major goal of health policy and health systems worldwide.

Ethics	"According to action-relative accounts of harming, an action harms someone only if it makes her worse off in some respect than she would have been, had the action not been performed. Action-relative accounts can be contrasted with effect-relative accounts, which hold that an action may harm an individual in virtue of its effects on that individual, regardless of whether the individual would have been better off in the absence of the action. In this paper, I argue that our judgments about the strength of the reason against harming lend support to effect-relative accounts over action-relative accounts. I first criticize Fiona Woollard's argument for the claim that an effect-relative account of harming could ground only a weak reason against harming. I then argue for a set of three principles that can be conjoined with an effect-relative account to explain the strength of the reason against harming."
Economics	"This article quantifies the productivity gain from CIMMYT-released semidwarf bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars over time, using test plot data from Mexico's Yaqui Valley. Previous studies have shown a deceleration in irrigated wheat yield growth since the 1980s, which could be due to slowing increase in genetic potential. Our results suggest that CIMMYT cultivars contributed a 0.46% annual increase (about 38 kg/ha annually) to wheat yields in the Yaqui Valley, which raised local wheat producers' revenue by an average of $4 million annually for the period 1990 to 2002, and by approximately $9 million in 2002."
Social Issues	"This article discusses the current threats to a free media in South Africa from a media historiographical point of view and argues that the role of a free media in South Africa is more important than ever Media freedom as a concept is discussed, and a free media sector is discussed from a libertarian as well as the social responsibility theoretical point of departure. Although these two models can be regarded as almost prehistoric amidst a plethora of current, more abstract, media theories, these models encapsulate the role of the media within a functioning democracy. This is followed by a brief discussion of the case study as research design and the historical method as research tool, also referring to the fact that the historical method supports the view of the cyclical nature of history since antiquity; this entails that events occur in a cycle and that only names and dates may differ, but what has happened before will occur again. The importance of media freedom as ""guardian and guide of all other liberties"" is discussed, concluding that no single definition of media freedom can exist, as it is interpreted according to various relevant contexts. As such, no absolute freedom exists either, as it is always relative to and measured against other liberties and rights, as also illustrated by media freedom as enshrined in Article 16 in the South African Constitution's Bill of Rights. This discussion is followed by two case studies in the struggle for media freedom against the government of the day over a time span of almost two hundred years in South Africa. The first is under authoritarian British colonial rule, and the second under a democratic dispensation under the ANC. In the first, at the beginning of the 1800s, the situation developed from no freedom of the press to so-called unconditional freedom. The press pioneers Fairbairn, Pringle and Greig secured press freedom for the time by standing up against a colonial governor who has been described as a despot and as authoritarian. They succeeded in obtaining freedom of the press in what was known as the Magna Carta of press freedom, namely Ordinance 60 of the Cape of Good Hope in 1829. It was regarded as a new era for the free press in South Africa, where it would be impossible to interfere with the press ever again. As context, examples of interference by the government of the day are discussed briefly to lead to the second case study, which is set in post-1994 South Africa. Despite constitutional guarantees, the proposed Media Appeals Tribunal (MAT), the Protection of State Information Bill (commonly referred to as the Secrecy Bill), the amendments to the Films and Publication Board (FPB) and the February 2015 jamming of cell phone signals in parliament, as well as undemocratic statements and actions by South Africa's head of state and his Government, suggest serious dangers to media freedom. Experts are united on the issue that these aspects contain serious threats to media freedom. Within a democratic dispensation and because of the media's function within the libertarian/social responsibility model, the system of self-regulation therefore is relevant and is discussed briefly. Such a self-regulation system in this case, the South African Press Council, the Press Code and the Press Ombud system is seen as vital for the functioning of an independent media sector Despite this on-going review of self-regulation, the threats of the MAT, the Secrecy Bill, seemingly ad hoc decisions by the State's security cluster, and the FPB and its amendments, as well as statements made by the South African president and his government, indicate that media freedom, despite its constitutional entrenchment, is not guaranteed. The article concludes that media freedom is always conditional, despite a pro tempore experience that it can be unconditional. Indeed, media freedom is as much an issue in a so-called liberal democratic dispensation as it was in a previous dictatorial colonial era."
"Education, Special"	"In South Korea, there is no consensus on the definition of emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). This column focuses on how the definition has affected the prevalence rates and services available for students with EBDs. Of the legal, clinical, and educational definitions, the legal definition of EBDs is currently in common use, which raises two issues: First, using this definition results in limitations in terms of interventions for and understanding of EBDs. Second, the definition represents a departure from how EBDs have been used to classify children and adolescents for the purposes of prevention. In short, it was found that administrative adjustments of the legal agents are required and that mutual cooperation is needed between service professionals and reformers. The role of each expert is stressed in the establishment of a concrete definition and service delivery system."
Law	"The judicial oversight of democracy has posed intractable problems for constitutional law. Nowhere is this challenge more evident than in the Supreme Court's ongoing attempts to develop a coherent approach to the adjudication of partisan gerrymandering claims. This Article therefore proposes a new framework-the antidomination model-which sheds fresh light on the judicial supervision of democracy I argue that a critical aspect of the problem, but one that is under-theorized and often overlooked, is that many of the pathologies that affect the democratic process are best conceptualized as instances of domination; that is, they have at their core an illegitimate exercise of public power The problem posed by the abuse of power, however, has not been directly addressed in a sustained way by courts and commentators. This Article therefore advances a normative and institutional theory of antidomination that would allow courts to minimize the illegitimate exercise of power by public officials in the design of democratic institutions, without also involving courts too deeply in determining what that design should be. Under the antidomination model, the principal role of the courts is to minimize domination and the appearance of domination in the processes through which democratic institutions are designed. The antidomination model offers a new approach for conceptualizing and resolving partisan gerrymandering claims."
Transportation	"Links between gender, activity/travel patterns and the life course have become a significant subject of inquiry in recent years. This paper draws upon a previous study that found that key events in the life course had significant effects on the complexity of trip and activity patterns. Some of these effects differed significantly between men and women. The panel data analysis presented here uses descriptive statistics to illustrate more clearly the patterns of time use before and after key events such as the birth of a child, entry into the labour market, or retirement. Further, regression models of time use changes for employed work, out-of-home leisure, escort, and time spent at home are presented. The data used is the German Mobility Panel (GMP) 1994 to 2014 in which households and their members are asked three times in three successive years to report the trips they made over a week. The results show the gendered effects of various key events on change in time use. Key events in partnership and the family affect women's time use more than men's, while for labour market events it is mostly the other way round."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Using two new data sets from France, the authors present die first study of the comparative productivity of labor-managed and conventional firms involving large representative samples of firms in a range of industries including services. Their study offers new stylized facts on labor-managed firms, and disentangles incentive effects from those of differences in input demand behavior on factor elasticities. Contrary to received wisdom, labor-managed firms are not smaller than conventional firms; they grow as fast or faster in all industries. The two groups of firms organize production differently. Labor-managed firms are as productive as conventional firms, or more productive, in all industries, and use their inputs efficiently; but in several industries conventional firms would produce more with their current input levels if they organized production like labor-managed firms. On average overall, firms would produce more using the labor-managed firms' industry-specific technologies. Labor-managed firms do not produce at inefficiently low scales."
Sociology	"Emotions are essential but little understood components of research; they catalyze and sustain creative scientific work and fuel the scientific and intellectual social movements (SIMs) that propel scientific change. Adopting a micro-sociological focus, we examine how emotions shape two intellectual processes central to all scientific work: conceiving creative ideas and managing skepticism. We illustrate these processes through a longitudinal study of the Resilience Alliance, a tightly networked coherent group collaborating at the center of a burgeoning scientific social movement in the environmental sciences. We show how emotions structured and were structured by the group's growth and development, and how socio-emotive processes facilitated the rapid production of highly creative science and helped overcome skepticism by outsiders. Hot spots and hot moments-that is, brief but intense periods of collaboration undertaken in remote and isolated settings-fueled the group's scientific performance and drove the SIM. Paradoxically, however, the same socio-emotive processes that ignited and sustained creative scientific research also made skepticism more likely to occur and more difficult to manage. Similarly, emotions and social bonding were essential for the group's growth and development, but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes."
International Relations	"This article reviews the recent Humanitarian Initiative in the nuclear disarmament movement and the associated non-proliferation and disarmament literature. It argues that rather than this initiative being a transformative moment in nuclear politics, as claimed by supporters, it instead fits into a long history of nuclear politics as the politics of rethinking the unthinkable' and, as such, is located not only within the long-established institutions of international society, as realist critics claim, but also within the long-established and limiting forms of speech of international society. The article questions the limitations of the dominant framing of nuclear weapons as unthinkable', and claims that focusing on the seemingly trivial matter of the prevalence of cliche in this discourse actually reveals a deeper problem of the limits of this approach. In doing so, the article shows how the problem of standardised, repetitive ways of speaking, reliance on nukespeak', and dominant tropes of nuclear speech identified in much of the literature is not that of the somehow innate unthinkability' of nuclear weapons, but that this unthinkability' and the associated unspeakability' of the nuclear are rhetorical frames that limit the possibility for political change."
Business	"The extent of the economic distance between a firm's home origin and its foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important strategic decision for the investing firm. This study fills an important knowledge gap by investigating the home institutional antecedents of FDI economic distance. Drawing insights from comparative institutionalism, we argue that home-country states vary in both their power to coordinate the economy and the external and internal channels through which they exercise that power. These variations have implications on a firm's motivation and capability to escape external dependencies on the home-country state by investing in economically distant foreign locations. Empirically, using a dataset of 891 new international entrants from 2004 to 2011, we found support for our hypotheses that home-country state power is positively associated with FDI economic distance, and that the influence of the home-country state is contingent on the state's governance quality and its ownership in firms.

"Education, Special"	"Letter-sound knowledge is a strong predictor of a student's ability to decode words. Approximately 50% of English words can be decoded by following a sound-symbol correspondence rule alone and an additional 36% are spelled with only one error. Many students with reading disabilities or who struggle to learn to read have difficulty with phonology, an understanding of how sounds are organized within language. This can result in difficulty grasping the alphabetic principle, the knowledge of the relation between speech sounds and the letters/letter patterns that represent them. Research has demonstrated the benefits of intensive, explicit instruction for developing struggling readers' capacity to identify phonemes and apply knowledge of phoneme-grapheme correspondence for decoding. In this article, common misconceptions and basic tenets of effective letter-sound instruction are provided to help special educators and reading interventionists plan for effective phoneme-grapheme correspondence instruction for students with reading disabilities or who are at risk for reading failure."
Nursing	"Theoretical Principles: Pragmatic Children""s Nursing Theory draws on the theory principles of North American Pragmatist including the work of William James, Richard Rorty, and John Dewy and incorporates Margaret Urban Walkers"" work on expressive collaborative feminism. Phenomena Addressed: In this discussion paper I explore howthe role of parents is framed in Pragmatic Children""s Nursing Theory. In setting out Pragmatic Children""s Nursing Theory I detailed a rebuttal of Family Centred care. However, working with the theory I have come to realise how the arguments against Family Centred care do not exclude involving parents in children""s care. Indeed, Pragmatic Children""s Nursing recognises the vital role parents and other carers play in children""s access and experience of childhood. UsingWalkers expressive collaborative feminism who accepts and who rejects the parenting role for children living with illness is discussed. Research Linkages: This is an emergent theoretical approach to children""s nursing with challenging research evidence. However, I draw on existing children""s nursing studies to explore the potential of Pragmatic Children""s Nursing Theory to assist children, parents and nurses in negotiating care. Concluding that as childhoods and parenting are continually evolving, in time, in certain physical, cultural and political contexts, that pragmatic theory will evolve to meet these intergenerational contextual challenges.

Rehabilitation	"Transitioning to adult life is a complex time for all young people and includes assuming adult roles in work, independent living, and social relationships. As young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) access a broader array of social settings in their transition, including higher education, work, and independent living situations, social issues take on greater importance. Maintaining age appropriate relationships, including sexual relationships, is a critical piece of inclusion. However, students with IDD are not afforded the same access to sexual health information offered to other students. This lack of information and opportunity for development leaves young adults with IDD unfamiliar with many aspects of human sexuality and social relationships and potentially unprepared to function in adult social settings. This article provides an overview of the scope and importance of sexual health knowledge for young adults with IDD, limitations in current educational practices, practices and resources for addressing sexual health knowledge for this population, and suggestions for ways that rehabilitation counselors can ensure attention to this area within the transition process without going beyond our scope of practice."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Since many educational researchers and program developers have limited knowledge of formative evaluation, formative data may be underutilized during the development and implementation of an educational program. The purpose of this article is to explain how participatory, responsive, educative, and qualitative approaches to formative evaluation can facilitate a partnership between evaluators and educational researchers and program managers to generate data useful to inform program implementation and improvement. This partnership is critical, we argue, because it enables an awareness of when to take appropriate action to ensure successful educational programs or ""kairos"". To illustrate, we use examples from our own evaluation work to highlight how formative evaluation may facilitate opportune moments to (1) define the substance and purpose of a program, (2) develop understanding and awareness of the cultural interpretations of program participants, and (3) show the relevance of stakeholder experiences to program goals.

Substance Abuse	"A detailed understanding of the effectiveness of interventions designed to meet drug using women offenders' (DUWOs) complex needs is essential to maximize success. This article reports on a narrative literature review of evaluations of interventions designed to assist DUWOs in their recovery from drug use and in their desistance from offending. It aims to identify gaps in that research and point to possible directions for future studies. It shows that successful interventions are likely to be intensive, of significant duration, multidimensional, and interdisciplinary. Evaluations must similarly be designed to take into account all individual and structural factors. Qualitative longitudinal research which incorporates DUWOs' opinions on their needs might best inform the development of interventions tailored to meeting those needs. Evaluation design should acknowledge the importance of progress as well as outcomes and be designed to follow DUWOs through their whole sentence rather than focusing on a single intervention/point in time without the context of what came before and what might or should happen in the future."
Information Science & Library Science	"This paper reports on the extent to which higher education institutions in the UK have set up central funds and similar institutionally co-ordinated approaches to the payment of open access article-processing charges. It presents data demonstrating that central funds have only been set up by a minority of institutions and that the number of institutions has not changed significantly between 2009 and 2011. It then explores the barriers to the establishment of such funds and discusses recent developments that might lower these barriers. Finally, it provides a case study of the development of the central fund at the University of Nottingham in the UK and considers the sustainability of such an approach.

"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background Racing games have emerged as top-selling products in the video and computer game industry. The effect of playing racing games on the inclination of gamers to take risks has been investigated. Method Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, the impact of personality traits on the effects of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination was examined. The Vienna Test System, which includes the Eysenck Personality Profile Test and the Vienna Risk-Taking Test, was used to measure risk-taking inclination and risk-taking while driving. Experiment 2 was designed and conducted to analyse the effects of different intensity levels of car racing games on risk-taking inclination, and to study the relationship between physiological data and risk-taking inclination. Physiological data on skin conductance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured with the NeuroDyne System. Results Participants playing a racing game were more inclined to take risks in critical road traffic situations than those playing a neutral game. The adventurousness dimension of the Eysenck Personality Profile Test correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. More importantly, the effect of the intensity level of a racing game on risk-taking inclination was significant. The higher the intensity level of the racing game, the higher the risk-taking inclination while driving. The effect of intensity level of the racing game on skin conductance was significantly positive. Skin conductance correlated significantly positively with risk-taking inclination. Conclusions The effect of playing racing games on risk-taking inclination is linked to personality and physiological data. Some recommendations are proposed as a result of this study for racing game management."
Anthropology	"The long-contested question of the Inuit occupation of the Quebec Lower North Shore has been illuminated by excavations at five 17th-18th-century sod-house villages. Few organic artifacts survive, and the preserved material culture is almost entirely of European artifacts or materials refashioned into Inuit forms. Faunal assemblages indicate winter occupations. Hare Harbor represents a departure from other settlements in having been an Inuit-Basque/French joint venture. Lower North Shore Inuit appear to have had a more positive relationship with Europeans than Labrador Inuit, but their presence was vigorously contested by Innu whose coastal lands they appropriated. Questions about year-round occupancy remain because few summer sites have been found. Was the Lower North Shore Inuit occupation a wave migration followed by long-term settlement and withdrawal a century later, or a series of episodic migrations followed by periodic or even seasonal withdrawal? Historical records document intermittent Innu hostilities ending with Inuit withdrawal by AD 1750. In the mid-19th century, Inuit returned, and today their genetic and cultural heritage is an important feature of Lower North Shore life."
History Of Social Sciences	"If his relationship to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis has been widely acknowledged, Claude Levi-Strauss' rapport with C.G. Jung's analytical psychology remains quite obscure. While secondary commentary has been abundant, its approach has above all been intertextual, to the detriment of a rigorously historical reading. Even if certain arguments put forward by supporters of so-called influence deserve to be taken into account, especially because they highlight Levi-Strauss ambiguities and paradoxes toward Jung, this paper provides proof that a precise reading of the texts, with the help of recent studies on the intellectual genesis of Levi-Strauss, lead to reject the thesis of an unstated debt owed by the French anthropologist to the Zurich psychologist."
Criminology & Penology	"Research on child neglect has found that neglected children are more likely to experience worse developmental outcomes than non-neglected children. These negative outcomes include antisocial behavior as well as poor school performance. Eco-developmental theory has found that adverse social contexts often worsen these outcomes for neglected and maltreated youths. However, little research has been done on the educational outcomes of neglected children and none of it has employed a national, longitudinal, community sample with an examination of social context. We do so in our research and find that several types of child neglect significantly predict a variety of poor educational outcomes at the bivariate level and that physical and educational neglect were significantly associated with a composite measure of school problems in multivariate analysis. We offer several explanations for our findings and future directions for research."
"Education, Special"	"Approximately 15% of New Zealand children will experience a traumatic brain injury during their school years. Given that educators play an important role in facilitating the successful school re-entry and recovery of these students, it is paramount that educators have adequate knowledge of childhood traumatic brain injury. This study used an online questionnaire to assess knowledge traumatic brain injury among 20 New Zealand educators. It also identified what services educators were aware of within their schools and communities that could assist with the management of students with brain injury, and what further training or information educators required to feel confident in supporting these students in the school environment. Results indicated that although educators possessed sound general understanding of traumatic brain injury, they had some misconceptions regarding the implications and recovery trajectories of these injuries during childhood. Educators reported the need for training relating to diagnostic criteria and strategies for supporting students with traumatic brain injury in the classroom. Providing educators with information and training on how to identify traumatic brain injury and manage the needs of students with traumatic brain injury will allow them to facilitate inclusive and supportive educational opportunities, leading to improved outcomes for these students."
International Relations	"We examine the influence of the Korean diaspora residing in the Russian Far East (Primorskiy province) in promoting a pan-Korean identity in Northeast Asia. In doing so, we utilize the insights offered by the constructivist school of international relations on the role of evolving identities and transnational communities for cooperation. We investigate the trajectory of the development of the Korean Russian diaspora in the context of the current troubled relationship between South and North Koreas. We offer policy-related recommendations for people-to-people diplomacy and cooperation in the Northeast Pacific region."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"The human papillomavirus (HPV) is clearly established as the cause of cervical cancer, and vaccines targeting oncogenic forms of the virus are important as a primary method of prevention. However, barriers to cervical screening and vaccination such as a lack of knowledge of HPV, access to healthcare, and poor follow-up prevent the acceptance and utilization of HPV vaccines. Strategies for prevention of disease and implementation of vaccination are in development, but the importance of primary prevention of HPV infection needs to be stressed. This review assesses the potential impact of vaccination for cervical cancer, barriers to vaccination, and the methods used to increase coverage. With the advent of prophylactic vaccines, HPV, a common infection in the United States, can be prevented in most women."
History	"This article analyzes the vision of daily press graphic humor regarding the last aperturist attempt of Franco's dictatorship, known as the Espiritu del 12 de febrero. To do this, the article analyzes strips published between February, 1974 and November, 1975 (date of the death of Francisco Franco) by the main Spanish newspapers of the time (Abc, El Alcazar, Informaciones, La Vanguardia, and Ya). The conclusion is that the reformist initiative was greeted with a generally skeptical attitude in political caricatures published in these newspapers."
Business	"This research proposes a framework for relating governance mechanisms (power, contracts, and trust) to the generation of creative approaches to business activities in buyer-seller relationships. The framework is tested with a survey of 262 purchasing agents. The results indicate that trust and contract affect the three facilitators of inter-organizational creativity: (1) knowledge-sharing routines (resources), (2) learning orientation (motivation), and (3) managerial support and open-mindedness (managerial practices). Also, the effects of trust and contract on the creativity in buyer-seller relationships are fully mediated by the above three facilitators. In particular, trust plays a more influential role in stimulating creativity. While power is not significantly associated with any of the facilitators, its overall effect on creativity is negative.

Demography	"Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008) (MR) argued that changing selection of working females on unobservable characteristics, from negative in the 1970s to positive in the 1990s, accounted for nearly the entire closing of the gender wage gap. We argue that their female wage equation estimates are inconsistent. Correcting this error substantially weakens the role of the rising selection bias (39 % versus 78 %) and strengthens the contribution of declining discrimination (42 % versus 7 %). Our findings resonate better with related literature. We also explain why our finding of positive selection in the 1970s provides additional support for MR's main hypothesis that an exogenous rise in the market value of unobservable characteristics contributed to the closing of the gender gap."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"During the 1960s, Howard M. Temin (1934-1994), dared to advocate a ""heretical"" hypothesis that appeared to be at variance with the central dogma of molecular biology, understood by many to imply that information transfer in nature occurred only from DNA to RNA. Temin's provirus hypothesis offered a simple explanation of both virus replication and viral-induced cancer and stated that Rous sarcoma virus, an RNA virus, is replicated via a DNA intermediate. Popular accounts of this scientific episode, written after the discovery of an RNA-directed DNA polymerase in 1970, tend to describe the reaction to his proposition as ardent opposition. Typically these accounts use a aEuro(1)molecular biology' standpoint emphasizing the central dogma's part in its rejection. In this article, however, this episode will be examined from a joint perspective of virology and experimental cancer research. From this perspective it is clear that Temin's work was well within the epistemological and methodological boundaries of virology and cancer research. Still, scientists did havea reasons pound to doubt the provirus hypothesis, but these do not seem to be good enough to either justify an account that portrays Temin as a renegade or his ideas as heretical."
Economics	"The paper investigates the respective impacts on incomes of contractual arrangements, direct sales and spot marketing for ""safe vegetable"" farmers in northern Vietnam. It is based on a survey of 137 peri-urban vegetable farmers that was analyzed using different econometric methods to correct selection biases. Direct sales and contractual arrangements have a significant positive impact on income compared to spot marketing. Contracts have less impact on income compared to direct sales. It is recommended that policies be formulated to stimulate direct dealings between farmers and consumers, which enhance consumer confidence in terms of quality and translate into higher farmer income than anonymous exchanges or contracts.

"Business, Finance"	"Using a sample of UK firms, we find that institutional block-holding is negatively associated with directors' ownership and is positively associated with board composition, suggesting that institutional block-holders regard directors' ownership and board composition as substitute and complementary control mechanisms, respectively. We also show that UK institutional block-holders prefer smaller firms and firms with a shorter listing history. The presence of institutional block-holders is associated with smaller boards and lower trading liquidity. Finally, our results indicate that the investment preference of UK institutional block-holders varies with the level of their shareholding."
Women'S Studies	"This article interrogates a psychoanalytically inflected strain of anti-social queer theory that in privileging refusal and negation, views as paradigmatic of queerness' the destructive, annihilative aspects in (queer) sex. In this view, sexuality is a product of the unconscious, thus irreducible to gender, such that gender is irrelevant to (and indeed hinders) understandings of desire. Informed by feminism, which views gender as crucial to any theory on sexuality, I expose that which sexual negation' masks through this very disavowal - that of gender and the body itself. I argue that subtending the figural representation of queer/ness is a deep-seated, albeit disguised, masculinism that, through negation, works to re-centre and re-virilise (gay) men's sexual economies. I take up Butler's lesbian phallus to de-idealise and thus challenge this privileging of the penis operating within this strain of queer - as only phallic sexual economies can, it seems, deliver the very annihilation we (all) seek."
Political Science	"Private information characteristics like resolve and audience costs are powerful influences over strategic international behavior, especially crisis bargaining. As a consequence, states face asymmetric information when interacting with one another and will presumably try to learn about each others' private characteristics by observing each others' behavior. A satisfying statistical treatment would account for the existence of asymmetric information and model the learning process. This study develops a formal and statistical framework for incomplete information games that we term the Bayesian Quantal Response Equilibrium Model (BQRE model). Our BQRE model offers three advantages over existing work: it directly incorporates asymmetric information into the statistical model's structure, estimates the influence of private information characteristics on behavior, and mimics the temporal learning process that we believe takes place in international politics."
Information Science & Library Science	"Valuable knowledge in every community is changed frequently. It often remains closely inside a community, even though it has huge potential to promote problem-solving in the wider community. Our research aims to increase the capability of communities in capturing, sharing and maintaining knowledge from any domain. We utilize an ontology, a shareable form, to collect, consolidate and find commonality inside knowledge. Most ontologies available these days were created by domain experts to fulfill certain domain requirements. However, in cases when domain experts are not obtainable or standard agreement within the domain is not available, such as in natural or herbal therapy domain, we propose that an ontology can also be extracted from existing knowledge-bases residing within the community. In order to achieve our aim, we design a data-driven dynamic ontology model. Our model consists of base knowledge creation and knowledge propagation phases. In the base knowledge creation phase, we define a general concept of capturing community knowledge from data into an ontology representation, rather than just transforming a specific data format into an ontology as found in existing studies. In our knowledge propagation phase, the dynamic community knowledge sources become the trigger of propagation. This is different from some approaches in existing studies, where the triggering event is an individual change inside the ontology and external data may not be the base source of the knowledge in the evolving ontology. We define the propagation feature with a novel delta script. The script is minimum yet complete to simplify and save knowledge sharing transportation resources. The evaluation result shows that the data-driven dynamic ontology with its propagation method not only delivers complete and correct semantics but also shows good performance in terms of operation cost and processing time."
Ethnic Studies	"McGeever's essay offers an analysis of the Bolshevik encounter with antisemitism in 1917. Antisemitism was the dominant modality of racialized Othering in late imperial Russia. Yet 1917 transformed Jewish life, setting in motion a sudden and intense period of emancipation. In Russian society more generally, the dramatic escalation of working-class mobilization resulted not only in the toppling of the Tsar in February, but the coming to power of the Bolsheviks just eight months later. Running alongside these revolutionary transformations, however, was the re-emergence of anti-Jewish violence and the returning spectre of pogroms. Russia in 1917, then, presents an excellent case study for exploring how a socialist movement responded to rising antisemitism in a moment of political crisis and escalating class conflict. His article does two things. First, it charts how the Bolsheviks understood antisemitism, and how they responded to it during Russia's year of revolution. In doing so, it finds that Bolsheviks participated in a wide-ranging set of campaigns organized by the socialist left, the hub of which was composed of the soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies. Second, the essay argues that antisemitism traversed the political divide in revolutionary Russia, finding traction across all social groups and political projects. As the political crisis deepened in the course of 1917, the Bolsheviks increasingly had to contend with the antisemitism within the movement. In traditional Marxist accounts, racism and radicalism are often framed in contestation. McGeever's article, however, offers a more complex picture in which antisemitism and revolutionary politics could be overlapping, as well as competing world views."
Substance Abuse	"The present study examined alexithymia, drinking motives and alcohol expectancies in a non-clinical sample of 100 young adults aged 18-30 years. Those with alexithymia scored higher on measures of coping motives for drinking and affective change expectancies than those without alexithymia. The findings suggest that people with alexithymia are more likely not only to drink to cope, but also to experience feelings of intensified negative mood after drinking, compared to people without alexithymia even when both groups show similar levels of drinking."
Education & Educational Research	"In this paper, a review of long-term retention of basic science knowledge is presented. First, it is argued that retention of this knowledge has been a long-standing problem in medical education. Next, three types of studies are described that are employed in the literature to investigate long-term retention of knowledge in general. Subsequently, first the results of retention studies in general education are presented, followed by those of studies of basic science knowledge in medical education. The results of the review, in the general educational domain as well as in medical education, suggest that approximately two-third to three-fourth of knowledge will be retained after one year, with a further decrease to slightly below fifty percent in the next year. Finally, some recommendations are made for instructional strategies in curricula to improve long term retention of the subject matter dealt with."
Social Issues	"The functional approach to volunteerism holds that outcomes from volunteering (e. g., satisfaction and intentions to remain a volunteer) are a function of the match between a volunteer's motivations and affordances to meet those motivations found in the environment (i.e., the volunteer activities, position, or organization). In this article, the authors introduce an index for calculating a volunteer's total number of matches across six motivational categories identified by past research. They demonstrate that this index predicts outcomes better than motives or affordances alone and as well as any univariate match index (i.e., in a particular motivational category). Following logic about strong and weak situational contexts, the authors demonstrate that the magnitude of the total matches effect may be greater when organizational contexts are less structured and smaller when contexts are more structured. They discuss theoretical and practical benefits of this total match index."
History	"In response to the OHR editors"" prompt regarding important considerations for teaching oral history during disasters and pandemics, this article presents a case study model for developing socially engaged and collaborative pedagogy that centers on the ethics of conducting oral history in the present moment of crisis and hiatus. Central to our oral history research and pedagogical concerns about teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic are inquiries such as, what conditions create an ethical time for recording history? How can we use oral histories about the pandemic to address the normalized conditions of precarity and instability that millions in the United States and around the world face on a daily basis? In addressing these concerns, we also gesture towards developing a participatory mode of history making that redresses historical erasure, misrepresentation, and underrepresentation."
Nursing	"Purpose: Critically ill patients are at risk for short and long termmorbidity. Early mobilization (EM) of critically ill adults is safe and feasible, with improvement in outcomes. There are limited studies evaluating EM in pediatric critical care patients. Provider beliefs and concerns must be evaluated prior to EM implementation in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Design and Methods: A survey was distributed to PICU providers assessing beliefs and concerns with regards to EM of PICU patients. Results: Seventy-one providers responded. Most staff believed EM would be beneficial. The largest perceived benefits were decreased length of both stay and mechanical ventilation. The largest perceived concerns were risk of both endotracheal tube and central venous catheter dislodgement. Surveyed clinicians felt significantly more comfortable mobilizing the oldest as compared to the youngest patients (p < 0.0001). Clinicians also felt significantly more comfortable mobilizing patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the oldest as compared to the youngest patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: There is clear benefit to the EM of adult ICU patients, with evidence supporting its safety and feasibility. As pediatric patients pose different challenges, it is imperative to understand provider concerns prior to the implementation of EM. Our research demonstrates similar concerns between adult and pediatric programs, with the addition of significant concern surrounding EM in very young children. Practice Implications: Understanding pediatric specific concerns with regards to EM will allow for the proper development and implementation of pediatric EM programs, allowing us to assess safety, feasibility, and ultimately outcomes.

"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Opinion dynamics models are an important field of study within the agent-based modeling community. Agent scheduling elements within existing opinion dynamics models vary but are largely unjustified and only minimally explained. Furthermore, previous research on the impact of scheduling is scarce, partially due to a lack of a common taxonomy with which to discuss and compare schedules. The Synchrony, Actor type, Scale (SAS) taxonomy is presented, which aims to provide a common lexicon for agent scheduling in opinion dynamics models. This is demonstrated using a generalized repeated averaging model (GRAM) and a generalized bounded confidence model (GBCM). Significant differences in model outcomes with varied schedules are given, along with the results of intentional model biasing using only schedule variation. We call on opinion dynamics modelers to make explicit their choice of schedule and to justify that choice based on realistic social phenomena."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Recent work in medical sociology has provided critical insights into distinguishing between obesity as a condition with severe individual- and population-level health consequences, and obesity as a socially undesirable, stigmatizing construct opposing thinness as the healthy ideal. Less often considered is the role of body mass index (BMI) as the standard by which obesity and healthy weight are measured and defined. Addressing this issue, I begin by distinguishing between BMI as an empirical, objective measure of health, and BMI as an arbitrary, subjective label for categorizing the population. I further consider how BMI is empowered as a measurable quantity through the lens of medicalization and evidence-based medicine, and introduce the ""performativity"" of BMI as a superior framework for confronting the measure's conceptual limitations. Emphasizing key parallels between BMI and self-rated health as measures with high predictive validity, yet unspecified mechanisms of action, I propose an epistemological shift away from classifying BMI as a biomarker and toward a more flexible view of the measure as a holistic appraisal of health. In closing, I argue that researchers may continue to leverage BMI' s ease of collection and interpretation, provided they are attuned to its definitional ambiguity across diverse research methods and contexts."
Business	"People often share their experiences with others who were not originally present, which provides them with both personal and interpersonal benefits. However, most prior work on this form of sharing has examined the decision to share one""s experience only after the experience is over. We investigate a distinct, unexplored aspect of the sharing process: when the decision to share is already salient during an experience and hence can impact the experience itself. We examine this research question within the context of photo-taking, an increasingly ubiquitous and integral part of people""s experiences. Across two field and three laboratory studies, we find that relative to taking pictures for oneself (e.g., to preserve one""s memories), taking pictures with the intention to share them with others (e.g., to post on social media) reduces enjoyment of experiences. This effect occurs because taking photos with the intention to share increases self-presentational concern during the experience, which can reduce enjoyment directly, as well as indirectly by lowering engagement with the experience. We identify several factors that moderate the effect of photo-taking goals on enjoyment, such as individual differences in the extent to which individuals care about how others perceive them and the closeness of the intended audience."

Ethics	"According to a widespread view, the same constraints that limit the use of otherwise immoral measures in individual self-defense apply to collective self-defense too. I try to show that this view has radical implications at the level of jus in bello, implications which have not been fully appreciated. In particular, if the necessity condition must be satisfied in all cases of killing in war, then most fighting would turn out to be unjust. One way to avoid this result is to adopt a contractualist view of killing in war, a view which interprets the necessity condition in a way that is more permissive with regard to killing combatants in war. At least in this respect, a contractualist view of killing in war has an advantage over other candidates in explaining how wars might be fought justly."
Demography	"BACKGROUND Studies of trends and tempo corrections of fertility have focused on female rather than male fertility; one reason being that the necessary detailed data are more widely available for mothers than for fathers. OBJECTIVE The objective is to present a demographic overview of the fertility trends of Danish men and women from 1980 to 2010. We review the differences in male and female fertility and perform separate tempo corrections for fathers and mothers. METHODS The material for this study consisted of basic data on male and female fertility. The data included all children born in the period, specified by birth year of the child and age and parity of the mother and father, respectively. We used standard demographic measurements of fertility, primarily the total fertility rate (TFR) and the tempo-corrections as proposed by Bongaarts and Feeney (1998). RESULTS The female fertility rates were generally higher than those for males, but the TFRs of both Danish men and women generally increased over the period. The unadjusted and the adjusted fertility rates had similar patterns for men and women. A negative tempoeffect was more evident for women than for men, and a vanishing effect for men at the end of the period was not similarly observed for women. CONCLUSIONS We have exemplified tempo corrections for male as well as female fertility, and have discussed specific problems in this context. Our study indicates that the postponement of childbearing is about to end for Danish men."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose. This study explores the reality of implementing policy guidelines that promote the inclusion of learners with disabilities in mainstream schools. According to the department of education in South Africa, learners who can satisfactorily be educated in an ordinary or mainstream school should be accommodated there. Method. The Craig handicap assessment and reporting technique were used to identify activity limitations and participation restrictions of learners with paraplegia/paraparesis in the mainstream school setting in the Western Cape, South Africa. The Craig hospital inventory of environmental factors identified contextual factors that facilitate or restrict the participation of learners. The views of the learners, teachers and parents were compared in order to identify the facilitators and barriers that influence the participation of physically disabled learners in mainstream schooling. The study population comprised 15 learners between the ages of 6 and 14 years old with paraplegia/paraparesis, their parents and relevant class teachers in 13 mainstream schools of the Western Cape, South Africa. Results. Findings indicate that cognitive independence and mobility are the two areas that most restricted the participation of the learners in the school. Resource availability, social support and equality were critical to facilitating the inclusion of learners at mainstream schools. Conclusions. It is recommended that a comprehensive research project be undertaken. Teacher support and training is essential for keeping the educators motivated and informed. Physical assistance to the learners should be provided in a structured and appropriate way. Physical accessibility, transport and medical information should be addressed at the institutional (school) level and is not the responsibility of the parents or caregivers of the disabled learners."
Gerontology	"Intergenerational help and care among members of the family belong to the most important dimensions of contemporary welfare regimes. Recent research has indicated that a major part of caring responsibilities is placed on the middle-aged generation. The 'pivot generation' is expected to provide help to their adult children and grandchildren as well as to their ageing parents. It has been hypothesised that people helping their parents are discouraged from looking after their grandchildren because they experience lack of energy and time. Using data from the four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this paper analyses the effect of providing help to ageing parents on the likelihood and intensity of looking after grandchildren. It takes a four-generation perspective: grandchildren, children, parents and grandparents. The results show that the support of parents is not associated with less-frequent and less-intense care of grandchildren. On the contrary, a positive association between caring responsibilities has been observed. The highest tendency to care for grandchildren has been found for people regularly helping their parents. This effect holds after controlling for grandparents' characteristics and country effects. It is suggested that caring responsibilities tend to accumulate rather than compete with one another and therefore could represent a potential risk of overburden for those who have a general tendency to care."
"Education, Special"	"The study was conducted in a school for special education with small classes of six to 12 students. The aim was to illuminate how students' understanding of written assessments could be related to assessment for learning. Twenty-nine students were asked to describe their understanding of written assessment in three different subjects and, further, to describe their perceptions in follow-up interviews. The two-step analysis first focused on individual understanding. Thereafter Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (ZPD) was used as analytical tool. In the first analysis three categories were identified. Students' understandings were related to subject matter knowledge, generic skills and attitudes. The findings of the second analysis indicated that written assessment often lacked formative features and cannot be seen as learning in the ZPD. Difficulties with schoolwork were seen as problems of the individual and the measures were directed towards the student. Even though the guidelines ask for a relational perspective a categorical perspective sometimes was adopted in the assessments. The implications of the study relate to the ways teacher's assessment competences can encompass students' understanding and how this can be translated into action."
International Relations	"I advance an endogenous explanation for the systemic transformation of international politics and offer to neatly resolve the debate between offensive realism and defensive realism through a social evolutionary approach. I contend that international politics has always been an evolutionary system and it has evolved from an offensive realism world to a defensive realism world. Consequently, offensive realism and defensive realism are appropriate grand theories of international politics for two different historical epochs. Different grand theories of international politics are for different epochs of international politics, and different epochs of international politics actually need different theories of international politics. Because international politics has always been an evolutionary system, non-evolutionary approaches will be intrinsically incapable of shedding light on the evolution of the system. The science of international politics must be a genuine evolutionary science and students of international politics must 'give Darwin his due'."
Social Work	"Coming from a critical youth studies perspective, this article sketches a participatory action research project designed by youth and adults in New York City to evaluate the impact of neo-liberal public policies on young people. Through telling the counter-story of the Polling for Justice (PFJ) project, we propose that re-considering accountability at the point of knowledge production is generative for re-imagining and realising a more just world. PFJ examined young people's experiences of urban public policy and through embodied participatory research, privileging young people's knowledge of the everyday, attempted deep accountability, provoked precarious solidarity, and activated change.

"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Long-running household-based panels tend to top-up (or refresh) their samples on occasions over the life of the panel. The motivation for adding such samples may range from concerns about overall sample size, lack of population coverage or inadequate samples of small target groups. In 2011, a general top-up sample was added to the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a decade after the original sample was selected. This top-up sample added 2150 responding households to the main sample of 7400 responding households, representing a 29 per cent increase in the overall sample size. These top-up samples can be used to improve the cross-sectional and longitudinal weights. Drawing on the experience of other large household-based panels, this paper evaluates six options for integrating the two HILDA samples. The evaluation considers the variability in the weights, bias and the root mean square error of a range of key estimates. The method that performs the best pools the samples together by estimating the sampling and response probabilities for the sample that each unit could have been but was not actually selected into."
Transportation	"In the Netherlands, many (mainly larger) train stations suffer from capacity shortages for bicycle parking as the result of a large increase in the use of the bicycle as a feeder mode. Sharing of parked bicycles with arriving train passengers who are in need of a bicycle for some time would decrease the number of parked bicycles and reduce the capacity shortage. The paper explores to which extent sharing of these bicycles relieves the capacity problem by investigating the maximum potential for reducing the peak of parked bicycles. This is the potential of the case when all considered participants (bicycle owners and those who are in need for a bicycle) are willing to share. The analyses are based on data of the Dutch National Travel Survey. The main result is that the potential is likely to be modest. The estimated maximum is for the large stations between 13% and 50%, the actual potential is likely to be significantly lower. The large range for the maximum can partly be explained by the uncertainty about the number of arriving train passengers that might shift to the bicycle for the last mile if sharing increases bicycle availability. A second result is that sharing can have a significant effect on the distribution of parked bicycles over the day. The current peak halfway the day can turn into a dip between two peaks in the traditional morning and evening peak hours."
Law	"Managers' pay, and the way it is determined, can have an important impact on the success of firms, and even of whole economies. While there is a rich literature exploring these issues in the for-profit sector, managerial pay at nonprofit firms has received little attention. Yet nonprofit organizations suffer from agency problems that are similar to, or perhaps even more severe than, those observed at for-profit companies. Accordingly, this Article explores the implications for nonprofit governance of a world in which ""managerial power"" can affect nonprofit pay setting. This Article develops the theory and provides support in the form of original empirical evidence based on data from a large panel of colleges and universities collected across a ten-year period. Our findings support the hypothesis that donors with less leverage suffer from significant agency costs in setting president pay. For example, we find for the first time evidence of an otherwise counterintuitive negative association between the fraction of university revenue provided by current donations and president compensation, which we suggest shows that schools that are less dependent on donors are freer to set high pay. We discuss the implications of these findings for the regulation of nonprofits and for a broader understanding of the pay-setting process at for-profit as well as nonprofit organizations."
Development Studies	"Students with disabilities commonly face barriers when accessing water and using sanitation and hygiene facilities at school. International frameworks have prompted governments to enact local policies that enshrine these rights, guarantee equitable access to education and mandate inclusive infrastructure. This research was designed to explore whether Malawi has translated good policies into practice. Data were gathered in Rumphi district, Malawi, through structured field observations in ten schools and interviews with students with a disability (n=23), teachers (n=11) and government stakeholders (n=2). No school had facilities that fully meet the needs of students with disabilities, and private schools were not necessarily better. The cost of bringing existing infrastructure up to standard was on average MK54 000 (US$78). However, proactive consultation with children with a disability is likely to generate alternative low-cost short-term solutions. Increased government support, budgeting and enforcement is necessary to ensure international standards and national policies are met."
Environmental Studies	"Brazil has become an agricultural powerhouse, producing roughly 30 % of the world's soy and 15 % of its beef by 2013 - yet historically much of that growth has come at the expense of its native ecosystems. Since 1985, pastures and croplands have replaced nearly 65 Mha of forests and savannas in the legal Amazon. A growing body of work suggests that this paradigm of horizontal expansion of agriculture over ecosystems is outdated and brings negative social and environmental outcomes. Here we propose four strategies that can reduce deforestation, while increasing production and social wellbeing. First, eliminate land grabbing and land speculation through designation of public forests. This would clarify land tenure and limit the pool of land available for uncontrolled expansion of agriculture and ranching. Second, reduce deforestation on private properties by implementing existing mechanisms in Brazil's Forest Code to facilitate payments for environmental services, with support from market initiatives for sustainable sourcing of agricultural products. Third, incentivize increased productivity on medium and large properties through targeted investments. By stimulating adoption of proven technologies for sustainable intensification, this would help meet Brazil's production targets and growing international demand for agricultural products, without expanding into new production areas. Finally, foster economic, environmental and social improvements through technical assistance to small farmers. Small farmers occupy a large swath of the Amazon and often lack access to technical assistance, production technology, and markets. Providing quality technical assistance to small farmers could help them better align production practices with local opportunities; increase household income and improve livelihoods; and reduce deforestation pressure. By implementing these four strategies in a coordinated effort between public and private agents, Brazil can show the world how to reduce deforestation while increasing agricultural output, reestablishing its leadership in managing natural resources and mitigating climate change."
Nursing	"Problem: Pediatric ICUs (PICU) that have adopted family-centered care models welcome families to the critically ill child's bedside to partner with clinicians in decision-making and the provision of care. The aim of this review was to synthesize the evidence on the impact of critical illness and injury on families of children admitted to the PICU to identify research needs in pediatric critical care. Eligibility criteria: This systematic review included quantitative and qualitative studies that examined the experiences of families of children admitted to a PICU published between 2005 and 2019. Sample: 33 articles were selected for inclusion in the final analysis after screening those identified by searches in CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and reference lists of included publications. Results: Main parental stressors included the sights and sounds within the PICU, child acuity, changes to family functioning and parenting role, and uncertainty of the child's outcome. The most common need of parents was to be well-informed. Psychological, physical, and social impact of hospitalization were experienced by parents from days after admission to years after discharge. Spirituality was identified as a coping mechanism in half of the studies. Conclusions: Parents experience negative effects of the ill child's admission to the PICU and to PICU exposure.

Industrial Relations & Labor	"Once educational attainment and other observable characteristics have been controlled for, studies show that the gender wage gap among adult full-time workers is about half the size it was in 1980. Using U.S. Census and Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 1959 through 1999, the authors investigate the extent to which the decline in this gap was associated with changes across cohorts in the relative rate of wage growth after labor market entry (slopes), versus changes in relative earnings levels at labor market entry (levels). They find that slope changes associated with post-schooling investments, including work experience, account. For no more than one-third of the narrowing of the gender wage gap over the past 40 years, The majority of the narrowing can be attributed to factors present at the time that successive cohorts entered the labor market., such as a growing demand for women's unobserved skills or declining discrimination."
Demography	"European Union (EU) enlargements in 2004 and 2007 were accompanied by increased migration from new-accession to established-member (EU-15) countries. The impacts of these flows depend, in part, on the amount of time that persons from the former countries live in the latter over the life course. In this paper, we develop period estimates of duration expectancy in EU-15 countries among persons from new-accession countries. Using a newly developed set of harmonized Bayesian estimates of migration flows each year from 2002 to 2008 from the Integrated Modelling of European Migration Project, we exploit period age patterns of country-to-country migration and mortality to summarize the average number of years that persons from new-accession countries could be expected to live in EU-15 countries over the life course. In general, the results show that the amount of time that persons from new-accession countries could be expected to live in the EU-15 nearly doubled after 2004."
"Education, Special"	"This qualitative study explores reasons that experienced teachers of students with emotional and/or behavioral disorders give for remaining in their field. Previous research, usually conducted among the wider population of special education teachers, has focused on the relationship of employment and demographic factors to attrition and has primarily relied on quantitative surveys. The researcher sought to expand that body of work through the use of in-depth interviews with teachers who have continued teaching students with emotional and/or behavioral disorders for more than 6 years. In discussing career decisions, these teachers consistently pointed to the importance of personal characteristics, such as the fit between their personality and the demands of the job. These findings point to the importance of recruiting appropriate candidates for this field and helping pre- and in-service teachers develop the personal skills necessary to cope with the unique demands of the job."
Ethics	"Jus post bellum is the 'new' part of just war theory that deals with questions of post war justice. While many argue for this extension of just war theory, there is no agreement on the content and scope of post war norms. The debate on jus post bellum is often presented as one between so-called 'minimalists' and 'maximalists'. This article analyses these main positions and the supposed differences between them, and argues that this distinction is no longer relevant. There is no clear opposition between the two positions, but there are gradual variations in terms of content and scope of jus post bellum. In order to pinpoint these variations, a broader perspective is taken. The article thus aims to demonstrate that the content and scope of post war norms depends on two factors: the particular situation to which just war theory applies, and the general view on just war theory and international relations that is adopted. These factors explain the general shift towards a maximalist understanding of jus post bellum."
Information Science & Library Science	"Portico, a digital preservation archive for the scholarly community and a National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) partner, has successfully extended the NDIIPP network to include a diverse and broad set of publishers and libraries through the development of a model that encourages institutions of all sizes to participate in digital preservation. Over the past two and a half years of archive operations, Portico has learned a number of lessons-most importantly that responsiveness to community needs is key to successful preservation."
History Of Social Sciences	"Magda Arnold (1903-2002), best known for her pioneering appraisal theory of emotion, belonged to the second generation of women in psychology who frequently experienced institutional sexism and career barriers. Following her religious conversion, Arnold had to contend with the additional challenge of being an openly Catholic woman in psychology at a time when Catholic academics were stigmatized. This paper announces the discovery of and relies upon a number of previously unknown primary sources on Magda Arnold, including approximately 150 letters exchanged by Arnold and Father John Gasson. This correspondence illuminates both the development of Arnold's thought and her navigation of the career challenges posed by her conversion. I argue that Gasson's emotional and intellectual support be considered as resources that helped Arnold succeed despite the discrimination she experienced. Given the romantic content of the correspondence, I also consider Arnold and Gasson in the context of other academic couples in psychology in this period and argue that religious belief ought to be further explored as a potential contributor to the resilience of women in psychology's history."
"Business, Finance"	"In a recent paper, Goncalvez and Salles (2008) (G-S) report that developing countries adopting the inflation targeting (IT) regime experienced greater drops in inflation and GDP growth volatility than non-inflation targeting developing countries. In this paper, I find that the G-S results do not hold up when their analytical framework is employed in the context of a more rational and larger sample of developing countries that controls for the comparability of monetary regimes as suggested by Ball (2010). In particular, adoption of an IT regime did not help reduce inflation and growth volatility in developing countries compared to the average experience with other monetary regimes and was no more advantageous in these regards than the adoption of a hard or crawling peg exchange rate regime. As such, the less technically demanding monetary regime of currency pegging remains an attractive regime option for policymakers in developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Gerontology	"Studies of the relationship between retirement and subsequent health, including longevity, have produced mixed findings. One reason may be that these studies have not taken attitudes toward retirement into account. In the current study we examined whether attitudes toward retirement can impact longevity. The cohort consisted of 394 participants who were followed for 23 years. As predicted, participants with positive attitudes toward retirement at the start of the study lived significantly longer than those with negative attitudes toward retirement. The positive attitudes-toward-retirement group had a median survival advantage of 4.9 years. This survival advantage remained after controlling for relevant covariates, including age, functional health, socio-economic status, and whether employed or retired. Our findings suggest that psychological planning for retirement is as important as the more traditional forms of planning."
Area Studies	"Research on African economies has arrived at the third stage of perceptions in recent times after ""Africa's growth tragedy"" and ""Emerging Africa,"" we have now come back down to earth. An analysis of five stylised facts contributes to the sobering account: per capita income levels rising only moderately; ""hyperglobalisation"" or ""peak trade"" in the world economy likely coming to an end; African economies exhibiting limited structural change; employment and labour productivity trends going somewhat in the wrong direction and at the expense of manufacturing; and industrialisation peaking earlier in global development and at lower levels of employment, rendering an industry-led development path for Africa even more difficult than previously thought. By analysing these trends, we are better able to pinpoint the challenges that governments, parliaments, and the private sector will face in terms of defining policies to sustain the impressive record of the growth period in Africa which began in the mid-1990s and continues today. As the continent's growth was, despite inflated figures on African middle classes, not inclusive enough, sympathy for all sorts of cash transfer programmes, including unconditional transfers, is rising in formerly reticent quarters. Fresh excitement over social subsidies in Africa should, however, not come at the expense of smart productive subsidies, which have the potential to tackle the agro-industrial root causes of the limited structural change recorded."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"A film contains an amalgamation of diverse features and provides audiences with a variety of reminiscent elements. Thus, this study aimed to identify the role of nostalgia in the involvement, familiarity, and behavioral intentions of potential film tourists. Thus, 610 respondents were selected to test a conceptual model explaining the role of nostalgia. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed. Results indicated that, to some extent, nostalgia is an influential concept in explaining film tourism. The efficacy to explain the effects of nostalgia on involvement, familiarity, and behavioral intention showed relatively different. In particular, reminiscence of mimicking and desire to buy brand products were the most significant predictors in explaining other constructs, whereas the influence of the contents of the story on behavioral involvement was not significant."
Urban Studies	"In today's postindustrial economy, the extent to which cities and neighborhoods can develop and promote their cultural assets has become a key strategy for maintaining competitiveness by attracting tourism, investment, and job and population growth. These cultural modes of urban development fit the logic of the urban growth machine, in that they foster ideologies of place to encourage investment and enhance the profitability of the local economic base. This article examines the often-neglected role of the local newspaper in this process by focusing on how the Los Angeles Times represents one neighborhood-Koreatown, Los Angeles-over an approximately forty-year period. Through critical discourse analysis, this article unpacks four discursive frames used by the local newspaper and analyzes how these frames commodify cultural communities for consumption by the urban elite."
Ethnic Studies	"In the decade following 9/11, numerous studies have confirmed that anti-Muslim prejudice, commonly referred to as Islamophobia, has become a prominent feature of many societies. As a result, Muslims have been demonised and subjected to discrimination in various ways. While the role of sensationalist media and Far Right groups in perpetuating Islamophobia has been widely commented on, not enough attention has been given to the role played by mainstream politicians in fostering Islamophobia. In this article, I examine how British Cabinet ministers of the Labour Government represented Muslims and Islam in speeches given between 2001 and 2007. Using discourse analysis, I deconstruct the representations of Islam and Muslims in 111 speeches made by these influential ministers. I also consider the discourse surrounding related issues such as multiculturalism, Britishness, integration and terrorism. I argue that Islamophobia based on generalisations, assumptions and stereotypes of Islam and Muslims were present in the speeches. Thus, this article calls for an awareness of the way in which mainstream politicians in Britain have been involved in stigmatising Islam and Muslims, and perpetuating Islamophobia."
Cultural Studies	"Dialogos de la vida del soldado (1552) by the Spanish veteran Diego Nunez Alba seems to be unjustifiably neglected in scholarship, especially when considering the overall interest in memoirs and autobiographies by other early modern Spanish soldiers. This neglect is peculiar considering the fact that the Dialogos are not only an instructive example of the writing of life stories in early modern Europe and the literary conventions that influenced it, but also an extraordinary source of information on the motivations of early modern soldiers to write their life stories. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the frustration and hopelessness that often drove veterans of the Spanish tercios to attempt to address powerful political and military figures for financial and personal assistance and patronage by harnessing and employing established humanistic literary methods and conventions."
Education & Educational Research	"This paper examines how and why academics in different parts of the academy collaborate. In this paper we argue that: (1) There is a useful analytical distinction to be made between collaboration (fluid and expressive) and Collaboration (concrete and instrumental); (2) These two are not mutually exclusive and their use varies between disciplines; and (3) This distinction is an informative one for policy making that aims to encourage collaboration. Two interview based studies were used to explore the differences in collaborative practices across disciplines. The first was small and confined to a single university (n = 36) and the second was a larger study conducted in three countries (n = 274). Cross tabulations and analysis of open ended questions demonstrated many differences across the humanities, sciences and social sciences in collaboration. The C/collaboration distinction proves useful in understanding different disciplinary approaches to research, and in pointing to implications for research policy and funding. Attempts to increase collaborative research through Collaboration only, may well have deleterious effects on both collaboration and Collaboration. Research policy and funding should bear these differences in mind when seeking to stimulate collaborative research, so as to gain better outcomes across a range of disciplines."
Social Issues	"We examine the official scope and actual coverage of immigrant civil society in seven California cities using a widely employed 501(c) 3 database. First, we code immigrant organizations in official data and compare their number and proportion with population statistics; we find substantially fewer immigrant organizations than we would expect. Second, we measure the organizational undercount of immigrant civil society by calculating the number of publicly present immigrant organizations not captured in official data. We do this for four immigrant-origin communities (Indian, Mexican, Portuguese, and Vietnamese) using 160 key informant interviews and extensive examination of directories and media (ethnic and mainstream). We find a notable undercount, which varies by city and immigrant group. Considering both underrepresentation and undercounts, Mexican-origin organizations seem at a particular disadvantage. Our findings carry important implications for resource inequalities and advocacy capacity in minority communities, underscoring the need for further research on the vitality of immigrant civil society."
Transportation	"The team orienteering problem (TOP) aims at finding a set of routes subject to maximum route duration constraints that maximize the total collected profit from a set of customers. Motivated by a real-life automated teller machine cash replenishment problem that seeks for routes maximizing the number of bank account holders having access to cash withdrawal, we investigate a generalization of the TOP that we call the team orienteering problem with overlaps (TOPO). For this problem, the sum of individual profits may overestimate the real profit. We present exact solution methods based on column generation and a metaheuristic based on large neighborhood search to solve the TOPO. An extensive computational analysis shows that the proposed solution methods can efficiently solve synthetic and real-life TOPO instances. Moreover, the proposed methods are competitive with the best algorithms from the literature for the TOP. In particular, the exact methods can find the optimal solution of 371 of the 387 benchmark TOP instances, 33 of which are closed for the first time."
Sociology	"Gardening offers college students a direct connection to the raw material they use in cooking classes. The added pleasure that comes with handling extremely fresh vegetables can enhance their cooking technique, point up the environmental advantages of local produce, and inform their menu development. Garden experience can also give entry-level culinary graduates a leg up in the farm-to-table restaurant market. This case study describes how a garden initiative developed to enhance culinary education became embedded within the subculture of college clubs and social activism. It builds on the large body of scholarship which has demonstrated the personal, educational, and social benefits that come with student gardening and nature connections in an urban setting. It demonstrates that when culinary gardening does not fit into the landscape of the college it can flourish on the fringes of the institution. For working-class students in a public urban college, the value of gardening is embedded in the personal, social, and gustatory pleasures that come from garden-related activities on campus. What happens in the garden does not stay in the garden; it informs school culture and the college experience."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article takes as its starting point the idea that re-emerging infectious disease has become a paradigmatic way of thinking about disease. The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of 'preparedness' within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness Links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus. By articulating this relationship, this article contributes to understandings of the implications of 'molecular' constructions for the biopolitical regulation of the global population."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This research is an exploratory study that examines collaboration at the institutional level in the tourism sector of the Central Region, Ghana. The research begins with a review of the key issues related to collaboration in tourism planning and development followed by an extensive exploration of three main issues related to institutional collaboration in tourism in the Central Region. The three main issues are the vision of tourism development shared among stakeholders, collaboration and coordination within the public sector and between the public and private sectors and the factors that constrain and facilitate collaboration and coordination. Using extensive interviews with key stakeholders and reviewing policy documents, the research indicates low levels of collaboration between tourism institutions both within the public sector and across the public-private sectors. This is notwithstanding a shared awareness of the benefits of collaboration among all actors. The research thus contributes interesting insights into the politics of collaboration in tourism destinations. Given tourism's contribution to the Ghanaian economy, it is imperative that efforts are made towards improving the levels of collaboration and coordination between tourism agencies and institutions."
Business	"Do financial sector groups act as passive policy takers, or do they 'shape' the policies to which they are subject? This article responds to this question with three arguments pertaining to the policy shaping power of the financial industry when it comes to international financial standards. First, industry groups confront a number of additional challenges when it comes to lobbying international regulatory bodies, which tend to be more opaque in their decision making and more difficult to hold accountable when they make unpopular decisions. Second, while these groups are sometimes able to shape financial regulatory policy, the extent of this influence is more partial and contingent than most depictions suggest. The third argument advanced is that since the global financial crisis, business groups have had many of their traditional lobbying tools adversely affected, making lobbying a more uphill battle than before. Financial industry groups are able to influence the governance of their own activities and act as 'policy shapers' some of the time, but are less strongly positioned in this role than many existing depictions seem to suggest.

Urban Studies	"Urban redevelopment governances are commonly treated as singular, monolithic entities that are interactively homogeneous, deploying uniform ensembles of policies and practices across their respective cities. This study, alternatively, reveals these formations as adroitly proactive and interactively heterogeneous across their respective cities. Through a racial economy lens, we empirically examine the racial contours of this ""governance heterogeneity"" in one urban setting: Chicago, Illinois. In this frame, a comparative analysis of Chicago's Bronzeville and Pilsen neighborhoods is presented. Both neighborhoods are constituted by different racial profiles: Bronzeville is home to a predominantly African-American population, whereas Pilsen is mostly Mexican and Mexican-American. The study reveals that redevelopment governances are differentially responsive to established, deeply rooted racialized conceptions of ""Blackness"" and ""Latinoness."" As a result, the form and trajectory of redevelopment in both settings has unfolded in markedly different ways."
Cultural Studies	"In business and government, databases contain large quantities of digital transactional data (purchases made, services used, finances transferred, benefits received, licences acquired, borders crossed, tickets purchased). The data can be understood as ongoing and dynamic measurements of the activities and doings of people. In government, numerous database devices have been developed to connect such data across services to discover patterns and identify and evaluate the performance of individuals and populations. Under the UK's New Labour government, the development of such devices was part of a broader policy known as 'joined-up thinking and government'. Analyses of this policy have typically understood joining up as an operation of adding together distributed data about subjects, which can then be used in the service of government surveillance, the database state or informational capitalism. But rather than such technical or managerialist analytics, I argue that topological analytics capture what these database devices enact and do: they materialize the 'individuality' of subjects in intensified, distributed and fluctuating ways and materialize and intensify a logic of what Deleuze describes as modulating controls. Through examples of UK New Labour social policy initiatives over the past decade, I argue that topological analytics can account for these as immanent rather than exceptional properties of database devices and, as such, part and parcel of a governmental logic and ontology of subjects."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"With the global financial crisis posing an ongoing threat to job security, more positive experiences of trade unions were often overshadowed in 2009. The passage and commencement of the Fair Work Act finally brought Work Choices to an end, or so it seemed until leadership change in the federal Liberal Party revived debate over individual contracts at the end of the year. The still difficult relationship between the unions and the Rudd federal government was in evidence throughout the year, and was underlined at the ACTU Congress. The return of Telstra and the major banks to the bargaining table with unions demonstrated a significant shift in the collective bargaining and industrial relations landscape in 2009. Occupational health and safety issues confronting unions included further developments concerning James Hardie and asbestos, workplace fatalities in the Pilbara and harmonization of occupational health and safety laws."
Geography	"In everyday communication, people effortlessly translate between spatial cognitive frames of reference. For example, a tourist guide translates from a map (the fountain is north-west of the church) into a cognitive frame for a tourist (the fountain in front of the church). While different types of cognitive reference frames and their relevance for language cultures have been studied in considerable depth, we still lack adequate transformation models. In this article, we argue that transformations in current Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are inappropriate to this end. Appropriate transformation models need to go beyond point discretization to take into account vague transformations, in order to deal with forms, sizes, and vagueness of spatial relations relative to ground objects. We argue that neural fields should be used to denote fuzzy positions, directions, and sizes in a particular frame. We propose fuzzy vector spaces to approximate neural field behavior with affine transformations, including fuzzy translation, rotation, and scaling, in order to efficiently transform between different cognitive perspectives. We use an implementation in Haskell to describe a geographic map from the perspective of six well-known cognitive frames of reference. Based on these findings, we give an outlook on the principles of a neural GIS."
Public Administration	"Public policy for private higher education reveals many characteristics associated with decentralized, pluralist systems. Private higher education emergence often comes through initiative outside government, with government unprepared to act. Government and government policy have not usually been the central driving forces for the sector's appearance. However, government supervision is growing, commonly through delayed regulation, and indirect forms of government funding are also growing. Moreover, realities vary by world region and country and even sometimes by province or other sub-national entity. Further variation depends greatly on the type of private higher education in question. Government funding and regulation is often different depending on whether private higher education is identity based (religious or otherwise), elite/semi-elite, or demand-absorbing in respectable or shoddy ways. Additionally, whatever the present realities of public policy, the arguments for and against more government funding and regulation vary by private type."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Using a unique sample of 5,022 workers in 94 large German work-places, the authors explore whether and how women's access to higher level positions, firms' human resources practices, and workers' qualification levels are associated with gender differences in earnings. First, they find that having more women in management reduces the gender earnings gap for jobs with low qualifications, but not those with high qualifications. Second, they find that while men's compensation is positively affected by having a male supervisor, women with a female supervisor do not receive such an advantage. Finally, they find that human resources practices and job-level qualifications moderate the association between gendered power and gender earnings inequalities. Integrating women into managerial and supervisory roles does not automatically reduce gender inequalities; its impacts are contingent on organizational context."
Economics	This article presents reconsideration of whether the monetary policy in the late 1980s was delayed. No report in the literature describes studies evaluating past monetary policy using the model-consistent latent variable from Bayesian estimation. No delay of monetary policy can be found.
Ethics	"There are certain acts necessary to exercise the legal profession within an adversary system that are usually morally condemned by public opinion. If the lawyer knows that his or her client is guilty and is aware, therefore, that he or she deserves punishment, defending him or her appears to imply some sort of deceit or interference in the attainment of a just result. The hypothesis defended in the present paper is that the strategies that are usually adopted to rebut public condemnation have not been successful on account of the moral costs involved in assuming each of them. Strategies based on 'role morality' are not an exception. The purpose of this paper is to offer a rebuttal of the condemnation argument that does not entail any moral cost. This novel counterargument is based on the prospective conception of obligation developed by Michael Zimmerman."
International Relations	"Critics of global democracy have often claimed that the social and political conditions necessary for democracy to function are not met at the global level, and are unlikely to be in the foreseeable future. Such claims are usually developed with reference to national democratic institutions, and the social conditions within national democratic societies that have proved important in sustaining them. Although advocates of global democracy have contested such sceptical conclusions, they have tended to accept the method of reasoning from national to global contexts on which they are based. This article critiques this method of argument, showing that it is both highly idealised in its characterisation of national democratic practice, and overly state-centric in its assumptions about possible institutional forms that global democracy might take. We suggest that if aspiring global democrats - and their critics - are to derive useful lessons from social struggles to create and sustain democracy within nation states, a less idealised and institutionally prescriptive approach to drawing global lessons from national experience is required. We illustrate one possible such approach with reference to cases from both national and global levels, in which imperfect yet meaningful democratic practices have survived under highly inhospitable - and widely varying - conditions."
Transportation	"There has been significant growth in research on intermodal transport in freight distribution since the 1990s. Differentiating itself from previously published literature reviews, this paper evaluates the current state of this research using Systematic Literature Review methodology. The complementary aims are: (a) to identify the research lines developed and to propose a criterion for classifying the literature, and (b) to discuss the empirical evidence that identifies existing interrelationships. The analysis has enabled three main lines of research to be identified. The first research line, basic principles of intermodal transport, groups together works related to the definition of intermodal transport and the results obtained using this transportation system. The second, improvements to the way that intermodal transport systems work, frames elements and variables that impact intermodal transport systems' logistics efficiency, such as quality of service, information and communication systems, and freight planning and linkages among system operators to provide an adequate service. Finally, the third line, intermodal transport system modelling, identifies the main variables used to optimise these transport systems, the different focuses and approaches used in modelling, and the advantages and disadvantages of each focus. These research lines take in more specific sublines that incorporate articles that develop related research questions. Lastly, the discussion of the content of each of these research sublines enables us to identify gaps in the literature and comment on directions for future research."
Transportation	"An approximation algorithm for an optimization problem runs in polynomial time for all instances and is guaranteed to deliver solutions with bounded optimality gap. We derive such algorithms for different variants of capacitated location routing, an important generalization of vehicle routing where the cost of opening the depots from which vehicles operate is taken into account. Our results originate from combining algorithms and lower bounds for different relaxations of the original problem; along with location routing we also obtain approximation algorithms for multidepot capacitated vehicle routing by this framework. Moreover, we extend our results to further generalizations of both problems, including a prize-collecting variant, a group version, and a variant where cross-docking is allowed. We finally present a computational study of our approximation algorithm for capacitated location routing on benchmark instances and large-scale randomly generated instances. Our study reveals that the quality of the computed solutions is much closer to optimality than the provable approximation factor."
"Education, Special"	"The hidden curriculum, the unwritten rules and standards for social conduct that most people take for granted and learn more or less automatically, poses a challenge for many individuals on the autism spectrum because of deficits in social cognition and social interaction skills. Compounding challenges are cultural factors, such as age, ethnicity, language, religion, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. To date, research on teaching social skills to students with autism spectrum disorders has paid little attention to unspoken social rules, which play a major role in social interactions. This article discusses the cultural factors that can affect the hidden curriculum. In addition, practical strategies to develop and teach hidden curriculum items are suggested along with the importance of understanding these issues."
"Business, Finance"	"The purpose of this study is to examine a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium framework with financial and informational frictions and foreign borrowing in the case of money growth and technology shocks for a small open economy and to analyze the implications of varying degrees of financial integration for aggregate fluctuations and propagation mechanisms in the economy. The existence of informational asymmetries among the agents in the model necessitates financial intermediation in the economy. Moreover, there is uncertainty involved in the production process which leads to collateralized borrowing by firms and, therefore, has to be taken into account in the design of the loan contracts between firms and financial intermediaries. It is shown that increasing financial integration amplifies the effect of a positive, temporary monetary shock on output, consumption, investment, labor demand and loans; whereas it has barely any implication for the impact of a positive, temporary technology shock on the economy.

"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Objective: To assess whether literacy, numeracy, and optimism are related to low-income adults' satisfaction with their healthcare provider's communication skills. Methods: Low-income adults (N = 131) were recruited from seven counties in Indiana through University extension programs. To achieve research triangulation, participants were surveyed and interviewed about their communication satisfaction with health providers. Results: Survey data revealed that four variables significantly predicted satisfaction: age, race, literacy, and optimism. Low-income adults in the current study were more critical of their healthcare provider's communication skills if they were younger, White, functionally literate, and pessimistic. Follow-up interviews confirmed this pattern and suggested it was a byproduct of patient activism. Conclusion: In low-income populations, communication satisfaction may be lower for groups that are traditionally active in doctor-patient interactions (e.g., younger patients, patients with higher literacy skills). Practice implications: Healthcare providers should be aware that older, non-White, optimistic, and literacy deficient patients report greater communication satisfaction than their younger, White, pessimistic, and functionally literate peers. Both groups may be coping with their situation, the former by withdrawing and the latter by actively pushing for a higher standard of care. Healthcare providers should continue to seek out ways to facilitate dialogue with these underserved groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Gerontology	"Aim: To explore the factors that influence the transfer of patients from residential aged care facilities (RACF) to hospital emergency departments (ED), and describe features of improved primary care in RACF that could result in reduced transfer. Methods: a. Three focus groups conducted with family and carers of RACF residents, along with RACF, ED and general practice staff. b. Semistructured one-on-one interviews with nine residents of RACF. Results: Five main themes emerged - staffing and skill mix in RACF, treatment options in RACF, end of life decision-making, communication and bureaucratic requirements. Analysis of the semistructured interviews demonstrated parallel concerns with many of the focus groups indicators. There was a strong but not universal preference among residents to minimise RACF to ED transfer. Conclusions: The transfer of residents from RACF to ED is influenced by multiple interrelated factors, and strategies to reduce transfer should address these."
Transportation	"Modem airports operate under high demands and pressures, and strive to satisfy many diverse, interrelated, sometimes conflicting performance goals. Airport performance areas, such as security, safety, and efficiency are usually studied separately from each other. However, operational decisions made by airport managers often impact several areas simultaneously. Current knowledge on how different performance areas are related to each other is limited. This paper contributes to filling this gap by identifying and quantifying relations and trade-offs between the detection performance of illegal items and the average queuing time at airport security checkpoints. These relations and trade-offs were analyzed by simulations with a cognitive agent model of airport security checkpoint operations. By simulation analysis a security checkpoint performance curve with three different regions was identified. Furthermore, the importance of focus on accuracy for a security operator is shown. The results of the simulation studies were related to empirical research at an existing regional airport."
Criminology & Penology	"Criminological research has long suggested that attitudes concerned with honour and aggression, such as the 'street code', are related to violent offending and victimization. Comparatively, little information is known, however, about the mechanisms through which these attitudes increase violence. Drawing from interactionist perspectives of aggression and subcultural theories, we examine the mediating role of two conflict- related tendencies: disputatiousness and remedial actions. We also examine the extent to which remedial actions moderate the association between disputatiousness and violence. Predictions are tested using longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of young adults in the United States. Results show that conflict-related tendencies mediate the pathways linking the street code to violent offending and victimization. In addition, remedial actions temper the association between disputatiousness and violence involvement."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Conflict of interest is one aspect of governance that has the potential to damage both an organisation and those who govern that organisation. Board directors of sport organisations are faced with a number of influences particular to sport business, which can impact on the process of managing conflict of interest. This research identified processes and attributes that influence directors: selection processes, outside roles, experience, regulation, education, motivation and qualifications. Directors and CEOs drawn from a sample of five Australian Football League (AFL) clubs and members of the AFL commission were interviewed. Data analysis was undertaken using a constructivist grounded theory method, and key processes (selection processes and director education) and attributes (outside roles, experience, regulation, motivation and qualifications) of non-executive directors were identified. By better understanding the influences on board directors in sport organisations, and the impact of these on managing conflict of interest, the potential for damage to the directors and the organisation may be decreased."
Education & Educational Research	"Gratitude, like other positive emotions, has been theorized to help individuals build psychological and social resources and promote resilience and well-being. Some scholars suggest that gratitude may not generate positive outcomes in all cultures. In this study, we examined the relationship of gratitude with school resilience and school well-being, and the potential mediating role of relatedness with key social partners within an Asian cultural context. Participants in the study were 190 secondary students attending one school in Singapore. Results revealed that gratitude was positively associated with school resilience; relatedness with significant others partially mediated this association. The final model also showed a significant sequential pathway from gratitude to relatedness (with significant others), then to school resilience and then to school well-being. Practical implications and limitations of this study are presented."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Data from the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study indicate that, among older Americans with work experience since age 50, approximately 12 percent of men and 32 percent of women never held a full-time career job; the retirement patterns of these non-full-time career older workers are diverse, just as they are for individuals with career jobs"
Cultural Studies	"Florence Chiew interviews Maurizio Meloni on his new book, Impressionable Biologies: From the Archaeology of Plasticity to the Sociology of Epigenetics. The conversation reflects on a number of key themes and arguments in Meloni's work, such as the use of the term 'impressionability' to explore longstanding ideas of the permeable body in constant flux in response to cosmological changes. This notion of the body-porous is one whose history Meloni traces back to ancient traditions and systems of medicine, such as humoralism. In this important book, Meloni makes a compelling argument for questioning the current emphasis on the novelty of biological plasticity as an exclusively contemporary phenomenon, and urges us to take a longer genealogical perspective to appreciate how histories of corporeal plasticity have always been part of deeply gendered, racialized and classed discourses in which social hierarchies have been made through physiological distinctions."
Gerontology	"Objective To evaluate the safety (mortality and readmissions) and efficiency (length of stay) of the hospital-in-the-home delirium pathway (THDP) compared with hospital-based care. Methods Patients admitted to THDP were compared against an age-matched cohort of patients with delirium managed entirely in hospital. Outcome data were obtained through retrospective chart review, and hospital coding was used to identify controls. Results Ninety-six patients were included in this study, of which 46 were managed on THDP. There was a significant frailty and co-morbidity burden with no differences in the demographic profile between groups. Inpatient length of stay was shorter on THDP (THDP mean 8 days, control 11 days; P = .02). One-month mortality was 13% in THDP compared with 24% in the control group (P = .2). One-month readmission was 30% in THDP and 18% in the control group (P = .23). Conclusion The hospital-in-the-home delirium pathway is a promising alternative to in-hospital delirium care for selected patients."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate cognitive impairment in older, ethnically diverse individuals with a broad range of kidney function, to evaluate a spectrum of cognitive domains, and to determine whether the relationship between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cognitive function is independent of demographic and clinical factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred twenty-five adults aged 55 and older with CKD. MEASUREMENTS: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) was estimated using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Cognitive scores on six cognitive tests were compared across eGFR strata using linear regression; multivariable logistic regression was used to examine level of CKD and clinically significant cognitive impairment (score <= 1 standard deviations from the mean). RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 64.9, 50.4% were male, and 44.5% were black. After multivariable adjustment, participants with lower eGFR had lower cognitive scores on most cognitive domains (P < .05). In addition, participants with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30) were more likely to have clinically significant cognitive impairment on global cognition (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.9), naming (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0-3.3), attention (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.3-4.5), executive function (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.9-4.4), and delayed memory (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.9-2.6) but not on category fluency (AOR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-2.0) than those with mild to moderate CKD (eGFR 45-59). CONCLUSION: In older adults with CKD, lower level of kidney function was associated with lower cognitive function on most domains. These results suggest that older patients with advanced CKD should be screened for cognitive impairment. J Am Geriatr Soc 58:338-345,2010."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"In longitudinal studies, investigators often measure multiple variables at multiple time points and are interested in investigating individual differences in patterns of change on those variables. Furthermore, in behavioral, social, psychological, and medical research, investigators often deal with latent variables that cannot be observed directly and should be measured by 2 or more manifest variables. Longitudinal latent variables occur when the corresponding manifest variables are measured at multiple time points. Our primary interests are in studying the dynamic change of longitudinal latent variables and exploring the possible interactive effect among the latent variables. Much of the existing research in longitudinal studies focuses on studying change in a single observed variable at different time points. In this article, we propose a novel latent curve model (LCM) for studying the dynamic change of multivariate manifest and latent variables and their linear and interaction relationships. The proposed LCM has the following useful features: First, it can handle multivariate variables for exploring the dynamic change of their relationships, whereas conventional LCMs usually consider change in a univariate variable. Second, it accommodates both first- and second-order latent variables and their interactions to explore how changes in latent attributes interact to produce a joint effect on the growth of an outcome variable. Third, it accommodates both continuous and ordered categorical data, and missing data."
Development Studies	"The present study econometrically examines the impacts of an improved road transportation system on labor allocation, input use, and livelihood diversification in an economically lagging part of Bangladesh. Before 1998, the northwest part of Bangladesh, home to 22% of nearly 160 million people, was de-linked from the economically advanced eastern part of Bangladesh. On June 23, 1998, the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge (JMB) on the river Jamuna was opened for use. The bridge has established direct road and rail transportation systems between the northwestern part and the eastern part of Bangladesh. Using these phenomena, and linking the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data, HIES2000 and HIES2010, this study elucidates the impacts of improved infrastructure on labor allocation and the input application behavior of the sampled households. Applying the difference-in-difference estimation approach, this study demonstrates that the JMB that has linked the northwest and eastern regions has encouraged labor out-migration, resulting in the most vulnerable day-laborers in both farm and non-farm sectors moving to other jobs with relatively high marginal returns. The improved transportation infrastructure had also increased the daily wage rates, which were lower than the comparison group, and the cropping intensity in the Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. The study, therefore, concludes that investment in infrastructure can be instrumental in unleashing economic growth and alleviating poverty in the economically struggling parts of developing countries."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Reliance on self-rated health to proxy medical need can bias estimation of education-related inequity in healthcare utilization. We correct this bias both by instrumenting self-rated health with objective health indicators and by purging self-rated health of reporting heterogeneity that is identified from health vignettes. Using data on elderly Europeans, we find that instrumenting self-rated health shifts the distribution of visits to a doctor in the direction of inequality favouring the better educated. There is a further, and typically larger, shift in the same direction when correction is made for the tendency of the better educated to rate their health more negatively."
Environmental Studies	"Environmental Kuznets curve theory predicts that rapid economic development will initially and unavoidably create environmental problems until these problems are solved at higher development levels. However, because different economies face different impacts from economic growth, some may find ways to shorten the environmental Kuznets curve. To understand the characteristics of a ""Kuznets curve"" based on Chinese environmental attitudes and the factors that influence these attitudes, we interviewed 3000 randomly selected Chinese adults in 2014 using stratified random sampling in six areas (four provinces and two provincial-scale municipalities) that had been affected by the national Grain for Green program. Our goal was to determine their opinions on China's environmental policy. Based on their responses, we calculated that the minimum value of the environmental Kuznets curve (the income at which priorities change from income to environmental protection) occurred at a per capita income of between 20 200 and 27,00011MB (an increase of 61.6% compared with results from a similar survey in 2004). We found significant impacts of income, education level, age, gender, employment, and region on Chinese environmental choices. To achieve sustainable socioeconomic development, China's government must account for how these factors affect public responses to its policy initiatives. China's government must also find ways to increase personal income faster to speed China's progress along the environmental Kuznets curve."
Management	"Purpose - To investigate the diffusion of online reverse auctions by exploring differences between their early, late and lagging adopters. More specifically, adopter categories are compared against organizational characteristics and auction behavior as a result of learning. Organizational characteristics include number of employees and purchasing authority structure (PAS). Differences in learning are investigated by behavioral manifestations, consisting of the savings achieved, as well as the use of bundles in reverse auctions. Design/methodology/approach - Four hypotheses were developed based on academic and trade literature. Data were collected with a large-scale online survey among members of the Institute for Supply Management, receiving 363 complete and useable responses. Records were split into three adopter categories based on whether the respondent's firm adopted reverse auctions early (before April 2002) or late (after April 2002), or whether the adoption was merely planned. Differences related to the time of adoption were explored via nonparametric chi(2) contingency table analyses. The chi(2) statistic was used to determine whether a hypothesis is supported or rejected. Findings - Adopter categories differ in regards to number of employees, the savings achieved, and their use of bundles. No differences were detected in terms of PAS. Explanations for these findings are provided. Practical implications - The results support the diffusion of online reverse auctions, provide encouragement for their adoption especially also by smaller firms, and suggest that late adopters are not disadvantaged when compared to their early-adopting counterparts. Originality/value - No published studies have investigated the diffusion of online reverse auctions for business-to-business procurement, or explored potential differences between early adopters, late adopters and laggards."
Sociology	"In this article we discuss whether the differentiation of universities as part of the emergence of rankings in Germany throughout the 1990s led to new social selectivity in the choice of institutions of higher education. We focus on the development in the quantitatively important fields of business and economics as well as engineering. We have analyzed data provided by the ""German Center for Research on Higher Education and Science Studies"" from the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005 and have found a trend toward new inequalities in the enrollment in highly ranked universities throughout the 1990s. This, however, had set in before the newly introduced rankings became widely accepted."

Management	"This paper provides a methodology to determine the reasonable concession period that would be advantageous both to the government and the private sector with the impact of risks taken into consideration in the financial evaluation using Monte Carlo simulation and bargaining game theory. The simulation produced a range of concession period for the private sector and government to negotiate. Bargaining game theory was employed in an attempt to find a specific concession period. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, two Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) road projects in the Philippines were used as case studies. The resulting concession period was found to be longer than the actual concession period granted to the private sector indicating the impact of risks in the cash flow. With the proposed methodology, the government could further enhance its policies in processing BOT projects with the end in view of increasing private sector participation in infrastructure development.

Area Studies	"For almost a decade, Afghanistan has been largely off the mainstream global discursive agenda. In this context, Joshua Partlow's recent tome A Kingdom of Their Own: The Family Karzai and the Afghan Disaster is an exception. However, Partlow, who served as the Washington Post's bureau chief in Kabul, offers a delineation grounded in what Edward Said describes as Orientalism. Offering a discourse analysis of Partlow's title as a case study, this paper argues that the Washing Post scribe has portrayed Afghanistan-in line with Orientalist approach-as an unchanging polity. Exoticizing the country at times, Partlow presents Afghanistan as a brutal and inhuman space where practices are grounded in tribal customs instead of rationality. Moreover, Partlow's representation of Afghanistan is aimed at audiences in the Occident. Judging Partlow's representation of Afghanistan against facts, this paper also demonstrates the inaccuracies in Partlow's narrative."
Criminology & Penology	"Policing research has generally focused on easily measured outcome factors such as response time, force usage, and arrest. Empirical studies examining outcomes important to public legitimacy, such as police responsiveness, are less prevalent in the literature. Using observational and interview data from two medium sized cities (Indianapolis, Indiana, and St. Petersburg, Florida), the present inquiry examines how officers respond to noncoercive citizen requests for service during encounters, and the impact that situational and officer characteristics have on their willingness to comply with requests. Results indicate that officers comply with a majority of citizen requests, and even when they do not comply they often provide an explanation why. Encounters involving respectful citizens, wealthier citizens, White officers, and St. Petersburg officers were all more likely to result in compliance, while officers were less likely to comply with requests from younger and older citizens. Moreover, encounters involving White citizens, a greater number of citizen bystanders, and officers with a higher level of education all reduced the likelihood that officers would provide an explanation for denying citizen requests. Policy implications and recommendations for future research and theoretical development are discussed."
Substance Abuse	"This study aims to investigate the current prevalence of smoking, socioeconomic inequality, and main determinants of it among Iranian >= 60 years in 2017. The data of Iranian Rural and Urban Income-Expenditure Survey for 2017 have been obtained from Statistical Center of Iran. The prevalence rate of current smoking, inequality of current smoking through calculating the Concentration Index, and the main socioeconomic determinants of it have been investigated. The current prevalence of tobacco use in the elderly in Iran was about 11%; of which, 9% belonged to men and 2% to women. The most prevalent current tobacco uses in the elderly belonged to the age group of 70-79 years. This rate was lower in the two other borderline groups (under 70 and over 80 years of age). Furthermore, its prevalence was higher in the unemployed and married elderly, compared to their counterparts within each subgroup. Current cigarette smoking is among health problems, especially among the elderly, and its prevalence is significant in Iran."
Health Policy & Services	"Introduction: The 2012 Norwegian Public Health Act stipulates that all Norwegian municipalities need to integrate public health concerns in their decision-making processes at all policy levels. Based on a Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach, population health and health equity are seen as whole-of-government responsibilities, making all municipal actors across sectors and professional boundaries responsible for health issues. Although many municipalities are well on their way towards implementing this goal, several experience a lack of legitimacy and inter-sectoral collaboration, as well as encounter conflicting professional identities. Theory and Methods: In this interview-based case study, we investigate the legitimacy of the HiAP approach in three Norwegian municipalities. We use an institutional perspective to analyse legitimacy, and we discuss how professional identities might relate to the implementation of this inter-sectoral collaboration. Results: Our findings suggest that the three municipalities are in the process of legitimising HiAP. Further, that legitimacy based on the integration of HiAP in planning and management structures and in formal documents seems easier or less complicated to achieve than other types of legitimacy related to personal understanding, values and norms. Conclusions and discussion: We argue that these findings may be related to the possible risk of identity conflicts, which could potentially pose challenges to collaborations, such as HiAP, and then again challenge the implementation of integrated care."
Anthropology	"This paper explores the emergence of a new genre of garments in Eastern Indonesia: 'traditional' uniforms, made from locally hand-woven cloth, which are worn twice weekly by government employees in Kupang, the capital of the province of East Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Timur, or NTT). These uniforms, which appeared following a 1997 regulation, supported the emergence of a new, urban textile culture, and a partial decoupling of traditional clothing from adat, Indonesian customary law, even as they allowed adat to make inroads into government offices. National policy, the agitation of local elites and the innovation and conservatism of artists and ritual practitioners, all contributed to this new form of artistic and cultural expression. While attention has been paid to the domesticating power of the state on local forms of cultural expression, this example shows how attempts at control can also push cultural expressions in unexpected directions."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Social Determinants of Health (SDH) theorists claim that the distribution of social goods such as income, housing and education, has as great or greater an impact on health outcome than does health care, narrowly construed. This article attempts to integrate this claim into a plausible theory of justice. I argue that such a theory must be both political, in that it focuses on goods that states can distribute or regulate effectively and appropriately, and holistic, in that it must integrate the various values that are relevant to distribution into a plausible overall theory. While SDH-based theories are appropriately political, many of their exponents tend to undertake the task of integration in an implausibly monistic manner. I argue that monists about health are caught between the horns of an unattractive dilemma: either they employ a narrow conception of health, in which case their prescriptions are grounded in an implausible conception of the human good, and give rise to an extreme form of paternalism; or they use a broader conception of health, which leads them to address the challenge of holism in a purely rhetorical manner. I argue for a pluralistic mode of integration, one that accepts that social goods are regulated by both consequentialist and non-consequentialist considerations, and that the range of consequences that are relevant do not relate merely to health."
Social Issues	"P>Given that the conception of the person as an autonomous agent is a cultural construction, inquiry is directed to its potentials and shortcomings for cultural life. While such a conception contributes to sustaining the moral order, it also supports an individualist ideology and social divisiveness. As an alternative to the conception of moral autonomy, I explore the potentials of relational being, an orientation that views relational process (as opposed to individual agents) as the wellspring of all meaning. Such an orientation sees all moral concepts and action as issuing from coordinated action. However, at the same time that relational process generates moral orders, so does it establish the grounds for ""immorality"" and social conflict, which undermines the relational process of creating moral order. Thus, a concept of ""second-order morality"" is advanced, which seeks to reestablish a more inclusive first-order morality. Responsibility for productive processes of relationship is invited. Recent innovations in dialogic practices lend themselves to relational responsibility."
Criminology & Penology	"Prisons in modern societies are complex bureaucracies that are subject to regulation through a range of external monitoring and internal inspection mechanisms. Internal inspections are closely connected to the bureaucracies that manage individual prison systems. External monitoring is conducted by international, regional, and national organizations. In theory, international monitoring by organs of the United Nations has a worldwide reach, but its impact in a particular country depends on whether the country has ratified the relevant international instrument and agreed to being monitored. Regional monitoring is particularly prominent in Europe. It is less prominent in other regions. The form that national external monitoring adopts varies greatly between countries. It may be done by a specially created inspectorate, human rights committee, or ombudsman. Local monitoring committees for individual prisons, complaints procedures, and court actions may all serve regulatory functions. These diverse bodies are most effective as monitoring organizations when they are independent, apply clear standards, and have political support. Their efficacy may be increased by international support and the acceptance at the national level of the salience of human rights standards for prison conditions."
Management	"The management of human resources in headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary relationships requires intensive communication, but effective communication often depends on having a shared language. Hence, language differences can be a serious threat to the successful management of human resources in multinational corporations. In this large-scale quantitative study, encompassing data from more than 800 subsidiaries in 13 countries, we investigated four related issues. First, in terms of the importanceof language differences, we found that HQ-subsidiary relationships are clearly affected by language differences and that the latter form a distance category of their own, which should not be subsumed under the related, but separate concept of cultural differences. Second, regarding the consequences of language differences for communicationoutcomes, we found that a lack of a shared language is associated with misunderstanding, conflict and parallel information networks, which could harm HQ-subsidiary interactions. Third, with regard to the impact of language differences on communication methods, we found that a lack of a shared language is associated with a significantly lower level of oral (face-to-face and phone) communication, but not written communication. Fourth, and finally, in terms of a potential solution to communication problems caused by language differences, we found that expatriates can facilitate both communication and knowledge transfer between HQ and subsidiaries."
Area Studies	"As China proceeds with a process of urbanization unprecedented in human history, it maintains an urban-biased governance regime in many areas, including food safety regulation. Using secondary data and interviews with officials from the Changping district in Beijing, this article systematically defines the main characteristics of China's dual food safety regulation regimes, highlighting differences between urban and rural areas in four dimensions: policy structure, funding source, staff structure and resource allocation. This article also provides an explanatory framework to understand this dual regime's development and persistence from a neo-institutionalism perspective. Three main explanatory variables are advanced: historical legacy, dual incentive structures, and dual economic and industrial patterns. While China's urbanization process and governance structure, including the food safety regulatory regime, are not complete by Western standards, we emphasize this problem is best understood by examining China's unique socioeconomic and cultural context."
Communication	"Mechanisms of moral disengagement in violent video game play have recently received considerable attention among communication scholars. To date, however, no study has analyzed the prevalence of moral disengagement factors in violent video games. To fill this research gap, the present approach includes both a systematic literature review and a content analysis of moral disengagement cues embedded in the narratives and actual game play of 17 top-ranked first-person shooters (PC). Findings suggest that moral disengagement factors are frequently embedded in first-person shooters, but their prevalence varies considerably. Most violent video games include justifications of the portrayed violence, a distorted portrayal of consequences, and dehumanization of opponents. Implications of the findings for research on violent games are discussed."
Demography	"This article offers the first examination of its kind of the content and nature of anti-trafficking policy as it is pursued in Benin. The article draws on data gathered from policy and project documents and from interviews and participant observation with actors integral to the constitution of policy in (and with influence over) the Beninese anti-trafficking community. It attempts to bridge the oft-lamented gap between page and practice by conducting analysis not only of the representation of policy in text, but also of its lived manifestations in processes, interactions and structures. It argues that the various different actors that comprise Benin's anti-trafficking pantheon seek to accomplish one fundamental goal - to protect children from trafficking - through two overarching strategies - the promotion of healthy' childhoods and the pre-emptive prevention of child movement. The article examines each of the main strands of policy and concludes by offering a Foucauldian analysis of their operation. It thus fills a major gap in the academic understanding of anti-trafficking policy in the Beninese context."
Public Administration	"It is well established in the public management literature that boundary spanners - people or groups that work across departments or sectors - are critical to the success of whole of government and joined-up working. In studying recent unprecedented change to central government agencies in the Australian context, our research identified that intra-departmental boundary spanners also play a critical role in the functioning of government departments, particularly during restructuring. Although most contemporary literature in public management concentrates on boundaries across formal organisational entities (departments, agencies, sectors), boundaries also exist within departments. Our research has found that without dedicated intra-departmental boundary spanners, significant role confusion and dysfunctional practices arise. In turn, this has serious implications for the quality of policy advice given to Cabinet. Further research needs to be undertaken into both the role of intra-departmental boundary spanners and how to nurture and manage the practice of intra-departmental boundary spanners. This is especially the case if changes in Australia represent a fundamental shift more broadly in the way central government agencies operate. It is well established in the public management literature that boundary spanners are critical to the success of whole of government and joined-up working. In studying recent, unprecedented changes, to central government agencies in the Australian context our research identified that intra-departmental boundary spanners also play a critical role in for functioning, particularly during re-structuring."
Women'S Studies	"European political theorists have argued that contemporary imaginaries of climate change are symptomatic of a post-political condition. My aim in this essay is to consider what this analysis might mean for a feminist green politics and how those who believe in such a project might respond. Whereas much of the gender-focused scholarship on climate change is concerned with questions of differentiated vulnerabilities and gendered divisions of responsibility and risk, I want to interrogate the strategic, epistemological, and normative implications for ecological feminism of a dominant, neoliberal climate change narrative that arguably has no political subject, casts Nature as a threat to be endured, and that replaces democratic public debate with expert administration and individual behavior change. What hope is there for counter-hegemonic political theories and social movements in times like these? I suggest that rather than give in and get on the crowded climate change bandwagon, an alternative response is to pursue a project of feminist ecological citizenship that blends resistance to hegemonic neoliberal discourses with a specifically feminist commitment to reclaiming democratic debate about social-environmental futures."
Cultural Studies	"Drawing on the works of Ahmed, Balibar and Appadurai, this article explores the complex dynamics of stranger making in Europe, with particular focus on the status of immigrants who are marked by systemic racialization. The article offers brief analyses of a series of critical incidents' to illustrate contemporary enactments of stranger making politics in order to examine how theorizations of race and racialization may be shifting in European contexts. It argues that specific notions of nationalism and national identity are being re-configured in the current neoliberal climate of European Union austerity and civil unrest to reify a national us' against those who must be made stranger'."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Objective: To investigate the applied and conceptual relationship between two measures of shared decision making using the OPTION instrument developed in Wales and the Informed Decision Making instrument developed in Seattle, USA using audio-taped consultation data from a UK general practice population. Methods: Twelve general practitioners were recruited from 6 general practices in the southwest of England. One hundred twenty-three GP-patient consultations were audio-recorded. Audiotapes were sent off to, and rated by, respective experts in the use of the OPTION and the Informed Decision Making instruments. Results: Compared to earlier work using the Informed Decision Making tool, consultations in this sample were shorter, had fewer decisions and tended to have a greater number of elements present. Similar to previous research using the OPTION, values using the OPTION instrument were low with two items, giving the patient opportunities to ask questions and checking patient understanding, exhibiting the most variability. Using a 'key' decision in each consultation as the basis for comparison, the Informed Decision Making score was not related to the overall OPTION score (Spearman's rho = 0.14, p = 0.13). Both instruments also predicted different 'best' and 'worst' doctors. Using a Bland-Altman plot for assessing agreement, the mean difference between the two measures was 1.11 (CI 0.66-1.56) and the limits of agreement were -3.94 to 6.16. There were several elements between the two instruments that appeared conceptually similar and correlations for these were generally higher. These were: discussing alternatives or options (Spearman's rho = 0.35, p = 0.0001), discussion of the patient's role in decision making (Spearman's rho = 0.23, p = 0.012), discussion of the pros/cons of the alternatives (Spearman's rho = 0.20, p = 0.024) and assessment of the patient's understanding (Spearman's rho = 0.19, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Measures of shared decision making are helpful in identifying those shared decision making skills which may be problematic or difficult to integrate into practice and provide a tool by which the development of skills can be assessed over time. Research may implicitly place undue Value on those aspects of shared decision making which are most easily measured. Practice implications: Shared decision making tools are a useful way of capturing the presence or absence of specific, shared decision making skills and changes in skills acquisition over time. However there may be limits in the extent to which the concept of shared decision making can be measured and that more easily measured skills will be emphasised to the detriment of other important shared decision making skills.

Nursing	"Problem: Stigma affects not only children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) themselves, but also people connected with them (i.e., parents, siblings). The capacity of parents to provide care is affected by the stigma they perceive. This meta-synthesis encompasses the experiences of affiliate stigma among parents of children with ASD. Eligibility criteria: Articles were limited to the English language, those reported on stigma experienced by parents of children with ASD aged 2-18 years, published between 1940 and 2019. Sample: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus and The Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and twelve articles fitted the selection criteria. The texts of the selected research papers were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Results: Four common themes across parental experiences included felt stigma, enacted stigma, variations in stigma, and contributors to stigmatizing experiences. Conclusions: Highlighting the differences in parents"" views on affiliate stigma is necessary to create awareness about ASD and the stigma linked with this disorder. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Expositions or expos are large consumer trade shows representing a catalyst for on-site direct spending by visitors attracted to these events that are promoted by destination marketing organizations, governments, communities, and businesses. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new research model involving the analysis of five specific personality traits representing pleasure visitors attending an annual expo to provide more meaningful information for destination marketing professionals. This study then examined the effects of how visitor personality traits play upon expo attachment, satisfaction, and revisit intention using anxiety attachment as a moderator. Results revealed the relationships between expo attachment and satisfaction, attachment and revisit intention, and satisfaction and revisit intention were significant. Also, anxiety attachment was shown to moderate the relationships between all visitor personality traits and expo attachment. Accordingly, this study provides theoretical insights for future tourism research and offers new promotional implications for expo practitioners."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"John W. Draper's History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874) is commonly regarded as the manifesto of the 'conflict thesis'. The superficiality of this thesis has been demonstrated in recent studies, but to read Draper's work only as a text on 'science versus religion' is to miss half of its significance, as it also involved evaluations of individual religions with respect to their attitudes towards science. Due to Draper's favourable remarks on Islam, the Ottoman author Ahmed Midhat translated his work into Turkish, and published it along with his own comments on Draper's arguments. Midhat interpreted Islam using the cues provided by Draper, and portrayed it as the only religion compatible with science. While his Christian readers condemned Draper for his approach to Islam, Midhat transformed the 'conflict thesis' into a proclamation that Islam and science were allies in opposition to Christian encroachment on the Ottoman Empire. This paper analyses Midhat's appropriation of Draper's work and compares it to the reaction of Draper's Christian readers. It discusses the context that made an alliance between Islam and science so desirable for Midhat, and emphasizes the impact of the historico-geographical context on the encounters between and representations of science and religion."
Urban Studies	"Although one's neighbourhood is continuously structuring everyday lives and influences encounters between different people, place of residence is only partially the site where interactions and possibly integration between population categories occur. Another well-known domain is the place of work, where many spend hours per day and may meet various 'others'. However, people's mobility is also strongly differentiated between class and ethnicity. Here too, different modes of transport may offer opportunities for encounter and engaging with others. In order to assess exposure to diversity of individuals from various ethnic and social class backgrounds to 'the other' we focus on these three important realms of daily life: neighbourhoods, workplaces and modes of transport We use individual level data from the Mobilities Netherlands Database combined with detailed individual level register data from the Social Statistical Database. We found that, overall, higher income natives are, compared to the other combinations of country of origin and income category most frequently cocooning in homogeneous residential, workplace, and mobility spaces. However, native-Dutch with a low income stand out in the residential domain, where they are living more frequently in homogeneous neighbourhoods than high-income natives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental Studies	"Biodiversity offsets have emerged as one of the most prominent policy approaches to align economic development with nature protection across many jurisdictions, including the European Union. Given the increased level of scrutiny that needs to be applied when authorizing economic developments near protected Natura 2000 sites, the incorporation of onsite biodiversity offsets in project design has grown increasingly popular in some member states, such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Under this approach, the negative effects of developments are outbalanced by restoration programs that are functionally linked to the infrastructure projects. However, although taking into consideration that the positive effects of onsite restoration measures leads to more leeway for harmful project development, the EU Court of Justice has recently dismissed the latter approaches for going against the preventative underpinnings of the EU Habitats Directive. Also, the expected beneficial outcomes of the restoration efforts are uncertain and thus cannot be relied upon in an ecological assessment under Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive. Although biodiversity offsets can still be relied upon whenever application is being made of the derogation clause under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, they cannot be used as mitigation under the generic decision-making process for plans and programs liable to adversely affect Natura 2000 sites. We outline the main arguments pro and contra the stance of the EU Court of Justice with regards to the exact delineation between mitigation and compensation. The analysis is also framed in the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of the EU nature directives. Although ostensibly rigid, it is argued that the recent case-law developments are in line with the main principles underpinning biodiversity offsetting. Opening the door for biodiversity offsetting under the Habitats Directive will certainly not reverse the predicament of the EU's biodiversity. A reinforcement of the preventative approach is instrumental to avert a further biodiversity loss within the European Union, even if it will lead to additional permit refusals for unsustainable project developments."
Women'S Studies	"In 1908, Georgia legislators passed a historic prison reform act that eliminated the convict lease system, replacing it with chain gangs. This article examines black women''s exclusion from the category female and white women''s protection from Georgia''s prison regime as a condition of possibility for the passage of this law. Criminalized black women were forced to endure torturous conditions on chain gangs, while white women were protected from violent conditions. In 1908 Georgia also implemented a domestic carceral sphere, forcing black women to work as domestic servants while serving the final portions of their sentences on parole. Georgia''s prison regime operated to reinforce the capitalist logic of Jim Crow, as well as to forestall challenges to racial and gender hierarchy from black women and men and from white women. The exclusion of black female subjects from the categories female and woman during the consolidation of Jim Crow was central to the process of reinforcing white supremacist patriarchal authority. This unexplored history of Southern punishment as a gendered carceral regime reflects both the violence of imprisonment and the violence of gender categorization."
Gerontology	"OBJECTIVES To determine whether geriatric conditions and functional impairment are independent risk factors for adverse drug events (ADEs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS Three hundred seventy-seven veterans aged 65 and older and taking five or more medications. MEASUREMENTS Geriatric conditions and functional status were assessed using participant interviews and structured assessments at study baseline. ADEs were elicited during participant interviews 3 and 12 months after study enrollment using validated methods. RESULTS The strong majority (97%) of participants were male, with a mean age of 74 +/- 5; 123 (33%) had one or more dependencies in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Over the 1-year study period, 126 participants (33%) developed 167 ADEs. Upon multivariable analysis, risk of ADEs was not associated with any of the geriatric conditions that there was sufficient power to evaluate, including IADL function, cognitive impairment, depression, visual impairment, incontinence, constipation, and a summative measure of geriatric burden comprising the above and history of falls or gait instability. In exploratory analyses, the strongest factor associated with ADEs was the number of drugs added to a participant's medication regimen during the 1-year study period (incidence rate ratio 1.11 per each added drug, 95% confidence interval=1.03-1.19). CONCLUSION Common geriatric conditions and IADL function were not associated with ADEs in a predominantly male, older veteran population. Although it is important to consider the unique circumstances of each participant, excessive caution in prescribing to older adults with these geriatric conditions may not be warranted."
Linguistics	"The question of context is fundamental in the debate on ""What is art?"" What the uses of the term mean colour all debates about life and art. Since I am interested in the interpretation and understanding of context in art, and also in life, as well as in how visual arts reinforce or change our mind-constructs either consciously (intentionally) or automatically, I investigate the place of context within this scheme, while referring to various approaches to context and raise series of questions that offer alternatives and point to difficulties."
Ethics	"While commentators recognize the centrality of the notion of Geist in Hegel's philosophical project, there is no consensus about what the term exactly designates and what its role is within his system. One interpretation, which has (re)appeared on the scene in recent years, overemphasizes the onto-theological connotations of the Hegelian term and understands it as a kind of supernatural or divine force determining the development of the system and guiding human history. Critically opposing this reading and showing its conceptual shortcomings, the paper clarifies Hegel's concept of Geist and discusses its real place in the philosopher's system."
International Relations	"Even during the Kim Jong Un era, the rationing system of North Korea has not yet been recovered. In addition, the thought control system has been weaker than during the Kim Jong Il era. The Kim Jong Un regime stays in power mainly by strengthening political and social control by law enforcement agencies (including police and intelligence agencies). However, there is a lacuna in the control of governmental authority in that giving bribes to public officials enables people to avoid the control. In 2016, social control was strengthened in a situation in which DPRK's economy cannot be improved due to the sanctions imposed by the UN on it. This will exacerbate the instability of the Kim Jong Un regime. Although the unstable factors during the Kim Jong Un era have increased, it is hard to say that those factors will lead to contingency in North Korea under current conditions. Firstly, a change of people's consciousness in North Korea is insufficient to bring about a change in its system. Secondly, it is difficult to mobilize and organize the people's discontent over the Kim Jong-un regime due to the strict control by law enforcement agencies. Thus, a change in the social control system is necessary for fundamental system change in North Korea. To do this, not only further economic sanctions on North Korea and inflow of external information, but also, a lot of pressure especially focused on the North Korean Human Rights Act are required."
Sociology	"This article uses updated purchasing power parity measurements of countries' income and a new strategy for approximating global inequality to examine how global income inequality-as a combination of increasing average within-country inequality and decreasing between-country inequality-changed in the period 1980-2005. In view of the overwhelming influence of China and India on trends in global inequality change, the authors base their strategy on estimating the change in world average within-country inequality from change in within-country inequality of these two countries. The authors find that global inequality decreased continuously throughout the period. They also project that global inequality will likely rise again in the next 25 years unless the stellar economic performance of China and India spreads widely to other developing countries."
Linguistics	"This paper presents a notion of harmonic word order that leads to a new generalisation over the presence or absence of disharmony cross-linguistically : for linkers - syntactically independent, semantically vacuous heads marking a relationship - disharmony is ungrammatical, while for any other head disharmony is simply dispreferred. Harmony is defined here by the interaction of three independently motivated word order constraints operating over the base-generated structure: linear proximity between a superordinate lexical head and the head of its dependent, uniformity in direction of headedness, and the preference for clausal dependents to follow their head. It is proposed that disharmony occurs where either a lexical head or a head bearing syntactic features encoding semantics has an ordering rule of its own. These proposals are shown to be empirically superior to the Final-Over-Final Constraint (Holmberg 2000, Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts 2007 and subsequent work), in terms of both what is permitted and what is disallowed."
Social Work	"This study critically considers the applicability of conceptions of child neglect that have been theorised by British and American scholars and promulgated in African countries through the domestication of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The child protection legislation of five sub-Saharan nations was compared in order to examine the presumptions embedded in their provisions concerning child neglect. These were then appraised in relation to the socio-economic conditions pertaining in each country. Food insecurity, over-reliance on staples and high infection rates among children in conjunction with hard to access health care and poor quality services contest the validity and relevance of dominant Anglo-centric definitions of child neglect and methods for detecting it. The study concluded that greater congruence between national child protection legislation and the socio-economic challenges faced by families in sub-Saharan countries would better protect children against neglect.Key Practitioner Message: . Child neglect is an ethnocentric concept that requires interrogation to test its relevance before applying it to developing country contexts. . In sub-Saharan countries, conditions of absolute poverty and grossly inadequate public services profoundly affect the ability of parents or guardians to meet their children's basic needs. . Laws that frame child protection systems need to recognise the inter-relationship between public services, poverty and parental care in the neglect of children."
Urban Studies	"After being known as the ""murder capital of the world"" in the 1990s, Medellin has pioneered innovative forms of city planning and management and was acclaimed the most innovative city in the world by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in 2013. Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellin has achieved the internationally recognized status of an ""innovative city"". It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which ""urban innovation"" is happening in Medellin, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a ""model"" city in Latin America and beyond."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Objective: To investigate income gradients in motor vehicle traffic injury hospitalisation for vehicle occupants and pedestrians/cyclists among children in urban and rural Canada. Design: Four years (2001/02-2004/05) of acute-care hospitalisation discharge records for children aged 0-19 years were analysed. International Classification of Disease codes were used to determine hospitalisations due to motor vehicle traffic incidents for occupants and pedestrians/cyclists. Rates of injury ( per 10 000 person years) were calculated by neighbourhood income quintiles for urban and rural areas. Results: Among children (0-19 years), rates of vehicle occupant hospitalisation were higher in rural (5.07, 95% CI 4.90 to 5.25) than urban areas (2.08, 95% CI 2.03 to 2.14). In rural areas, children from lower income neighbourhoods had higher vehicle occupant hospitalisation rates than those from the richest neighbourhoods (5.52, 95% CI 5.13 to 5.93 vs 4.30, 95% CI 3.97 to 4.66). In urban areas vehicle occupant hospitalisation rates were similar among children from the poorest and richest neighbourhoods-but higher among children from middle income neighbourhoods. In urban areas, but not rural areas, the hospitalisation rate for pedestrians/cyclists systematically increased with decreasing neighbourhood income. In urban areas the pedestrian/cyclist hospitalisation rate was four times higher for children from the poorest (1.40, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.57) than from the richest (0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43) neighbourhoods. Conclusions: While vehicle occupant and pedestrian/cyclist motor vehicle traffic injuries are more frequent among children from lower income neighbourhoods, gradients are most pronounced for pedestrians/cyclists in urban areas."
Environmental Studies	"The aim of this paper is to optimize the input parameters of diesel engine with respect to hydrocarbon emission and smoke opacity through experimentation and Taguchi approach. Four parameters, namely, compression ratio, fuel injection timing, air temperature, and air pressure were varied at five different levels and their effect on hydrocarbon emission and smoke opacity under no load, half load, and full load conditions were recorded. The optimum combination of control/input parameters leading to the optimum values of performance parameters/response variables, were determined using signal-to-noise ratio, analysis of means, and analysis of variance. Confirmation tests were performed to check the validity of the results, which revealed good agreement between the predicted and the experimental values of the response variables at optimum combination of the input parameters."
Criminology & Penology	"Objectives: A body of literature has demonstrated that the perceived legitimacy of legal authorities is an important predictor of criminal offending. Criminal offending is itself age-graded and good explanations of offending should offer some insight for how it changes as individuals age. This article attempts to address this gap by developing and testing seven hypotheses regarding how legitimacy changes over time. Method: Using panel data from the Pathways to Desistance study, a latent growth model (LGM) for legitimacy examines how evaluations of legitimacy change from adolescence to emerging adulthood as well as what factors influence this change. Results: During the period individuals were involved in the study, the LGM revealed that perceptions of legitimacy increase as individuals progress through adolescence before stabilizing in emerging adulthood. Several theoretical factors were related to individuals' legitimacy evaluations including parental evaluations of legitimacy, family support, emotionality, and self-control. Most importantly, perceptions of procedural justice were found to be related to legitimacy, but this relationship weakened as individuals aged. Conclusions: Evaluations of the legitimacy of legal authorities are, in fact, age-graded. Criminologists should continue to explore the sources of legitimacy evaluations in further developing legitimacy as an important theory of criminal behavior."
Management	"The current study used meta-analytic estimates and path analysis to examine whether the construct of employee engagement (EE) shows incremental validity in the prediction of employee effectiveness (a broad measure of performance-related behaviors) over other job attitudes such as job satisfaction, job involvement, and organizational commitment. Meta-analytic estimates between EE and various employee effectiveness indicators were computed from 49 published correlations representing a total of 22,090 individuals. We combined these estimates with published meta-analytic estimates between employee effectiveness and job attitudes to produce a meta-matrix representing 1,161 unique correlations. Using this meta-matrix, a series of path model comparisons produced two results: (1) EE bears low to moderate incremental validity over individual job attitudes (R-2 change of 0.02 to 0.06), and (2) EE bears low incremental validity over a higher-order job attitude construct representing the combination of other job attitudes in the prediction of a higher-order employee effectiveness construct (R2 change of 0.01). Given the brevity of popular EE measures, the results suggest EE is better conceptualized as a higher-order measure of job attitudes that is an effective and concise predictor of employee effectiveness.

"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Key opinion leaders (KOLs) are physicians and researchers engaged by pharmaceutical companies, most often to speak to audiences of other physicians. This article provides some background information on the structures of pharmaceutical company influence on and control over KOLs. The primary focus of this article, though, is on KOLs' explanations and justifications of their paid work for the companies, on the basis of, among other sources, 13 interviews with high-earning KOLs. Among KOLs' important justifications are ones in terms of the educational value of the talks they give and the benefits gained by patients; these are buttressed by claims about the integrity of the speakers. However, those justifications rarely address pharmaceutical companies' use of KOLs, or larger issues to do with the general influence that pharmaceutical companies have on medical knowledge."
Social Work	"Despite intense focus on child sexual exploitation (CSE) in the UK, little is known about how and why some young people recover well from sustained exploitation by multiple perpetrators. Using thematic analysis, three published memoirs by young people (female) about their sexual exploitation by groups of men in the UK are analysed for insight into what contributes to positive short-and long-term outcomes. Despite the populist nature of the publications, the memoirs offer an important insight into young people's understandings of their exploitation. The rich detail inherent to memoir exposes the complexities and dilemmas faced by the young people and the professionals involved. Being listened and believed by family and professionals is the most significant aspect to positive adaptation post exploitation in these accounts. However, the dynamics of grooming and the nature of contemporary social work intervention and investigation render disclosure difficult. As these accounts illustrate, CSE is characterised by uncertainty and complexity, and this is the domain in which social work needs to intervene more successfully to support young people."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article argues that the excessive focus on cancer as an insidious living defect that needs to be destroyed has obscured the fact that cancer develops inside human beings. Therefore, in order to contribute to debates about new cancer therapies, we argue that it is important to gain a broader understanding of what cancer is and how it might be otherwise. First, in order to reframe the debate, we utilize Pierre Bourdieu's field analysis in order to gain a stronger understanding of the structure of the (sub) field of cancer research. In doing so, we are able to see that those in a dominant position in the field, with high levels of scientific capital at their disposal, are in the strongest position to determine the type of research that is carried out and, more significantly, how cancer is perceived. Field analysis enables us to gain a greater understanding of the complex interplay between the field of science (and, more specifically, the subfield of cancer research) and broader sources of power. Second, we draw attention to new possible ways of understanding cancer in its evolutionary context. One of the problems facing cancer research is the narrow time frame within which cancer is perceived: the lives of cancer cells are considered from the moment the cells initially change. In contrast, the approach put forward here requires a different way of thinking: we take a longer view and consider cancer as a living entity, with cancer perceived as anomalous rather than abnormal. Third, we theorize the possibility of therapeutic strategies that might involve the redirection (rather than the eradication) of cancer cells. This approach also necessitates new ways of perceiving cancer."
Ethnic Studies	"The rise of global human rights has been presented as compelling evidence for cosmopolitan progress, especially in Europe, with particular benefits for ethnic and religious minorities. New conceptions of citizenship - post-national, de-nationalized, disaggregated and cosmopolitan - have been used to show how minorities have created and profited from European cosmopolitanism. Some theorists have pointed to human rights activism, especially around the foulard affair, to illustrate the arrival of cosmopolitan justice. However, this paper suggests that cosmopolitan optimism has misjudged the magnitude of the impact of human rights. European cosmopolitanism's commitment to cool' attachments has difficulty with thick' religious attachments. Muslim cosmopolitanism - expressed for example though religious pilgrimages - makes Muslims bad' cosmopolitans in the European version. This clash needs to be reconciled before Europe can define itself as the unrivalled source of cosmopolitan justice."
International Relations	"Drawing on the writings of two prominent political thinkers and activists, Jose Marti and Ho Chi Minh, our article foregrounds the imaginative crossings, ethical-political inspirations, and mutual learning among the colonized. Although embedded in different histories, both Marti's and Ho's writings evince an insurgent solidarity with others under colonial enslavement. They evoke conceptions of self-determination and relationality that are strikingly global rather than national or regional. Going beyond affinities of insurgency, we also investigate critical moments of silence and effacement in Marti's and Ho's engagement with subaltern groups. In weaving their anticolonial visions together as well as examining their limitations, we seek to sketch the contours of an alternative, non-Eurocentric international relations."
Area Studies	"The paper studies the differences in attitudes toward the role of the state among the countries and addresses empirically determinants of personal preferences on redistribution and public ownership of firms in Central Asia Countries and Turkey. In the study, we employed the data by World Value Survey (WVS) and European Value Survey (EVS). The comparison at country level indicates that pro-government preferences increase in the most of the countries by the time. Another fact is that the average of individualistic/collectivist attitudes is correlated with the per capita income level of countries. Attitudes favor of redistribution are positively correlated with per capita GDP, while attitudes favor public ownership and government responsibility are negatively correlated with it. Moreover, the homogeneity of citizens' views in a country is positively associated with the country's income level. We analyzed the individual-level determinants of the preferences on redistribution and ownership in Central Asian Countries and Turkey by both the country-level samples and a combined sample of mentioned countries. Results reveal the evidences on significance of income level, subjective wellbeing (happiness and life satisfaction), generalized trust, confidence on government and private sector firms, political views and religiousness in order to determine the preferences on redistribution and ownership, along with demographic characteristics such as gender, age. However, the significance and magnitude of coefficients vary to country sample."
Law	"The late Professor Phillip Areeda's 1990 article ""Essential Facilities: An Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles"" has had a profound impact on the development of the essential facilities doctrine in antitrust law. Although Areeda was not altogether negative about the essential facilities doctrie, his article has proved to be one of the influential pieces in the canon of antitrust literature and represented the beginning of a counterrevolution in antitrust thought that has left the essential facilities doctrine, charitably speaking, hanging by a thread. This Paper critically reexamines Areeda's analysis of the essential facilities doctrine and suggests that while many of his concerns were valid in the time of its publication, most of his concerns are no longer applicable in today's antitrust climate. This Paper suggests that infrastructure theory responds to most, if not all, of Areeda's legitimate critiques and creates a sound theoretical basis for an economically based essential facilities doctrine. Infrastructure theory better ties the essential facilities doctrine to related doctrines in other areas of the law and suggests that essential facilities doctrine is one of better, not worse, ideas that antitrust has offered in its one hundred-plus years."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"The transition to parenthood involves many stressors that can have implications for the couple relationship as well as the developmental environment of the child. Scholars and policymakers have recognized the potential for interventions that can help couples navigate these stressors to improve parenting and coparenting strategies. Such evidence-based programs are scarcely available, however, and little is known about the resources necessary to carry out these programs. This study examines the costs and resources necessary to implement Family Foundations, a program that addresses the multifaceted issues facing first-time parents through a series of pre- and post-natal classes. Costs were determined using a 6-step analytic process and are based on the first implementation of the program carried out through a five-year demonstration project. This assessment demonstrates how overall costs change across years as new cohorts of families are introduced, and how cost breakdowns differ by category as needs shift from training group leaders to sustaining program services. Information from this cost analysis helps clarify how the program could be made more efficient in subsequent implementations. We also consider how results may be used in future research examining economic benefits of participation in the program. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Social Issues	"Charity brands have been found to assist income generation by enhancing donor understanding of an organization and what it stands for. Despite an increasing interest in this topic, few studies have addressed the dimensions of such brands and sought to explore the link (if any) with donor behavior. The authors report the results of a large-scale postal survey of donors to nine national nonprofits and conclude that traits associated with benevolence, progression, and conservatism are incapable of distinguishing between the study's participating brands. Traits associated with emotional engagement, service, voice, and tradition are capable of serving as the basis for differentiation and are also linked to facets of individual giving behavior."
Social Issues	". In January 1985, about 80 Muslim religious scholars and biomedical scientists gathered in a symposium held in Kuwait to discuss the broad question When does human life begin? This article argues that this symposium is one of the milestones in the field of contemporary Islamic bioethics and independent legal reasoning (Ijtihad). The proceedings of the symposium, however, escaped the attention of academic researchers. This article is meant to fill in this research lacuna by analyzing the proceedings of this symposium, the relevant subsequent developments, and finally the interplay of Islam and the West as a significant dimension in these discussions."
Business	"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine American multinational corporations' (MNC's) web site standardization in Poland and the Czech Republic. The theoretical framework was adopted from global marketing strategy (GMS) theory, which focuses on three primary strategies: strategy to create a uniform brand image; strategy to appeal to cross-border segments; and strategy to express culturally bound meaning. To this end, MNCs are posited to pursue the standardization of corporate Visual components and web site functions, and the localization of textual information. Design/methodology/approach - Using web site content analysis techniques, the similarity between the home (US) and host (Polish or Czech) sites is evaluated, and the existence of web site functions in each site is coded. As a secondary reference point, German sites are also examined. Two native coders per country are employed, and the reliability scores are deemed to be satisfactory. Multivariate analyses, including a Multiple discriminant analysis and a multiple correspondence analysis, were applied to test the principal thesis of the study. Findings - The findings suggest that American MNCs tend to apply a high level of Visual components in Polish and Czech sites. However, the level of standardization in textual messages is notably low. Specifically, it appears that the textual information in Polish sites is highly localized despite their uniform visuals, in the same manner as German sites. In addition, MNCs use web site functions in Polish sites to a similar extent to their home US sites, but to a much lesser extent in Czech sites. Originality/value - The findings of this study make an important contribution to the literature, electronic commerce research in this region is extremely scarce. In addition, the theoretical framework, based on GMS theory, appears to be a useful stepping-stone in this area. Along with recent findings in international advertising standardization, this study also provides unique evidence that European integration affects firms' marketing standardization strategy, not only offline, but also in the online marketing environment."
Public Administration	"Third-party service providers often collaborate in both service delivery and administrative advocacy. Yet the linkage between such collaboration has been overlooked. The article studies how joint advocacy inside two government-funded service delivery networks are formed, based on the concepts of service provider clique overlap, multiplexity, and resource tangibility. Comparative network analysis of data from a mental health services network in the US and a community-based elderly care network in China showed consistent support for the linkage between service provider cliques and joint administrative advocacy. Theoretically, it advances the study of advocacy coalitions by highlighting the nuanced effects of service provider cliques on advocacy partnerships."
Education & Educational Research	"Bicultural educational policy is part of a much broader ensemble of bicultural policies that were first developed by the Fourth Labour Government elected in 1984. These policies were an acknowledgement of, and response to, the historical injustices suffered by Maori people as a consequence of colonisation. Bicultural education policy is thought to be a means of addressing the ongoing challenge of educational underachievement of Maori students in the compulsory schooling sector. At present, the dominant discourse in New Zealand education frames the educational underachievement of Maori as a problem associated with cultural differences; however, this tends to obscure explanations that focus on socio-economic disparities.This paper shows how the dominant discourse relating to the underachievement of Maori students is established in policy and maintained through various auditing systems, and how this leaves little space for other explanations or solutions. The paper advocates a move away from an either/or approach to the problem of the educational underachievement of Maori and argues for greater critical engagement with bicultural education policy in order to open up space for conversations that address both the cultural and the socio-economic factors which may affect achievement."
International Relations	"Researchers have seldom focused on the interaction between China's foreign policymakers and its international relations (IR) academia. Since new policies trigger various responses among scholars, it will help us to watch the diversification process within the academic sphere and see the different ideas behind different schools. Furthermore, observing the debates is an interesting way to gain a better understanding of China's foreign policy. By comparing the five key diplomatic transitions since 1979 with the five key debates in IR circles during the same period, this article articulates an interaction model between academia and government based on the consistency of ideas. This article also identifies six possible topics that Chinese IR scholars may debate in the future. It forecasts that the influence of certain minority schools of thought on these issues will grow, because policymakers are gradually changing their fundamental ideas."
Political Science	"In this conclusion, the editors of this symposium provide a concise synthesis and summary of the other contributions. We highlight questions and underscore potential criticisms with an aim to kickstarting some debate. We call for the adoption of a practicably holistic approach to securitization studies and recommend some key elements of this holism, including a focus on failed securitizations, objects, and ethics, to be considered by securitization scholars."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article examines 'the NIDA paradigm', the theory that addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by loss of control over drug taking. I critically review the official history of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA) paradigm and analyze the sources of resistance to it. I argue that, even though the theory remains contested, it has yielded important insights in other fields, including my own discipline of history.

Criminology & Penology	"Some evidence suggests that childhood emotional abuse (CEA) may serve as a risk factor for sexual violence (SV) perpetration; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which CEA may influence SV. This study examined the relationship between CEA and SV by assessing the mediating role of hostility toward women (HTW) in a sample of adjudicated adult males (N = 360). Approximately 1 in 5 participants was classified as sexually violent based on self-reported behavior and/or criminal records. Results indicated that CEA significantly predicted HTW and SV, and HTW significantly predicted SV. As hypothesized, the relationship between CEA and SV was no longer significant after controlling for HTW, supporting the role of HTW as a mediator between CEA and SV. Efforts that aim to prevent CEA or that address early aggressive attitudes or behavior toward women may have a positive impact on preventing or reducing SV."
Women'S Studies	"Bigenderism maintains there are only two genders, which correspond with the two sexes, male and female. Basic bigenderism requires that legal documents and public institutions designate a single invariant gender (that is, sex). Strict bigenderism applies these categories in a social context that stigmatizes ""imperfect"" men and women who do not reach ideals set by the bigenderist schema. I discuss these concepts and their implications, present three models that successively weaken bigenderist assumptions, and argue for the most radical of the three."
Public Administration	"Despite efforts to control fraud in public assistance programs, the perception and realities of the problem persist. Serious barriers related to data collection and research methods impede the understanding of how and why fraud occurs, thereby limiting options for improving program integrity. This article argues that based on a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective, social welfare fraud can be understood as a collective outcome emerging from repeated interactions among stakeholders during the routinized business processes of public assistance programs. While dealing with fraud, great attention must be paid to how it occurs and persists, not just how serious the problem is or who commits these crimes."
History Of Social Sciences	"Focusing on three of the Central and Eastern European countries - Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary - the paper investigates the evolution of spatial planning systems and the introduction of strategic planning practices from the beginning of the post-communist transition in the early 1990s to the present. It sheds new light on this issue by applying the conceptual lens of historical institutionalism to explain this process and elucidate the role of the accession to the European Union (EU) as a catalyst for change. In particular, the paper identifies and analyses the critical junctures at which path dependencies emerged and later constrained the capacity of the regional and local actors to adjust to the EU Cohesion Policy framework and engage in strategic planning as part of it."
Cultural Studies	"The responses to the escape of child murderer Marc Dutroux are on the one hand characterized by bewilderment concerning his horrific actions and on the other hand by relief on his renewed imprisonment. The initial response of bewilderment can be considered an 'interruption' of the process of making meaning: it is a temporary state of inability to give meaning to news reports. With this line of approach, this article emphasizes the temporal dimension of identity constructions. This is of importance to cultural studies, which has paid a lot of attention to spatiality ('spaces of belonging', etc.) but would be better served with more instruments for analysing temporal structures. To understand bewilderment and the temporal dimension of identity construction this article makes use of Kant's and Lyotard's theory on 'the sublime': central to the sublime is the experience of the limits of our ability to comprehend. It will become evident that the responses of bewilderment to Dutroux's escape can best be understood with Kant's modernistic theory of the sublime rather than with Lyotard's postmodernist version. This makes it possible to use theories on the sublime to examine both the modernist versus postmodernist nature of our society, and an important part of the temporal dimension of identity constructions (namely responses to events causing bewilderment). It is appropriate to rename the (Kantian) aesthetic sublime, which has a singular cause, as the cultural sublime: the cultural sublime is the consequence of coherent texts and images, in other words: of media discourses."
Ethics	"Industrial shrimp farming has been promoted by international development and financial institutions in coastal indebted poor countries as a way to obtain foreign exchange earnings, reimburse external debt, and promote development. The promotion of the shrimp industry is a clear example of a more general trend of support of export-oriented primary products, consisting in monocultures of commodities, as opposed to the promotion of more diverse, traditional production directed to feed the local population. In general, it is assumed that export-oriented aquaculture and agriculture, in a framework of liberalization policies, facilitates economic growth and this is associated with poverty reduction and the improvement of food security. However, it has been shown that the promotion of export-oriented production, mostly in the hands of big corporations, can have detrimental consequences for the livelihoods of local populations and the environment. As a result, international institutions, NGOs, and the industry aim to minimize these impacts by promoting sustainable export-oriented production. But some impacts may remain, since the main issue is the primary focus on international deregulated markets and the search for cheap primary products. To illustrate the relationships between the mainstream concept of development, the environmental and social impact of industrial farming systems, and the promotion of export-oriented production in developing countries, this article analyzes the case of the shrimp aquaculture industry."
Environmental Studies	"Artisanal and small-scale mining and quarrying (ASM) contributes significantly to livelihoods, with a huge and undeniable impact on poverty reduction and economic development at all scales. The sector is also known for persistent challenges related to the environment, OHS, labour, migration and conflict. In view of the progress, challenges, and still yet to be realised opportunities, delegates from 72 nations assembled in Livingstone, Zambia, 11-13 September 2018, for the International Conference on Artisanal and Small-scale Mining and Quarrying. This report summarises the proceedings, placing them in historical context. The report includes the full text of the Mosi-Oa-Tunya Declaration on Artisanal and Small-scale Mining, Quarrying and Development. A theme that permeated the sessions was the necessity for miners to be at the heart of any efforts to transform ASM. All stakeholders should recognise the initiative and leadership demonstrated by miners and their representatives; listen to their issues, concerns and suggestions; seek to understand on the ground realities; eliminate language, discourse and behaviour that worsens the stigma associated with ASM; and empower miners to chart their own vision of development. Only with the involvement of miners in governance will the sustainable development challenges associated with ASM be effectively resolved."
Industrial Relations & Labor	This study examines the challenges met by union representatives (URs) who have to reconstruct their traditional role in the context of labour-management partnerships. They are innovators involved in the transition to renewed labour relations. Identity issues and role conflicts are examined through an in-depth analysis of the process involved in assimilating this new role in unionized organizations. The results suggest that URs subordinate the partner role to the interest representation role. Interviews suggest that this enhanced union legitimacy. Some blurring of traditional social categories such as those of employee or employer is possible to the extent that the relations between the actors are founded on interpersonal relations.
Area Studies	"Using quarterly data from 2007 to 2017 from 30 Chinese provinces, this study examines the impact of income correlated to the effect of economic policy uncertainty on insurance purchasing behaviour. The findings reveal that the increase in economic policy uncertainty has a positive effect on insurance purchasing behaviour controlling for the influence of income. Meanwhile, an increase in income weakens the impact of economic policy uncertainty on insurance purchasing behaviour, and income""s negative impact on the effect of economic policy uncertainty on the growth of personal insurance behaviour is significantly greater than that of property insruance. These results once again demonstrate that insurance is an inferior good with decreasing absolute risk aversion."
Environmental Studies	"The government of Zimbabwe launched the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in 2000 as part of its ongoing land reform and resettlement programme which aims to address a racially skewed land distribution. Its goal has been to accelerate both land acquisition and redistribution, targeting at least five million hectares of land for resettlement. This paper investigates the impact of the FTLRP on its beneficiaries' perceptions of land tenure security, and how these subsequently impacted soil conservation investments. Evidence suggests that the programme created some tenure insecurity, which adversely affected soil conservation investments among its beneficiaries. We find support for the contention that households make land-related investments to enhance security of tenure. The results underscore the need for the government of Zimbabwe to clarify and formalize land tenure arrangements within the programme."
Business	"This study examines whether appearance of corporate, product and dual brand names (or a combination of brand names used together) on packaging influence consumer purchase preference. The face-to-face survey consists of consumers rating their purchase preference on a 7-point scale sixteen random brand names, and combinations of brand names on packaging along with three different prices, each for two product categories: chocolate and cereals a total of 4032 observations are examined. Hypotheses are tested using multiple linear regression models. The findings show corporate, product and dual brand names have little impact on purchase preference per se, instead brand category dominance influence consumer choice, and corporate names do not add value as previously thought. The study suggests trends and contexts in which, a corporate name and a product brand name may be extended to optimise consumer brand associations and influence purchase, as well as strategies for extending in remote product categories. Future research needs focusing on international consumers' response on brand linkages in the international arena, and the issues of brand building and brand equity maintenance in international markets. The study makes contribution to brand extension, brand portfolio management and strategic brand management research. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: Bottom-up-based sensory stimulation has been useful in promoting recovery from post-stroke neglect. Light and color are salient stimuli for guiding our orienting behaviors and influence the degree of spatial bias. This study evaluated the effects of lateralized light flash and color on spatial bias in unilateral neglect (UN). Method: We enrolled 15 individuals with UN as a consequence of a right hemispheric stroke of less than 65 d. This was a 3 x 3 design study with three conditions of lens color (colorless, red, and blue) and three conditions of flash light locations (no flash, left, and right). Results: All participants showed a decrease in ipsilesional spatial bias under left-side light flash and a red lens. Right-side light flash and a blue lens induced more rightward bias than other conditions. Conclusions: This evidence confirms the use of sensory stimulation to complement post-stroke UN remediation. Lateralized light flash to the contralesional space and red-colored lenses have beneficial effects on amelioration of UN, whereas ipsilesional light flash and the color blue may exacerbate ipsilesional spatial bias in stroke survivors with UN."
Gerontology	"Objectives To identify the domains of health-related characteristics of older hospitalized adults and nursing home residents most strongly associated with short-term mortality. Design Systematic review. Setting Studies published in English in MEDLINE, Scopus, or Web of Science before August 1, 2010. Participants Prospective studies consisting of persons aged 65 and older that evaluated the association between at least one health-related participant characteristic and mortality within a year in multivariable analysis. Measurements All health-related characteristics associated with mortality in multivariable analysis were extracted and categorized into domains. The frequency, with all studies combined, with which particular domains were associated with mortality in multivariable analysis was determined. Results Thirty-three studies (28 in hospitalized individuals, five in nursing home residents) reported a large number of characteristics associated with mortality that could be categorized in seven domains: cognitive function, disease diagnosis, laboratory values, nutrition, physical function, pressure ulcers, and shortness of breath. Measures of physical function and nutrition were the domains most frequently associated with mortality up to 1year from the time of evaluation for hospitalized individuals and nursing home residents; measures of physical function, cognitive function, and nutrition were the domains most frequently associated with in-hospital mortality for hospitalized individuals. Conclusion Of a large number of health-related characteristics of older persons shown to be associated with short-term mortality, measures of nutrition, physical function, and cognitive function were the domains of health most frequently associated with mortality. These domains provide easily measurable factors that may serve as helpful markers for individuals at high mortality risk."
Substance Abuse	"Objective: The study evaluated the timing and dosage of a parent-based intervention to minimize alcohol consumption for students with varying drinking histories. Method: First-year students (N = 1,900) completed Web assessments during the summer before college (baseline) and two follow-ups (fall of first and second years). Students were randomized to one of four conditions (pre-college matriculation [PCM], pre-college matriculation plus boosters [PCM+B], after college matriculation [ACM], and control conditions). Seven indicators of drinking (drink in past month, been drunk in past month, weekday [Sunday to Wednesday] drinking, Thursday drinking, weekend [Friday, Saturday] drinking, heavy episodic drinking in past 2 weeks, and peak blood alcohol concentration <.08) were used in a latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine a stage-sequential model of drinking. LTA models with dummy-coded intervention variables were used to examine the effects of the intervention conditions on changes in drinking patterns. Results: Results indicated that four patterns of drinking were present at all waves: (a) nondrinkers, (b) weekend light drinkers, (c) weekend heavy episodic drinkers, and (d) heavy drinkers. Results indicated that the PCM condition was most effective at influencing baseline heavy drinkers' transition out of this pattern to lower risk patterns at first follow-up, whereas the ACM condition was not effective at preventing drinking escalation for baseline nondrinkers at first follow-up. No decay of effects was observed at long-term follow-up for the PCM condition. Finally, the results also indicated that increased dosage of the parental intervention was not significantly associated with either reduction or escalation of use. Conclusions: The results underscore the value of pre-college parental interventions and targeted efforts to reduce high-risk drinking among college students. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 74, 30-40, 2013)"
Demography	"This article empirically investigates whether emigrants from MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries self-select along two cultural traits: religiosity and gender-egalitarian attitudes. Using Gallup World Poll data on individual opinions and beliefs and migration aspirations, we find that individuals who intend to emigrate to high-income countries exhibit significantly lower levels of religiosity than the rest of the population. They also share more gender-egalitarian views, although this effect holds only among the young (aged 15 to 30), among single women, and in countries with a Sunni minority. For countries most affected by the Arab Spring, the intensity of cultural selection has decreased since 2011. Still, the aggregate effects of cultural selection should not be overestimated. Self-selection along cultural traits has statistically significant but limited effects on the cultural distance between people (i.e., between migrants and natives at destination or between non-migrants in origin and destination countries). Emigration could even reverse the selection effect and lead to cultural convergence if migrants abroad transfer more progressive norms and beliefs to their home country, a mechanism that deserves more attention in future research."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"The Wallenius distribution is a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution where weights are assigned to balls of different colours. This naturally defines a model for ranking categories which can be used for classification. Since, in general, the resulting likelihood is not analytically available, we adopt an approximate Bayesian computational approach for estimating the importance of the categories. We illustrate the performance of the estimation procedure on simulated data sets. Finally, we use the new model for analysing two data sets concerning movie ratings and Italian academic statisticians' journal preferences. The latter is a novel data set collected by the authors."
Substance Abuse	"This study investigates the association between drug use and lifetime suicidal behaviors among Asian American women (n = 720) residing throughout Massachusetts, using data collected from 2010 to 2011. Logistic regression models identified that a history of hard drug use alone or in combination with soft drug use has a significant association with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Asian American women, adjusting for demographic covariates, history of psychiatric diagnosis, and family communication. These findings highlight the importance of addressing hard drug use when designing suicide prevention programs for Asian American women."
International Relations	"In this article, I explore media representations in a UK-owned online news outlet of the North Korean situation, drawing on the work of Michel Foucault and Stuart Hall as a means of analyzing the discursive formations through which representations of state criminality, associated victimization, and normative transgressions are presented to the audience. I argue that the strategy of encoding the discourse leads to the emptying out of cultural and historical contexts. In many cases, reports ""refill"" this void with appeals to lifeworld interpretations that resonate more with audiences' historical consciousness than depict the reality of North Korea. I conclude by suggesting that ""emptied"" reports may serve the function of creating a sense of ontological security that conditions audiences' decoding of the media texts."
Sociology	"This study examined the use of nonhuman primate actors (PAs) in promotional trailers for wide-release, English-language CARA-rated films released between 1990 and 2013. A comprehensive list of films featuring PAs was constructed using internet databases and snowball sampling. Changes in the frequency of their use over time were examined. Trailers for each of the films on the list were screened for inclusion of PA footage. Those including PAs were content-analyzed for a list of items including taxa/taxon used; presence or absence of bared-teeth display (BTD, often an expression of fear or submission in nonhuman primates); and presence of clothing, human companion, anthropogenic environment, and/or human actions. No statistically significant increase or decrease in the frequency of PA use was detected over the time period examined, although comparison to an earlier study that included pre-1990 films suggests that the use of orangutans (Pongo spp.) has diminished in frequency. The present study found that the most commonly used taxa between 1990 and 2013 were chimpanzees (Pan spp.), capuchins (Cebus and Sapajus spp.), and Cercopithecines (Macaca and Papio spp.). PAs were shown grinning (displaying BTDs) for 19% of the time they were onscreen; they were clothed 50% of the time; performing human actions 58% of the time; alongside human companions 87% of the time and/or in anthropogenic environments 87% of the time. Apart from concern that the practice compromises the welfare of individual primates, there is some indication that the use of PAs may be indirectly harmful as well; results of several recent studies suggest that their presentation in certain contexts fosters false public understanding about the conservation status of primates and their suitability as human companions or pets. The low but steady frequency with which PAs were used and presented in various anthropocentric contexts suggests that, throughout the time period studied, the film industry remained either uninformed or unconcerned about the potential harmful effects that their choices could have on animal welfare and conservation."
Ethnic Studies	"The concept of community cohesion is the centrepiece of the policy that was formulated by the British government in response to the urban disturbances in northern English towns during 2001. A number of official reports identified lack of community cohesion as the critical factor. The central argument for community cohesion, the self-segregation thesis, was based on evidence from Bradford. The core idea, parallel lives, was first articulated in the Ouseley Report and incorporated into the Cantle Report and subsequent government reports into the 2001 disturbances. The Commission for Integration and Cohesion widened the concept of community cohesion, which encompassed faith and ethnic groups, to include income and generation, suggesting that the concept was more complex than earlier definitions allowed. However, the increasing concern with terrorism has meant that Muslims remain the focus of debates on cohesion, and a conflation of the community cohesion programme with the government's anti-terrorism strategy is evident in the policy literature. Samad's article is based on research carried out in Bradford to unearth and explore the factors that enhance or undermine community cohesion in those areas where there are established Muslim communities and, additionally, those in which Muslim migrants have recently arrived. It scrutinizes the debate on a number of issues: the difficulties in defining and implementing community cohesion policy, and the issues of segregation, social capital, transnationalism and belonging. This data-driven analysis takes the main areas of debate and tests them with evidence from Bradford. The research findings challenge some of the fundamental assumptions that have informed government policy by providing new evidence that throws light on central aspects of the debate. The need to reflect on these assumptions became more relevant after the English riots of 2011, centred in London, and the subsequent necessity to develop an effective strategy that engages with their root causes."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Objective.To determine the frequency of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the first fifty years of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico Manuel Velasco Suarez (Institute Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia de Mexico, INNN) from 1965 to 2014. Materials and methods. A total of 16 116 institutional records of CNS tumors were analyzed. The frequency and distribution of CNS tumors were evaluated by tumor type, patient age and patient gender.The annual relationship between CNS tumors and surgical discharges (SD) over the last 20 years was estimated. Results. The frequencies of most CNS tumors were consistent with those found worldwide, and the most common tumors were neuroepithelial tumors (33%), particularly astrocytic tumors (67%); meningeal tumors (26%); and pituitary tumors (20%).The incidence of pituitary tumors in these data was twice as high as that reported in other regions of the world, and the relationship between CNS tumors and SD was consistent over time (0.22-0.39). Conclusion. This study summarizes the largest sample of CNS tumor cases analyzed in Mexico and provides an important reference of the frequency of this tumor type in the country.This work will serve as a basis for conducting studies evaluating factors associated with the presence of CNS tumors and for identifying adequate public health interventions."
Gerontology	"ObjectiveTo describe the clinical presentation and temporal variation in ambulance service cases involving patients aged 65 years or older (older adults) from residential aged care facilities and those who are community dwelling (CD). MethodsThis study used four years of electronic case records from Ambulance Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. Trigonometric regression was used to analyse demand patterns. ResultsResidential aged care facility cases included proportionally more falls and infection-related problems and fewer circulatory-related incidents than CD cases. Community dwelling demand patterns differed between weekdays and weekends and peaked late morning. Residential aged care facility cases peaked late morning, with a secondary peak early evening, but with no significant difference between days. ConclusionsOlder adult ambulance demand has distinct temporal patterns that differ by place of residence and are associated with different clinical presentations. These results provide a basis for informing ambulance planning and the identification of alternate health services."
"Business, Finance"	"This paper investigates the impact of CEOs' career experiences on corporate investment decisions. We hypothesize that CEOs with more diverse career experiences are less likely to be constrained by insufficient internal capital. The potential mechanism is that rich external experiences help CEOs accumulate social connections and these connections mitigate information asymmetry and lead to better access to external funds. Consistent with this argument, we find that firms with CEOs who have more diverse career experiences exhibit lower investment-cash flow sensitivity and exploit more outside funds, including both bank loans and trade credit. These effects are more pronounced among financially constrained firms. Even controlling for connections gained through financial institutions or government offices, the effect of diversity still remains very strong. Finally, we conduct several tests to mitigate the concern that our results are driven by the endogeneity of CEOs' appointments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Ethics	"In follow-up to a large-scale ethics survey of neuroscientists whose research involves neuroimaging, brain stimulation and imaging genetics, we conducted focus groups and interviews to explore their sense of responsibility about integrating ethics into neuroimaging and readiness to adopt new ethics strategies as part of their research. Safety, trust and virtue were key motivators for incorporating ethics into neuroimaging research. Managing incidental findings emerged as a predominant daily challenge for faculty, while student reports focused on the malleability of neuroimaging data and scientific integrity. The most frequently cited barrier was time and administrative burden associated with the ethics review process. Lack of scholarly training in ethics also emerged as a major barrier. Participants constructively offered remedies to these challenges: development and dissemination of best practices and standardized ethics review for minimally invasive neuroimaging protocols. Students in particular, urged changes to curricula to include early, focused training in ethics."
Transportation	"The optimal location of ambulances in a geographic region is interrelated with how the ambulances are dispatched to patients. Papers in the literature often treat the location and dispatching of ambulance separately. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that determines how to locate and dispatch ambulances through district design. The model allows for uncertainty in both ambulance travel times and ambulance availability, and it maximizes the coverage level, i.e., the fraction of high-priority calls that can be responded to within a fixed-time threshold. The proposed MILP model determines the stations where ambulances should be located and assigns each call location to the open ambulance stations according to a preference list. The preference list is a rank ordering of the ambulances to assign to patients at a call location, from the most to the least preferred. The preference lists partition the region into a series of response districts that depend on ambulance availability, and the model balances the workload among the servers and maintains contiguity in the first priority response districts. The underlying ambulance queuing dynamics introduce nonlinearities to the model. To maintain a linear model, we use a Hypercube approximation model to estimate several of the inputs, and we provide an iterative algorithm to update the input parameters and solve the resulting MILP model. A computational example illustrates the modeling paradigm and solution algorithm using a real-world example. The results suggest that the reduction in coverage to maintain contiguity and balanced workloads among the ambulances is small."
Sociology	"This study examines discrimination of Arabic-named applicants in online recruitment procedures in the Netherlands. We develop and implement a new field experiment approach, posting fictitious resumes (n = 636) on two online resume databases. Two phases of recruitment procedures are examined: employers' decisions to (1) view applicants' complete resumes after seeing short profiles and (2) contact applicants. The experiment covers both male and female applicants, three occupational levels, five sectors, and ten geographical regions, and consists of two waves. Results provide strong evidence of discrimination in the first phase (views). Resumes of Arabic-named applicants were requested less often, regardless of their education, gender, age, region, or sector, and for both websites and waves. Controlling for the number of times candidates' full resumes were viewed, there is less evidence of discrimination in the second phase (reactions). Yet, after two phases, the cumulative ethnic difference is considerable: Dutch-named applicants are 60 percent more likely to receive a positive reaction than Arabic-named applicants. We conclude that ethnic disparities in outcomes of recruitment procedures are substantial and arise already in the very first phase of the selection process. Hence, employers often do not even get to see Arabic-named applicants' resumes. Finally, discrimination is stronger in wave two, when the total number of views of resumes was lower, indicating lower labor demand."
Sociology	"The paper discusses general condition and main features of modernization in the Far Eastern Federal District, its pace and types of dynamics, basing on the analysis of Russian Federal State Statistics Service data and indices calculated by the Center for Study of Sociocultural Change (CSSC) of the Institute of Philosophy, RAS. Special attention is paid to socioeconomic and socio-cultural components of modernization through analysis of the data of social research available for this macro-region. The study is performed in accordance with methodology of the research project of the CSSC, ""Social and cultural modernization and consolidation of regional communities"" (project's director is RAS corresponding member N.I. Lapin)."
Environmental Studies	"Agroforestry is an integrated land use management that combines a woody component with a lower story agricultural production recognized as one of the most important tools to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The objective of this paper is to provide a categorization and extent of agroforestry practices linked to agricultural and forest lands at regional level and evaluate how are they promoted by the previous (2007-2013) and current CAP (2014-2020) with a special focus on climate change mitigation potential. Agroforestry occupies almost 20 million hectares in Europe, being silvopasture and homegardens the most extensively spread practices and forest farming not quantified. Agroforestry practices are promoted at European level but in a really complex form as more than 25 measures are implemented to enhance the existing 5 agroforestry practices (silvopasture, silvoarable, riparian buffer strips, forest farming and homegardens). Simplification of the number of measures to promote agroforestry practices is needed to better follow up the implementation and to evaluate and provide future policies more adapted at European levels. Huge potential climate change mitigation options should be focused on the use of silvopasture on forest lands to reduce forest fires and to increase the presence of the woody component on arable lands (silvoarable) but also on the promotion of forest farming and homegardens as forms to increase the use of short supply chains and to increase the connection of urban, periurban and rural areas within a bioeconomy and circular economy framework."
Political Science	"In this paper I investigate the dynamic relationship between formal education and voter turnout over the past half century. I reframe Brody's puzzle about why rising education levels did not produce higher voter turnout using The American Voter's ""funnel of causality"" to allow for a dynamic relationship between education and turnout. Analyzing survey data from 1952 to 2004, I show that the effect of college education increased starting in 1980s, thereby magnifying the ability of educational attainment to predict turnout. In contrast, education had a constant effect on political knowledge, another common measure of civic engagement. I conclude by evaluating several explanations for these divergent results.

Development Studies	"Increasingly, value chain approaches are integrated with multi-stakeholder processes to facilitate inclusive innovation and value chain upgrading of smallholders. This pathway to smallholder integration into agri-food markets has received limited analysis. This article analyses this integration through a case study of an ongoing smallholder dairy development programme in Tanzania. Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e.g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Medically unexplained symptoms are a source of frustration for clinician and patient alike. They simultaneously test the credibility of the doctor and the patient; the former, for his or her inability to label the patient's complaint, and the latter, for the ignominy of being perceived to have a factitious symptom. This review explores the discursive construction of such symptoms in the medical literature in order to appreciate the context in which medicine understands and manages non-diagnosed complaints. It uses medically unexplained symptoms as a heuristic for understanding the role of classification in constituting medicine as a social authority. In the absence of diagnostic category, medically unexplained symptoms are recast as a discrete category of their own. However, this category implies the infallibility of the physician and the relevance of the medical model in all circumstances. It transfers responsibility for the disorder to the patient in a way that may hinder resolution, and it ignores socio-historical practices that influence when and why patients consult a physician.

Ethnic Studies	"This article uses a research framework based in critical race methodology to analyze and emplot narrative and counternarrative themes in public discourse around education reform in New Orleans. It examines narratives from research literature, popular media, and teacher recruitment materials, including the theme of the open-access charter school system as an innovative solution to the failures of pre-Katrina neighborhood schools. It finally argues for the necessity of counternarratives grounded in the testimonies and lived experiences of parents, teachers and students navigating and surviving within a rapidly evolving pedagogical landscape."
History	"The press has, from time to time, reported on the occurrence of episodes of witchcraft-related violence in the northeast of South Africa. Social analysts often attribute witchcraft beliefs and accusations to the persistence of 'traditional' beliefs in the contemporary world. This article challenges such interpretations and asks whether it is possible to see witchcraft beliefs and accusations as a product of people's exposure to the South African system of Native Reserves and bantustans. Drawing on multi-temporal fieldwork in Bushbuckridge, a district of the South African lowveld, I endeavour to show how witchcraft beliefs have been structured by the historical processes of population relocation, the implementation of agricultural betterment schemes, labour migration, and by ideologies of cultural difference, that were central to the bantustan system. At the local level, I suggest that accusations have been fuelled by experiences of social confinement in 'closed' communities, relative deprivation and of competition for scarce resources."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	. This study investigates whether and to what extent further unemployment experience for youths who are already long term unemployed imposes a penalty on subsequent labour market outcomes. We propose a flexible method for analysing the effect on wages aside from transitions from unemployment and employment within a multivariate duration model which controls for selection on observables and unobservables. We find that prolonging unemployment drastically decreases the chances of finding employment but hardly affects the quality of subsequent employment. The analysis suggests that negative duration dependence in the job finding rate is induced by negative signalling and not by human capital depreciation.
Rehabilitation	"Method. Ninety-six patients with symptomatic LSS underwent decompressive surgery. Data were collected with self-report questionnaires before surgery and 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively. Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Depressive burden was examined by compiling the sum of preoperative, 3-month and 6-month BDI scores. Physical functioning and pain were assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index, Walking ability and VAS. In the analyses, the subjects were divided into two groups according to the median age (62 years). Results. Depressive burden was a strong predictor of disability at the 2-year postoperative phase both in younger and elderly patients with LSS. A notable proportion (20%) of the younger patients had considerable depressive symptomatology 2 years after the surgery, whereas in the older age group this proportion was 8%. Conclusion. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship between depressive symptoms and disability among postoperative patients with LSS. Identifying and treating patients with preoperative and postoperative depressive symptoms may be a useful strategy for improving LSS surgery outcomes."
Ethics	"Here, I investigate the challenges involved in addressing ethical questions related to food policy, food security, and climate change in a public engagement atmosphere where ""experts"" (e.g., scientists and scholars), policy-makers and laypersons interact. My focus is on the intersection between food and climate in the state of Alaska, located in the circumpolar north. The intersection of food security and climate represents a ""wicked problem."" This wicked problem is plagued by ""unruliness,"" characterized by disruptive mechanisms that can impede how ethical issues in policy-making are broached. Unruliness is exacerbated by conditions of engagement that can be characterized as occurring in a ""fog."" In this fog, interlocutors encounter both moral and epistemological conundrums. In considering how to mitigate unruliness, a bottom-up approach is recommended. I discuss ""taming"" strategies for addressing these ethical concerns; modest suggestions on what should be taken into count when confronting issues of science and ethics within the context of promoting greater deliberative discourse regarding food security issues at more local levels. My recommendations are made in light of developments in food policy in Alaska and may be instructive for other regions pursuing cold climate agricultural expansion, for example."
Anthropology	"In this essay, I explore the micropolitics of citizenship and sovereignty via the emerging street bureaucratic status of ""white"" German women in relationships with ""black"" men in Germany and Berlin. In the midst of the fallen Berlin Wall and increasing Europe-wide restrictions on immigration and asylum, it examines further the extent to which a consistent ""black"" male hypersexual performance is necessary for legal recognition via ""white"" German women who, taking on an informal bureaucratic status, ultimately decide which ""black"" subjects to marry. A history of desiring ""black"" bodies, the essay argues, coincides with several important moments of sexual liberation (incl. post-World War II African American military occupation, 1970s West German feminism, and the fall of the Berlin Wall), which make these relationships both possible and public; however, the hypersexualized conditions under which ""black"" subjects get incorporated into contemporary German life are also ultimately exclusionary."
Ethnic Studies	"From the time of his nomination as the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential candidate onwards, Barack Obama was the target of a panoply of political attacks. Conservatives, Republicans and even some Democrats played on his alterity in a way that previous non-white political hopefuls, particularly the Reverend Jesse Jackson, had not had to endure. If the intricate twists and turns of Obama's past did not make those attacks particularly surprising, the way in which he chose to deal with them was. In what stands as a deliberate pre-emptive attack, Obama used two substantive texts, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, to create and shape a historical narrative of his own past in such a way as to present himself to the US voting public as a truly American figure, worthy of the presidency. By the time he was running for high office, therefore, Obama had already used his knowledge of the discipline of history to create a usable past with which he and his supporters could denude many of those political attacks of their potency, whether they were focused on the years of his upbringing in an Islamic state, his familial ties to Kenya, his religious background or his purported links to radicalism."
Geography	"The evolution of alluvial fans on the narrow coastal plain of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile is so far poorly investigated. Therefore, a detailed geomorphological map at a scale of 1:7500 of a coastal alluvial fan complex at Guanillos (21 degrees 58 ' S, 70 degrees 10.5 ' W) is provided as a first step to understand the fan's morphogenesis. Geomorphological mapping was based on a digital elevation model with a resolution of 2 m generated from Pleiades-1 tri-stereo satellite imagery, derived terrain parameters, and on-site field mapping. The resultant map is used to characterize and categorize the overall morphology of the alluvial fan complex. In particular, linear features constructed by primary alluvial fan processes can be differentiated successfully from those developed by secondary processes. Furthermore, the advanced evolutionary state of the fan complex is revealed. We introduce a morphostratigraphic model comprising the fan's prograde evolution, dissection, and successive abandonment of surface generations."
Area Studies	"The level or rank of an administrative division in China-a structural condition of the sub-national territorial administrative system-is a correlate of administrative rank. State reterritorialization of the administrative divisions, through establishment and expansion of hundreds of cities, introduces a political economy of differentiation and change by which city governments take the measure of their administrative reach and economic capacity. How do changes to the administrative divisions involve administrative rank, economic status and territorial governing power? In Suzhou, a prefecture-level city, incommensurability between the economic status of the city and its administrative rank reveals how 'unfair' rank in the administrative hierarchy becomes implicated in negotiations over territorial adjustments and cadre appointments, leading to creative forms of rank adjustment. Dynamics of the administrative divisions reflect rank consciousness, influence official positions and structure urban transformation in contemporary China."
Substance Abuse	"Background and Objectives: Assessing motivation to quit substance use is recommended as part of brief interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine correlates of desire to quit marijuana use among young adult women enrolled in a brief motivational intervention trial. Methods: Participants were 332 female marijuana users, aged 18-24, who rated their current desire to quit using a single item change ladder. We hypothesized self-efficacy and prior quit attempts will interact in this population to increase motivation to quit. Results: Participants had a mean age of 20.5 years, 67.7% were non-Hispanic Caucasian, and 60% had some desire to quit marijuana use. Using multivariate linear regression, quit desire was significantly lower among Caucasians (b = -.256; 95% CI = .489; =.037) and more frequent marijuana users (b =.268; 95% CI =.372; =.166), and higher among those with previous quit attempts (b = .454; 95% CI = .235;.671), and greater marijuana problem severity (b.408; 95% CI = .302; .514). Greater refusal self-efficacy was associated with greater quit desire among participants with previous quit attempts, but not among those without prior quit attempts (b = .241; 95% CI .050; .440). Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Understanding the factors relating to quit desire among marijuana users may allow clinicians to tailor counseling so as to increase readiness to quit and decrease use and its associated consequences."
Women'S Studies	"This article focuses on the contradictions that exist between economic development and gender equity in India. It deploys concepts of cultural violence and symbolic hegemony to understand how gender and caste-based violence is normalized and institutionalized over time through cultural norms. It also uses an intersectional lens to examine the layers of marginalization and oppression. Based on field studies in rural Bihar, it shows that despite development gains, old forms of gender-based discrimination and violence such as son-preference, dowry, witch-hunting, and discriminatory practices associated with menstruation persist. It notes that there are new forms of violence used by the upper caste groups against the lower ones when the latter resist and refuse to continue performing traditional caste-based tasks. We argue that this refusal by lower caste women can be seen as symbolic resistance against historically defined norms of caste. The emerging patterns of violence discussed in the paper need a more concerted and nuanced exploration of reconfigurations of relations within and between caste groups, as well as the cultural and social contexts in which changes are taking place."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Measures of period-to-period change are key statistics for many economy surveys. To improve the precision of these estimates of change, the majority of the business surveys at Statistics Sweden select stratified simple random samples (STSI) at different points in time, ensuring positive correlation between samples (overlapping samples) by using permanent random numbers (PRN). Statistics Sweden normally selects positively coordinated STSIs drawn from an updated Business Register (BR). In these samples, the industry strata are usually stratified further within industry into size strata. When the most recent sampling frame contains updated classification variables for all units, enterprises can change stratum between two sampling occasions. A drawback of the coordinated sample selection procedure is that the desired correlation between the two samples decreases if the proportion of enterprises that change strata is substantial. Consequently, the sample design must anticipate the potential effect of stratum changes between samples. This article presents a study that examines how the design of a repeated business survey affects the precision in estimates of change over time using the Turnover in the Service Sector survey conducted by Statistics Sweden as an example."
Urban Studies	"This paper examines the spatial patterns of non-work activities for 34 drivers in the Southeast Michigan region. Capitalizing upon a unique global positioning systems (GPS) dataset and GIS visualization techniques, this study quantifies the spatial distributions of non-work activities for drivers with different commuting distances, and for non-work activities that are chained in different types of travel (commute travel vs. non-commute travel). We find a strong dependence of non-work activity locations on commuting distances, and an influence of commuting routes on non-work activities chained in all types of travel. The results underline the importance of commuting routes in shaping the spatial configuration of non-work activities."
Substance Abuse	"Objective: Research in Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) training indicates that such training can prevent over-service of alcohol and reduce drunk driving. However, reviews of the RBS literature suggest that the quality of training methods and the stability of implementation are important factors in determining RBS training effectiveness. Most RBS classes have been taught live, where the quality of instruction varies across instructors and classes, and the stability of the implementation of an RBS curriculum is variable. Web-based RBS training may carry important advantages by stabilizing instruction and implementation factors. Randomized trial results of a web-based onsite RBS training program (WayToServe (R) [WTS]) are reported here. It was hypothesized that servers trained by WTS would refuse alcohol service at significantly higher rates compared with Usual and Customary (UC) live training. Method: On-site alcohol-serving establishments in New Mexico communities were randomized to receive WTS training (n = 154) or the Usual and Customary live RBS training (n = 155). Premises were assessed at baseline, immediate post-training, 6-months post-training, and 1-year post-training intervals. Pseudo-intoxicated patron protocols were used to assess premise alcohol service during the early to mid-evening hours of 6:30 P.M. to 8:30 P.M., with the percentage of alcohol service refusals to apparently intoxicated pseudo-patrons as the primary outcome variable. Results: Results indicate significantly higher refusal rates for WTS than for UC premises at the immediate (WTS = 68% vs. UC = 49%) and the 1-year post-training assessment points (WTS = 68% vs. UC = 58%) but not at the 6-month post-training assessment (WTS = 69% vs. UC=64%). Differences in refusal rates based on pseudo-patron age were observed Where younger pseudo-patrons were consistently refused more often than older pseudo-patrons. Conclusions: Effective RBS training can be delivered online, making it a potentially cost-effective way of reaching large alcohol server populations."
Demography	"Among the challenges faced by Latin America at the onset of the 21st century is the increase in crime and violence that began in the mid-1980s, and which, to one degree or another, has afflicted most countries in the region. In this study we explore the potential implications of the upsurge in crime on migration by testing the hypothesis that crime victimization in Latin America increases the probability that people have given serious thought to the prospect of migrating with their families to the United States. Using Latinobarometro public opinion surveys of approximately 49,000 respondents residing in 17 countries in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the results of a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model found that, net of individual and country-level control variables, the probability of seriously considering family migration to the United States was around 30 percent higher among respondents who reported that they or a member of their family was a victim of a crime sometime during the year prior to the survey. Evidence that victimization promotes the propensity to emigrate is a finding that contributes to an understanding of the transnational consequences of the increase in crime in Latin America, and adds a new variable to the inventory of factors that encourage people to migrate to the United States."
Anthropology	"The role of Panlongcheng-a walled settlement on the Yangtze River with obvious links to the Erligang capital at Zhengzhou, 500 km to the north-in early Bronze Age China has been the subject of much debate. Panlongcheng is a typical Erligang site ( 1500-1300 BC), with evidence for people of elite status, unlike any other site apart from Zhengzhou itself. The tombs and bronzes at Panlongcheng, as well as other materials, closely resemble those at Zhengzhou. Why was Panlongcheng established along the Yangtze River, and what were the Erligang elites doing there? Considering the rich copper deposits in this area, it is widely assumed that the major function of Panlongcheng was to ship metal to Zhengzhou, and in return to receive bronze vessels from Zhengzhou. The purpose of this paper is to revisit this discussion through a re-evaluation of the scientific data on the bronzes from each site. A series of differences and similarities in the chemical and isotopic compositions of the metal objects at Panlongcheng and Zhengzhou are identified, suggesting that the relationship was more complex than was previously thought. In this light, despite a close social and presumably political affiliation with Zhengzhou, Panlongcheng appears likely to have had its own metal-casting capability, rather than having to rely completely on finished objects imported from Zhengzhou. This discovery encourages scholars to re-consider the metal supply network and the underlying political landscape in early dynastic China, shifting from a linear model to a complex but probably more realistic one."
Transportation	"This study analyzes, from an experiential marketing perspective, the showcasing of duty-free products onboard the A380 aircraft, a service area that Korean Air introduced for the first time in the industry. Through the analysis the study seeks to identify the effects that customers' experience of the duty free showcase area has on their emotional response, impulse buying intention and word-of-mouth intention. For this testing, structural equation modeling was applied to data collected from passengers who had used the duty free exhibition space on Korean Air's A380. The results revealed that FEEL and ACT marketing experience in the duty free area were each found to have a positive effect on emotional response, and this factor was found to have a positive effect on impulse buying intention and word-of-mouth intention.

Health Policy & Services	"Background: There is limited information on patients' knowledge about their cost-sharing requirements and how that influenced their care-seeking behavior. Objective: To examine patients' knowledge of their office visit copayments, their self-reported responses to perceived and actual copayments, and discussions with physicians about costs. Research Design: Cross-sectional telephone inter-view study with a 71% response rate. Subjects: Stratified random sample of 479 adult members of a prepaid, integrated delivery system: equal sample of members with and without a chronic disease. Measures: Perceived and actual office visit copayment amounts, patient self-reported behavioral responses to copayments, cost discussions with a physician, and patient attitudes about discussing costs. Results: Overall, 50% of respondents correctly reported their copayment amount, with 39% underestimating and 11% overestimating. Among respondents who reported having copayments, 27% reported delaying or avoiding a visit altogether, or talking to a physician/advice nurse instead of attending an in-person visit because of their copayment. Perceived office visit copayment amounts were significantly associated with self-reported behavior changes (OR, 1.47 per $10; 95% CI, 1.06-2.05). Only 4% of respondents reported talking with their physician about their costs, with 79% believing that their providers cannot help them with their costs, and 51% believing that it is inappropriate to discuss costs with their physician. Conclusions: Patients have limited knowledge of their office visit copayment amounts, and are changing their care-seeking behavior in response to perceived costs. Moreover, most patients are making these changes without discussing their cost concerns with their physician."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Gender violence in Spanish universities remains a taboo that is in the process of transformation. The first research on this issue was conducted between 2005 and 2008. The main objective was to ""break the silence"" about violence against women in Spanish academia. To achieve this aim, data collection was conducted through mixed communicative methods. For the interviewees, the context created by this research made it possible for the first time to establish a space to speak openly about this problem, in contrast to the existing context in which aggressors have remained unpunished. The inclusion of students' voices together with those of administrative staff and professors allowed for the identification of situations of gender violence. This research has had a significant impact on Spanish universities' policies. Despite some institutional barriers that make the implementation of structural changes more difficult, many offices for equality and protocols against gender violence have been created."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"In structural equation modeling software, either limited-information (bivariate proportions) or full-information item parameter estimation routines could be used for the 2-parameter item response theory (IRT) model. Limited-information methods assume the continuous variable underlying an item response is normally distributed. For skewed and platykurtic latent variable distributions, 3 methods were compared in Mplus: limited information, full information integrating over a normal distribution, and full information integrating over the known underlying distribution. Interfactor correlation estimates were similar for all 3 estimation methods. For the platykurtic distribution, estimation method made little difference for the item parameter estimates. When the latent variable was negatively skewed, for the most discriminating easy or difficult items, limited-information estimates of both parameters were considerably biased. Full-information estimates obtained by marginalizing over a normal distribution were some what biased. Full-information estimates obtained by integrating over the true latent distribution were essentially unbiased. For the a parameters, standard errors were larger for the limited-information estimates when the bias was positive but smaller when the bias was negative. For the d parameters, standard errors were larger for the limited-information estimates of the easiest, most discriminating items. Otherwise, they were generally similar for the limited-and full-information estimates. Sample size did not substantially impact the differences between the estimation methods; limited information did not gain an advantage for smaller samples."
Communication	"Queen Elizabeth's visit to the Irish Republic in May 2011 was seen by many as a significant moment in the long process of normalisation in Anglo-Irish relations, facilitated by the peace process in Northern Ireland. For journalists, it was a newsworthy story because it captured the values of this process of peace-making in a concrete, organised media event, involving high-profile heads of state, official speeches and photo opportunities. This article examines the representation of this state visit in British and in Irish daily newspapers, and finds similar coverage across a number of shared themes. Journalists in both countries supported the conciliatory message embedded in the media event, with very little questioning, and marginalised voices of opposition. This approach contributed to an ideological consensus that the conflict between the two countries was in the past, with conciliation and collaboration the only future."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"M.H. Pappworth's 1967 book, Human guinea pigs, was a major catalyst for change in the ethics and regulation of human research in the 1970s. Many of Pappworth's ethical concerns about the threats posed to human subjects are still valid today, yet the source of those threats has shifted from universities to industry sponsors."
"Education, Special"	"For students to be successful in higher education, they need not only have motivation and sufficient intellectual ability, but also a wide range of study skills as well as the metacognitive ability to determine when a change in strategy is needed. We examined whether first-year undergraduates with dyslexia (N = 100) differ from peers without learning disabilities (N = 100) in the use of study strategies. The Learning and Study Strategies Inventory was used and potential gender differences were investigated. Matched for age, gender and field of study, fluid intelligence scores were comparable between groups. The self-reports showed that knowledge of test taking strategies was more limited in the dyslexic group. Also, 'fear of failure' was higher in the dyslexic students. Further analyses revealed group x gender interactions for motivation, time management and fear of failure, with female undergraduates outperforming their male counterparts. Implications for secondary education and university, as well as college student support services are discussed."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"This paper discusses the scientific instruments made and used by the microscopist Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). The immediate cause of our study was the discovery of an overlooked document from the Delft archive: an inventory of the possessions that were left in 1745 after the death of Leeuwenhoek's daughter Maria. This list sums up which tools and scientific instruments Leeuwenhoek possessed at the end of his life, including his famous microscopes. This information, combined with the results of earlier historical research, gives us new insights about the way Leeuwenhoek began his lens grinding and how eventually he made his best lenses. It also teaches us more about Leeuwenhoek's work as a surveyor and a wine gauger. A further investigation of the 1747 sale of Leeuwenhoek's 531 single lens microscopes has not only led us to the identification of nearly all buyers, but also has provided us with some explanation about why only a dozen of this large number of microscopes has survived."

Rehabilitation	"Research on daily living activities and employment levels of adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in Taiwan is limited. The aims of the study were to investigate outcomes related to functional independence and employment among people with ASD in Taiwan. We investigated the daily living activities and the employment status of 81 adults (age range, 18-48 years; mean age, 22.8 years) with ASD in southern Taiwan. Most (85.2%) participants with ASD were men, and all lived with their caregivers or guardians. Primary caregivers or guardians completed a self-administered, written questionnaire. More than three-quarters (80.2%) of the participants with ASD could independently take care of themselves. Instrumental activities of daily living they most frequently engaged in included walking outside for more than 15 min (88.9%), light housework (85.2%), and local shopping (80.2%). Only 11 (13.6%) of the participants with ASD were employed [five (6.2%) worked more than 20 h/week] and four (4.9%) were attending school. Types of occupation consisted of serving food and beverages, baking, and cleaning. Most (81.5%) of the participants with ASD were unemployed, stayed at home, and were cared for by family members. The results of this study provide information to support the design of adequate interventions to meet the needs of adults with ASD, particularly those in Taiwan. It is important to develop adequate interventions to facilitate the functional independence of this population. Future research using larger study populations with a comparison group is needed."
Area Studies	"This article explores the dynamics and contradictions of capital accumulation in South Korea from 1980 to 2014 by analysing the rates of surplus value and profit and criticises two theses of financialisation and income-led growth. The rate of surplus value soared after 2000 because the real wage growth was contained by the neo-liberal onslaught against workers. The profit rate consistently declined after 1987, paving the way for the 1997 crisis and its main driver was the rising organic composition of capital. After the 1997 crisis, the profit rate rebounded for six years thanks to the intensified exploitation of workers. From 2002 until the 2008 global financial crisis, the rate of profit dropped again. However, contrary to the financialisation thesis, there has been no substantial transfer of surplus value from the real sector to the financial sector. Our results also show that the accumulation rate determined income distribution, not vice versa, contradicting the income-led growth strategy, now popular among the Korean progressives. Marxian macro-dynamics is operating as usual in Korea."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"The need for training mental health counselors in risk and prevention is presented, and justification of the development of an innovative and integrative prevention training program is offered. Theoretical underpinnings that connect the counseling discipline to the field of prevention are described. A risk and prevention training model from Harvard Graduate School of Education is presented as a case example that illustrates the integration of prevention practices into a counselor training curriculum. Prevention research initiatives are described as vehicles for interactive learning and training. Challenges and future opportunities for programmatic implementation are reviewed with attention towards systematic planning and program design."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Wage gap decomposition shows that declining union power was the principal force behind the shrinking union wage premium in the U.S. construction industry between the 1980s and the 2000s. This decline was largely offset by changes in returns to workforce attributes and workforce compositions. Without these moderating effects, the decline in the wage gap would have been twice as large (in log points). The patterns were similar in the basic and mechanical trades, but magnitudes of change were larger in the latter."
Criminology & Penology	"This study examines the reorganization of robbery detectives from a decentralized to centralized model in one large department, with the purpose of understanding whether organizational structure affects robbery clearance. Time-series regression models (Auto-Regressive, Integrated, Moving Average) demonstrate that the percentage of investigation-eligible robberies cleared by arrest increased and reported robberies decreased subsequent to the reorganization. Additionally, interviews indicated organizational changes in case processing with respect to information collection and use, cooperation among detectives and other police, and the police-prosecutor interface. The organization of robbery detectives appears to be important to case clearances and crime reduction. A more comprehensive research program on police investigations is recommended to fully assess the costs and benefits of detective configurations."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Low health literacy is associated with poor medication adherence and poor health outcomes. Limited understanding of prescribed medications may decrease validity of patient-reported adherence measures. Objectives: To assess knowledge of names and purposes of prescribed medications among patients with multiple chronic conditions. Methods: Individual interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of patients from six U.S. primary care clinics. Participants (n = 57) were English and/or Spanish-speaking patients prescribed 3thorn medications for chronic conditions, for which non-adherence may lead to disability or death. In individual interviews, patients were asked to name their medications, explain the purpose of each, and to explain how they distinguish them from one another. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded; coded content was quantified by 1) whether or not the patient could name medications; 2) method of categorizing medications; 3) whether or not the purpose of the medication was understood. Descriptive statistics were compiled using Fisher's exact test to determine the relationship between patient knowledge and medication characteristics. Results: Thirty percent of patients could not name at least one of their medications; 19% did not know their purpose; 30% held misconceptions about the purpose of one or more medications. There was no significant difference in ability to name medications or state their medication's purpose between patients using medi-sets, pre-packaged rolls, or blister packs, and patients who stored pills in their original containers (p = 0.56 and p = 0.73, respectively), or across demographic groups (p = 0.085 to 0.767). Conclusions: Many patients demonstrated difficulty identifying the name and purpose of prescribed medications; this did not differ by demographic group or medication storage type. Patients may benefit from routine review of medications with their provider in order to improve health literacy, outcomes, and patient-reported adherence measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Social Issues	"Nonprofits theory on the role of organizational context focuses on generalizing principles such as neoinstitutionalism and institutional isomorphism. Organizational culture theory focuses on internal organizational culture, ignoring the larger community culture that influences nonprofit behavior. Relying on anthropological understandings of culture as comprising both the values and symbols of a community and its structures and practices, this article describes three support systems for faith-based nonprofits that come out of founding religious traditions. Using comparative case studies across 81 faith communities and FBOs in the United States, research suggests that systems are generalizable across religions and localities, but they come out of specific religious cultures adapted to fit the U.S. system."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"The texts (and talk) of engineers take different forms. In this essay, I present and critique several texts written for different purposes and audiences but all intended to convey to the reader the technical details of whatever they are about-whether a textbook passage describing the fundamental behavior of an electrical component, a journal article about a mathematical technique intended for use in design optimization, a memo to co-workers within a firm about a heat transfer analysis of a remotely sited building, or a general introduction to the field of? ergonomics? My aim is to explore how the ways in which engineers describe and document their problems and projects frame what they accept, display and profess as useful knowledge. In this I am particularly interested in how engineers envision the 'users' of, or participants in, their productions. Like science, engineering texts are written as if they were timeless and untainted by socio-cultural features. However, a technical treatise is not devoid of metaphor or creative rendering of events; there is always a narrative within which worldly data and instrumental logic is embedded-but it is a story in which the passive voice prevails, history is irrelevant, and the human actor or agent is painted in quantitative parameters fitting the occasion. Whether this rhetoric can be sustained in the face of challenges to traditional ways of doing engineering is an open question."
Management	"We conduct an empirical study to analyze how waiting in queue in the context of a retail store affects customers' purchasing behavior. Our methodology combines a novel data set with periodic information about the queuing system (collected via video recognition technology) with point-of-sales data. We find that waiting in queue has a nonlinear impact on purchase incidence and that customers appear to focus mostly on the length of the queue, without adjusting enough for the speed at which the line moves. An implication of this finding is that pooling multiple queues into a single queue may increase the length of the queue observed by customers and thereby lead to lower revenues. We also find that customers' sensitivity to waiting is heterogeneous and negatively correlated with price sensitivity, which has important implications for pricing in a multiproduct category subject to congestion effects."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Democracy and opposition are supposed to go hand in hand. Opposition did not emerge as automatically as expected after Indonesia democratized, however, because presidents shared power much more widely than expected. The result has been what I call party cartelization, Indonesian-style. This differs significantly from canonical cases of party cartelization in Europe. Yet it exhibits the same troubling outcome for democratic accountability: the stunted development of a clearly identifiable party opposition. Since the advent of direct presidential elections in 2004, Indonesian democratic competition has unsurprisingly assumed somewhat more of a government vs. opposition cast. But this shift has arisen more from contingent failures of elite bargaining than from any decisive change in the power-sharing game. So long as Indonesia""s presidents consider it strategically advantageous to share power with any party that declares its support, opposition will remain difficult to identify and vulnerable to being extinguished entirely in the world""s largest emerging democracy."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"Being retained a grade in school has been associated with a number of negative outcomes for children. It is unclear, however, if being bullied is among them. In this study, differences were examined between retained and promoted students in their self-reported bullying victimization-verbal, physical, and social/relational bullying, and bullying in general. Unique to the study was that those differences were investigated as a function of students being in public or private schools. It was hypothesized that greater bullying of retained students would occur in private schools, where being retained is less common. The sample consisted of 378 students, grades 5 through 9, attending four public and two private schools in Southern Brazil. Retained students in private schools reported greater verbal and social/relational bullying, and bullying in general, than retained students in public schools. Differences in bullying victimization were not found between promoted, once-retained, and multiple-retained students in public schools (due to sample size this was not examined in private schools). Findings suggest the need for interventions that target pre-retention behaviors that may be associated with being bullied. A secondary purpose of the study was to provide evidence supporting the factor structure of the Brazilian Portuguese version of Delaware Bullying Victimization Scale - Student (Brazilian DBVS-S). CFA results supported both a bifactor model and three-factor model, but support was stronger for the latter. Reliability of the three subscale and total scale scores was evidenced by internal consistency coefficients above .70."
Economics	"In a haystack-type representation of a heterogeneous population that is evolving according to a payoff structure of a prisoner's dilemma game, migration is modeled as a process of 'swapping' individuals between heterogeneous groups of constant size after a random allocation fills the haystacks, but prior to mating. Migration is characterized by two parameters: an exogenous participation-in-migration cost (of search, coordination, movement, and arrangement-making) which measures the migration effort, and an exogenous technology-of coordinating and facilitating movement between populated haystacks and the colonization of currently unpopulated haystacks-which measures the migration intensity. Starting from an initially heterogeneous population that consists of both cooperators and defectors, a scenario is postulated under which 'programmed' migration can act as a mechanism that brings about a long-run survival of cooperation."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Synthetic biology is an emerging approach to biotechnology that strives to use engineering principles and practices to design and make new organisms. Proponents of synthetic biology have big aspirations for this field, citing potential for an industrial revolution in biotechnology. This article is concerned with how value is being negotiated and constituted through practice in synthetic biology - through the promises being made, through the objects and products being produced, through the initiatives and institutions being established, and through the work practices and justificatory strategies of synthetic biologists. In particular, I focus on negotiations surrounding the making, use and circulation of BioBrick (TM) standard biological parts. BioBricks are presented as tools that will make genetic engineering more efficient and reliable, and are accompanied by a particular imagination of innovation and value creation in synthetic biology. But exploring valuation practices in action reveals a number of sites of ambivalence and contestation over the BioBrick approach to synthetic biology. Through a series of vignettes, I show how these negotiations over the promises and practices surrounding BioBricks are configuring the epistemic foundations and design space of the field, and are helping to define what value means in synthetic biology."
Family Studies	"Although parents and children must adhere to five primary treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF), and their roles transition over time, the scope of CF studies often has been limited to one treatment regimen or to children within a specified age range. The purpose of this mixed research synthesis study is to integrate findings from qualitative and quantitative studies addressing the transition of CF management from parent to child, as well as factors related to adherence across treatments and over time. An existing grounded theory was used as a framework to synthesize findings in 17 reports from 16 studies. The results confirm the theory and posit 3 additional factors that may influence parent-to-child transition of care management."
Economics	"The consequences of private information concerning the realization of aggregate demand shocks are investigated in the context of a standard macroeconomic model. It is found that an improvement in information quality can be damaging, in the sense of amplifying employment fluctuations. The source of this result is an externality arising from individual firm wage decisions, which leads to a collective over-reaction to private information. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Ethics	"In a pair of influential papers, Tamar Schapiro argues that childhood is a predicament"", in that children lack stable characters that allow them to be subjects of ascriptions of moral responsibility. Comparing childhood to the political state of nature"", Schapiro holds that childhood is a stage of life from which agents must be liberated. I argue that the comparison to the state of nature gives rise to the implication that instantaneous adulthood"" would be a desirable state. Canvassing the nascent literature on intrinsic goods of childhood"", I hold that such views cannot defeat Schapiro""s implications, as they are based on theories of value that beg the question against Schapiro""s. Only if childhood can be shown to be a necessary stage toward a normatively attractive adulthood can the instantaneous adulthood"" implication be defeated. I show that Schapiro""s view is only plausible if it incorporates the endorsement condition and the articulacy condition. But these are incompatible with instantaneous adulthood. Childhood can be seen as the stage in life in which agents actively endorse their characters, and gain articulacy with respect to the maxims that constitute them."
Rehabilitation	"Medical science and other sources, such as the media, increasingly inform the general public's understanding of disease. There is often discordance between this understanding and the diagnostic interpretations of health care practitioners (HCPs). In this paper - based on a supra-analysis of qualitative interview data from two studies of joint pain, including osteoarthritis - we investigate how people imagine and make sense of the pathophysiology of their illness, and how these understandings may affect self-management behavior. We then explore how HCPs' use of medical images and models can inform patients' understanding. In conceptualizing their illness to make sense of their experience of the disease, individuals often used visualizations of their inner body; these images may arise from their own lay understanding, or may be based on images provided by HCPs. When HCPs used anatomical models or medical images judiciously, patients' orientation to their illness changed. Including patients in a more collaborative diagnostic event that uses medical images and visual models to support explanations about their condition may help them to achieve a more meaningful understanding of their illness and to manage their condition more effectively."
Family Studies	"Family building by bisexual mothers is a neglected area of research, yet this is an important aspect of life course development that may reciprocally influence the sexual identity development of bisexual women and family processes around parenting. Family map drawings (genograms) and interview data were collected from eight cisgender women from the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland who spoke about their bisexual parenting experience and family relationships. Thematic narrative analysis indicates that participants depict both heteronormative (traditional) extended kinship networks (radiating out from a family core centering on them and their children) and family of choice network features. Nonetheless certain features appear to be more indirectly presented on some participants' family maps: namely, complex or marginalized (erased) relationships with additional partners that may sustain sexual identity but contradict both heteronormative and homonormative presentations of family life. Our discussion considers the difficult issues bisexual mothers face in maintaining both their family relationships and a marginalized sexual identity."
Women'S Studies	"Drawing on interview-based ethnographic research in Ankara, this article studies formations of femininity across social classes in urban Turkey. It centers on four young women, who have unequal access to economic resources and different cultural meanings. Through their biographies, this paper examines the effects of social class on experiences of gender and negotiations of femininity, on the one hand. And on the other, it demonstrates common narratives that young women employ in negotiating gender. While they commonly escape certain forms of femininity, which they frequently describe as traditional, backward, or submissive, they also employ alternative narratives such as independence, career success, moderation, chastity, and religiosity to attest self-value and respectability. Studying young women's experiences of gender and their negotiations of power provides fertile ground for further exploration of the construction of gender and class in relational terms.

Cultural Studies	"This essay tracks George Eliot's construction of a layer of descriptions of characters as soft matter-as liquids, polymers, and other types of condensed matter in a malleable state-in her 1874 novel Middlemarch, elucidating what Brilmyer calls a physics of character from within its pages. In so doing, it suggests that even the most notoriously ""brainy'' of novels-on the level of its descriptions-resists a too-easy alignment of its characters with individual human psychologies.

Communication	"Previous research has shown the importance of Donald Trump's Twitter activity, and that of his Twitter following, in spreading his message during the primary and general election campaigns of 2015-2016. However, we know little about how the publics who followed Trump and amplified his messages took shape. We take this case as an opportunity to theorize and test questions about the assembly of what we call ""attentive publics"" in social media. We situate our study in the context of current discussions of audience formation, attention flow, and hybridity in the United States' political media system. From this we derive propositions concerning how attentive publics aggregate around a particular object, in this case Trump himself, which we test using time series modeling. We also present an exploration of the possible role of automated accounts in these processes. Our results reiterate the media hybridity described by others, while emphasizing the importance of news media coverage in building social media attentive publics."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Nonresponse rates have been growing over time leading to concerns about survey data quality. Adaptive designs seek to allocate scarce resources by targeting specific subsets of sampled units for additional effort or a different recruitment protocol. In order to be effective in reducing nonresponse, the identified subsets of the sample need two key features: 1) their probabilities of response can be impacted by changing design features, and 2) once they have responded, this can have an impact on estimates after adjustment. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is investigating the use of adaptive design techniques in the Crops Acreage, Production, and Stocks Survey (Crops APS). The Crops APS is a survey of establishments which vary in size and, hence, in their potential impact on estimates. In order to identify subgroups for targeted designs, we conducted a simulation study that used Census of Agriculture (COA) data as proxies for similar survey items. Different patterns of nonresponse were simulated to identify subgroups that may reduce estimated nonresponse bias when their response propensities are changed."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Despite recommendations that the restaurant industry more readily engage suppliers within their operations in order to expand capabilities, associations with restaurant business performance and supplier relationships remain unexplored in today's current restaurant literature. This study assessed restaurant-supplier relationships from the social capital perspective and evaluated roles social capital played in product enhancement and new product development within the independent restaurant context. Results demonstrated that independent restaurant product enhancement was positively and linearly associated with social capital derived from restaurant supplier relationships. Results also found that building social capital within restaurant-supplier relationships positively influenced new product development, but when taken to an extreme, it exhibited a negative association through an inverted curvilinear effect. Results provide new insights for future research and practice regarding independent restaurant supply management practices."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Most population health researchers conceptualize social class as a set of attributes and material conditions of life of individuals. The empiricist tradition of 'class as an individual attribute' equates class to an 'observation', precluding the investigation of unobservable social mechanisms. Another consequence of this view of social class is that it cannot be conceptualized, measured, or intervened upon at the meso- or macro levels, being reduced to a personal attribute. Thus, population health disciplines marginalize rich traditions in Marxist theory whereby 'class' is understood as a 'hidden' social mechanism such as exploitation. Yet Neo-Marxist social class has been used over the last two decades in population health research as a way of understanding how health inequalities are produced. The Neo-Marxist approach views social class in terms of class relations that give persons control over productive assets and the labour power of others (property and managerial relations). We critically appraise the contribution of the Neo-Marxist approach during the last two decades and suggest realist amendments to understand class effects on the social determinants of health and health outcomes. We argue that when social class is viewed as a social causal mechanism it can inform social change to reduce health inequalities."
Rehabilitation	"The number of Americans needing long-term services and supports (LTSS) is projected to more than double in the coming decades largely due to an aging baby boomer population, meaning paying for LTSS will become an even greater challenge for American families and the country. Despite the benefits of aging in place, there remains a long-standing institutional bias within the Medicaid program, where services in nursing facilities are mandatory while home- and community-based services (HCBS) are mostly optional for states to cover. This study examined HCBS 1915(c) waivers (n = 61 waivers) for older adults to categorize and compare service priorities. Findings revealed waivers for older adults were primarily focused on supporting individuals in their own homes to age in place. However, findings also revealed HCBS waivers are an underutilized mechanism for funding the LTSS of older adults. As states continue to deal with an increasing population of aging adults, with and without disabilities, the HCBS waiver option will continue to be an important component of a state""s service system."
Geography	"This paper argues that positive social capital underpins the key factors identified by Ostrom (1990) in self-governance systems. The paper discusses the different types of social capital from a social network perspective and empirically analyses social capital in the context of two neighboring aquifers in central Spain. It examines the type of institutional arrangements that foster or hinder the creation of social capital by discussing in turn, bonding and bridging social capital with particular reference to water user groups, taken as classic collective management institutions, illustrating also the role leaders play as linking social capital and catalysts (or obstacles) in the creation and blending of different types of social capital. It concludes that social capital is differentially embedded in social networks and that careful institutional design can help foster strong 'positive' social capital, which in turn favors self-governance in groundwater. It also stresses the dynamic nature of social capital through time and its productive aspect in terms of incentivizing social learning and collective action in groundwater management.

"Business, Finance"	"This paper investigates how managerial expertise specifically, industry expertise affects firm value through divestiture. Using CEOs' managerial experiences in industries throughout their careers as a measure of their industry expertise, I find that CEOs in diversified conglomerates are more likely to divest divisions in industries in which they have less experience. This finding is consistent with CEOs who divest such divisions in order to refocus on those divisions in which they have specialized that is, to achieve a better match between their expertise and their firms' retained assets. Firms that divest for a better CEO-firm match experience significant improvements in operating performance, as well as significant abnormal stock returns that persist for an average of three years following a divestiture. Further, among firms that divest for a better match, those firms with more experienced CEOs realize greater gains in firm value. In contrast, divestitures that increase corporate focus, but do not improve the expertise-asset match, do not lead to long-run increases in firm value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Ethnic Studies	"Indigenous Australian health is distinguished by a median age of death in the order of 20 years less than that of the non-indigenous population (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009). This makes Australia unique among comparable post-colonial societies in failing to make substantive reductions to the indigenous/non-indigenous health differential. Relatively poor indigenous housing, educational attainment, labour market participation and access to traditional resources for economic purposes contribute to the differential. These contributing variables have an inherently political character which is integral to examining the just distribution of public authority, the purpose of political activity, equal political participation and cultural responsiveness in the provision of health services as important theoretical considerations in reducing cross-cultural inequities in the burden of disease."
Sociology	"Parents play important roles in their children's lives, and parental involvement in elementary school in particular is meaningful for a range of child outcomes. Given the increasing number of school-aged children with incarcerated parents, this study explores the ways paternal incarceration is associated with mothers' and fathers' reports of home-and school-based involvement in schooling. Using Fragile Families Study data, we find that a father's incarceration inhibits his school-and home-based involvement in schooling, but associations for maternal involvement are weaker. Results are robust to alternative specifications of incarceration that address concerns about selection and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings also hold across levels of father-child contact. We also conducted a test of the system avoidance mechanism and results suggest it partially explains reductions in school involvement for fathers following incarceration. Given the reoccurring interest in the interconnection between families and schools and how this translates into success, this study suggests that paternal incarceration is associated with lower parental involvement in schooling and highlights the role of system avoidance in this association. Attachment to social institutions like schools is quite consequential, and this work highlights another way mass incarceration influences social life in the United States."
Sociology	"Although apprenticeship training has been praised for its effectiveness in easing the transition of non-college-bound students from school to work, most studies rely on cross-country or cross-track comparisons. This study compares apprenticeship training students with non-apprentices within educational track in a relatively uncoordinated and decentralized institutional setting. Using a rich database and a unique set of observable individual-level characteristics as well as local labor market fixed effects to control for the potential selection bias, the results show that there are no significant differences in employment opportunities between apprentices and non-apprentices within just a year after graduation. This might be due to the failure of the Hungarian firms to enhance the skills of apprentices and thus increase their chances of entering the labor market compared to their school-trained peers. However, some immediate positive effect of apprenticeship training within sub-populations is apparent, which are likely to be the result of screening. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Anthropology	"During 1869 and 1870 British naval officer George Ch. Musters traveled 2,750 km from the Strait of Magellan to Rio Negro, as a member of a convoy headed by cacique Casimiro when Patagonia was still an autonomous territory. By systematizing data from Musters' chronicle, and applying software for graphs, this article focuses on the analysis of social networks woven by these actors during the journey. Based on this methodology, the article poses a critical discussion of the culturalist anthropology and its refutation by authors who considered the ethnic identity of Tehuelches as an imposition of the colonialist imagination. The hypothesis is that Casimiro's convoy can be understood as a geographical, political, kinship, business and warfare itinerary which was defining the historical meanings of the Tehuelche identification during the context of expansive processes of colonialism and nation states of Argentina and Chile."
Gerontology	"ObjectivesTo explore the association between history of several types of abuse and falling. DesignCross-sectional population-based study. SettingData from the Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento (Health, Well-being, and Aging) Bogota Study. ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling adults aged 60 and older living in Bogota, Colombia (n=2,000). MeasurementsFalling was defined as the number of times a person had fallen during the previous 12 months. History of abuse was assessed according to self-report. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between elder abuse and falling, adjusting for potential confounders. ResultsMultivariate data analyses showed significant higher odds of any falls (1 vs 0) for past emotional (odds ratio (OR)=1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.23-1.90), physical (OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.57-2.51), or sexual (OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.78-5.32) abuse. Similarly, the odds of recurrent falls (2 vs 0-1) were significantly higher with each type of abuse. In addition, the odds of any falls and recurrent falls were significant higher in participants with polyvictimization (2 types of abuse) than in those with no history of abuse or 1 type of abuse. ConclusionHistory of abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual) was strongly associated with falling in older adults living in Bogota. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and further delineate the independent effects of elder abuse on fall risk."
Health Policy & Services	"Objective: Most cancer patients experience the time when a doctor must ""break the bad news"" to them, a time when it is necessary for patients to call upon their self-determination to aid in the battle with cancer. The purpose of our study was to clarify the percentage of times doctors deliver bad news to patients at the end of life in each of four different situations, and to define the most common recipients of this bad news. We compare these results for two timepoints: 2006 and 2012. Methods: The study had a national cross-sectional design consisting of self-completed questionnaires sent to all hospitals that provide cancer care. We mailed them to hospital directors in January and February of 2012, requesting a reply. The results of the same survey in 2006 were employed as a point for comparison. Results: A total of 1224 questionnaireswere returned during 2012. 1499 responses collected in 2006 were employed as reference data. Some hospital characteristics had changed over that interval; however, the new data obtained were representative for patients being treated in Japanese cancer care hospitals. In hospitals with 300-499, there were significant differences between 2006 and 2012 in the providing information about (""disclosure of cancer diagnosis,"" ""therapeutic options for treatment,"" and ""a life-prolonging treatment""). In addition, the likelihood of doctors delivering bad news to patients and family members (as opposed to family members only) at the end of life increased from 2006 to 2012. Significance of Results: Our results suggest that the overall incidence of bad news being disclosed has increased, especially in hub medical institutions for cancer care. Advanced treatment options or domestic legislation may have influenced the frequency or type of bad news."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: Being able to travel independently, whether as a pedestrian or by taking public transportation, is a critical element to maintaining quality of life and participation in the community. The objective of this systematic review is to understand the best practices and effective components of pedestrian and public transit training interventions for youth with disabilities. Method: Systematic searches of seven international databases identified 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. We analyzed these studies based on participant characteristics, methods, results, and quality of evidence. Results: Among the 29 studies, 857 participants (aged 5?39, mean 18.3 years) were represented across 10 countries. Although the intervention outcomes varied across the studies, 24 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: pedestrian and general navigation skills, pedestrian safety, landmark recognition, route knowledge, and public transportation skills. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that pedestrian and public transit interventions have the potential to improve the participation and quality of life of children and youth with disabilities. More rigorous, theoretically informed interventions, using standardized measures are needed to enhance pedestrian and transit training skills among youth with disabilities."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"The proposed revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), has reignited a protracted debate in psychiatry and clinical psychology regarding the criteria used to diagnose and classify mental disorders. Drawing on the concepts of legitimisation and hegemony, the aim of this study is to deconstruct how the authoritativeness of the DSM was discursively constructed, legitimised and consolidated over time. To fulfil this purpose, we combine a critical psychology perspective with critical discourse analysis and adopt a multi-level model of analysis that embraces the notions of genre and repertoire in scientific discourse. The materials were approached considering the following interrelated dimensions: (a) semantic macro-areas; (b) discursive strategies; and (c) linguistic means. The data set is constituted by the Forewords and Introductions of different editions of the DSM, from the DSM-I through to the DSM-5. The analysis highlights the discursive strategies that play an important role in self-legitimisation and the construction of a dominant hegemonic discourse."
Information Science & Library Science	"Citation studies and analyses of usage statistics are two approaches academic librarians take to determine if their journal collections support the needs of research faculty. Librarians at a small, regional liberal arts university compiled a list of faculty journal publications covering a thirteen-year span from four academic departments-nursing, chemistry, biology, and mathematics-and, from these publications, generated a list of the journals that were cited. As expected, this university's faculty members publish in many of the same journals that they cite. However, faculty members cite a wide range of sources. Wiley journal usage statistics were examined from 2011 and 2012 to determine if the number of PDF downloads of articles in the published in and cited Wiley journals were higher than the average numbers of PDF downloads of Wiley journals. Combining an analysis of usage statistics with citation analysis provides a more strategic way to look at a Big Deal package. This information is of interest to the departments represented and other stakeholders, and the implications for collection development purposes are addressed."
Rehabilitation	"Background. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that impacts a person's fitness to drive. Practitioners require a sensitive and predictive battery of clinical tests to identify at-risk drivers. Purpose. This study aimed to identify clinical predictors and their optimal cut points, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of on-road outcomes in drivers with PD. Method. Participants (N = 101) underwent a comprehensive driving evaluation. We identified predictors of pass/fail outcomes through logistic regression and computed optimal cut points through receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding Youden indexes. Findings. The Trail Making Test Part B (Trails B; sensitivity = .89, specificity = .74; positive predictive value [PPV] = .71; negative predictive value [NPV] = .91) and contrast sensitivity (sensitivity = .82, specificity = .63; PPV = .61; NPV = .84) emerged as significant predictors. The optimal cut point for the Trails B was 108 s (area under the curve = .86). Implications. Occupational therapists can benefit from implementing Trails B and contrast sensitivity screening as part of in-office screening of potentially at-risk drivers with PD."
Women'S Studies	"In this article the author explores the biographic narrative as a process of intersubjective knowledge production in the sense that this process is embodied, situated and partial. The analysis of this process focuses on the biographic narrative of Hajja, a market woman in Darfur, Sudan. Her assertion that what she 'told to the researcher was 'true' is a starting point for understanding the relevance of this 'truth' for the way Hajja negotiated the Islamist moral discourse on gender at the time of narrating. The context of narration proves of main importance in order to understand the identities Hajja prioritized and silenced as well as the shifts in her narratives of self at different moments in time. To consider biographic narratives as a form of feminist knowledge production, the author suggests to understand biographies as 'texts-in-contexts' whereby feminist scholars also write about the process of understanding, since they are part of the context as well. Reflexivity is thereby a tool for analysis whereby the represen, tation of this process of understanding is as important as the product of this process of knowledge production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Public Administration	"The rapid growth of knowledge in disease diagnosis and treatment requires health service provider organizations to continuously learn and update their practices. However, little is known about knowledge sharing in service implementation networks governed by a network administrative organization (NAO). The author suggests that strong ties enhance knowledge sharing and that there is a contingent effect of third-party ties. Two provider agencies' common ties with the NAO may undermine knowledge sharing because of resource competition. In contrast, a dyad's common ties with a peer agency may boost knowledge sharing as a result of social cohesion. Finally, the author posits that third-party ties moderate the relationship between strong ties and knowledge sharing. These hypotheses are examined in a mental health network. Quantitative network analysis confirms the strong tie and third-party tie hypotheses and provides partial support for the moderating effect of third-party ties. The implications for public management, including the implementation of HealthCare.gov, are discussed."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Government's role in tourism planning has shifted from control to consultation, and many governments have adopted economic planning that move the responsibility for investment in infrastructure from the public to the private sector. In Hong Kong, the government has not articulated a clear tourism policy to guide tourism development but continues to assume responsibility for significant tourism infrastructure investment. This paper considers the views of the private sector towards tourism planning in Hong Kong, which gravitate towards the need for a formalized planning. The tourism sector supports the interventionist policies that have been a characteristic of the government's relationship to the tourism industry in the past, believes that the current approach to planning needs to be replaced by a formal planning process, and that there is a need to include community groups in the policy determination process. The insights gained from the case of Hong Kong may serve as a reference for other destinations."
Linguistics	"Handling the data sparseness question is a main way to further enhance the system performances of Head-driven statistical parsing models. Two smoothing methods are proposed to mitigate remaining data-sparseness problems. The first smoothing method is that two word classification algorithms based on word similarity have been developed, which employ the mutual information of two words that are adjoining words or have semantic relationship to define word similarity and word-class similarity. The second smoothing method is to decompose the generation of each internal rule into a sequence of smaller steps, and then to make conditional independence assumptions to incorporate the Part-Of-Speech tags of adjoining words or adjoining phrase tags into the probability computation of the context-free rules, the incorporating additional context information into the syntactic parsing models is very useful for improving the system performances of syntactic parsing. The two category-based statistical analysis models are tested through experiments. The improved parsing model 2 has far better system performances than head-driven parsing model: recall reaches 87.89%, accuracy reaches 88.62, and F-measure is enhanced 8.10% compared with the head-driven analysis method."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article will explore the utility of Swidler's concepts of cultured capacities and strategies of action in mapping the pathways through which area-based, multiple deprivation and inequality impact upon resources for health, health outcomes and health inequalities. It will be argued that these concepts have the potential to bring the collective and aggregated impacts of resource distribution to the fore in unpicking the processes through which area-based inequalities become manifest in health outcomes. This has the potential to illuminate the some of the economic, social and political processes though which neoliberalism has generated widening health inequalities in the United Kingdom. To that end, these concepts will be employed in a case study of the post-industrial town of Clydebank. It will consider the implications for population health of changes in: the amount and quality of employment on offer; the quality and affordability housing; and the accessibility of social and political resources for those who live in more deprived areas. Swidler's concepts will be used to theoretically map the relationships between the growing wealth inequalities, widening place-based inequalities and increasing health inequalities observed over the past few decades in the United Kingdom."
Communication	"This article investigates whether social media in general-using Facebook as an example-warrant identification of a new public sphere, another private sphere, or a different corporate sphere, as some scholars have argued. It is argued that social media platforms neither warrant a recalibration of Habermas' public sphere, nor a conscious blending of spheres. Rather, social media platforms form a contested space where private, public and corporate interests compete to produce new norms of sociality and connectivity. In order to understand the dynamics of social media, it is not enough to revamp existing social theory of networks, to polish up legal frames, or to reintroduce political-economic schemes. We need to connect these theories and come up with an analytical model that accounts for the complexities of the various interests interpenetrating the new space of mediated communication."
Development Studies	"The article analyzes the ways in which globalized oil extraction results in the dispossession of local people and fuels violent resistance in Nigeria's oil-rich, but impoverished Niger Delta. This follows from the transformation of resistance from non-violent to violent forms, involving well-publicized attacks by Niger Delta, ethnic-minority militias against the Nigerian state oil multinationals partnership. The main argument is that oil extraction and the inequitable distribution of its benefits fuel disenchantment and conflict between the Niger Delta people, and those regarded as the exploiters and beneficiaries of the oil resources in the region. It also examines the local and transnational dynamics and ambiguities underpinning resistance politics and the prospects for resolving the contradictions spawned by ""fossil fuel capital"" in the Niger Delta."
Criminology & Penology	"Victimization in the USA is a substantial concern, despite a trend of decreasing crime rates. Victims of crime face a number of short-term consequences such as physical injury, fear and anxiety, and/or loss of property. Long-term consequences of victimization, however, may often be overlooked. Using the first six waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, the current study examines the relationship between early experiences of victimization and long-term physical and mental health outcomes, including general health, access to and use of health care, and health risk behaviors. Results find that individuals who are victimized before the age of 12, especially those who experienced repeated bullying, are more susceptible to a number of physical and mental health issues such as negative perceptions of physical and mental health, smoking, subsequent victimization experiences, and homelessness. Public health concerns and policy implications of these findings are also discussed."
Rehabilitation	"Supervision for music therapists is often regarded as useful for professional development, and for processing clinical and non-clinical issues, which arise from practice. However, little is known about the research evidence, which informs this practice and its links to improved professional competency and clinical outcomes. A narrative synthesis was conducted to map the types of supervision literature, identify corresponding research evidence and examine effective models of music therapy supervision. Relevant databases were searched and the authors identified a considerable body of literature relating to professional supervision (n=48), with only five, mostly qualitative, research studies identified. Review results show that supervision is useful for assisting a therapist's professional and personal insight into clinical practice although the effects of the intervention remain unknown. Two core interactive ingredients constitute professional supervision: (1) flexible and creative approaches towards practice and learning, including the use of music as a supervision tool; (2) a supervisory relationship, which is fundamental to the process. These ingredients are shaped by three underlying concepts: (1) shared experience between supervisor and supervisee; (2) improved insights; and (3) qualities of an effective supervisory relationship. Results revealed an overall lack of evaluation studies and an over-reliance on qualitative design. The discipline would now benefit from research that measures the effects of professional supervision on patient outcomes and professional competencies."
Communication	"A persuasive campaign with elements of propaganda was waged on social media against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential race, partially through a Russian-financed effort to discredit her. This study analyzed doctored images (memes) posted on Twitter about Clinton during the general election campaign. Through qualitative content analysis, researchers sought to identify whether negative memes reflected socially constructed gender stereotypes. Results show gendered frames used in memes against Clinton were based on female biological/physical traits (weak, ill, unattractive), anti-feminine traits (dishonest, untrustworthy), and negative female politician traits (dictatorial, unqualified) that were incongruent with the perceived role of the presidency."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This paper analyses the application of the cluster concept to tourist destinations using Benidorm as a case study. A questionnaire was administered to tourism firms based in Benidorm in order to determine whether this destination currently constitutes a tourism cluster or whether it possesses the ideal characteristics to become a cluster with the private agents' collaboration, that is, whether it is a potential cluster. The results obtained from this research indicate that Benidorm's success is not derived from the presence of a cluster due to a series of elements that prevent its existence. In this destination there is a need to strengthen cooperation between public and private agents (especially in those areas that determine the competitive advantage of the destination) and to design a strategy based on shared goals. Both of these elements are fundamental for the characterisation of a cluster."
Business	"This paper analyzes how a firm should adjust its marketing expenditures and its price to defend its position in an existing market from attack by a competitive new product. Our focus is to provide usable managerial recommendations on the strategy of response. In particular we show that if products can be represented by their position in a multiattribute space, consumers are heterogeneous and maximize utility, and awareness advertising and distribution can be summarized by response functions, then for the profit maximizing firm: it is optimal to decrease awareness advertising, it is optimal to decrease the distribution budget unless the new product can be kept out of the market, a price increase may be optimal, and even under the optimal strategy, profits decrease as a result of the competitive new product. Furthermore, if the consumer tastes are uniformly distributed across the spectrum a price decrease increases defensive profits, it is optimal (at the margin) to improve product quality in the direction of the defending product's strength and it is optimal (at the margin) to reposition by advertising in the same direction. In addition we provide practical procedures to estimate (1) the distribution of consumer tastes and (2) the position of the new product in perceptual space from sales data and knowledge of the percent of consumers who are aware of the new product and find it available. Competitive diagnostics, such as the angle of attack, are introduced to help the defending manager."
Demography	"The study focuses on examining the ages at which the first steady job took place in three cohorts of Mexican men and women (1936-1938, 1951-1953 and 1966-1968). We analyze the socio-demographic factors associated with it. The aim was to clarify how the cohort differences and the socioeconomic and gender inequalities affected the initiation of the labor life during the second part of the 20th century. The research indicates that in spite of the historical, social, economic and cultural changes the country registered, men and women continued entering adulthood following the gender roles, regardless of their socioeconomic stratum. The masculine incorporation was almost universal, while in the feminine population this transition did not become institutionalized as a part of their life."
Communication	"The aim of the Fira de Recerca en Directe 2015 (Live Research Fair) held at the Barcelona science museum CosmoCaixa is to encourage young people in our country to take up scientific careers. At each stand, students were presented with a scientific enigma and were encouraged to find the answer to it through conversations with researchers and through experiments using laboratory equipment. At the Tradumatica Research Group's stand, we presented research we have been carrying out in Machine Translation (MT) and MT postediting. Traditionally, scientific outreach programs have a unidirectional format from researchers to the citizenry. However, our experiences at the Fair on the perception young people have of MT clearly show a bidirectional interaction between researchers and the young people, and this experience helped us come up with ideas to improve our research."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Numerous studies have found that increased hospital or surgeon operative volumes, as measured by the number of procedures performed, are associated with improved patient outcomes after surgery. These findings have been used to support important health policy decisions about regionalization of surgical services, in which provision of specific surgical services is restricted to hospitals that maintain operative volumes above a specified threshold. The most common statistical approach in volume-outcome studies is to regress patient outcomes on a set of patient characteristics and a variable denoting provider volume. When outcomes are binary, such as operative mortality, logistic regression is used, resulting in the odds ratio being the reported measure of association. However, the odds ratio is a relative measure of effect and does not allow policy makers to estimate the absolute benefit of regionalization.Objectives: To describe how G-computation can be used to estimate the expected number of lives saved due to regionalization of surgical services.Research Design: Retrospective cohort design of patients undergoing 1 of 3 different surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada.Results: Regionalization of colorectal cancer surgery, esophagectomy, or pancreaticoduodenectomy in Ontario could reduce the average annual number of perioperative deaths by 20.2, 2.0, and 3.6, for the 3 procedures, respectively.Conclusions: The absolute reduction in number of operative deaths due to regionalization of surgical procedures can be calculated. This can help inform health policy debate about benefits of regionalization."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This exploratory study analyses the role of tourist experience, especially tourist satisfaction, in subsequent migration from the UK to the municipality of Calva, Mallorca, Spain. An overview and commentary is provided of theory relating to both tourist satisfaction and migration. Through a series of elite interviews, in-depth micro-studies and a questionnaire, which provides a small quantitative component, it is established that the motivation given by tourist satisfaction can be recognised as a key catalyst for migration. Classic migration motivations cannot be entirely discounted, and the migration decisions are multi-stage through time. But tourist satisfaction - and particularly the two satisfaction components of performance and emotion - is especially relevant in the micro-perspective of migration decision-making.

Substance Abuse	"Background and Objectives: Women comprise over one-third of people who use methamphetamine in the United States and have a higher prevalence of negative mental health consequences of methamphetamine use than men. Yet, few studies have investigated the mental health correlates of drug treatment among this population. We examined the relationship between mental disorders, mental health treatment, and drug treatment among women who use methamphetamine. Methods: We used respondent-driven sampling to recruit women who use methamphetamine (N = 322) for a survey about mental disorders, mental health treatment, drug use and treatment, and sociodemographic factors. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated that race/ethnicity, mental health treatment, and presence and number of mental disorders were associated with drug treatment. Multivariable analyses revealed that women who reported mental health treatment during a 6-month period had almost twice the odds of also reporting drug treatment than other women (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.11, 3.25), after controlling for mental disorders and race/ethnicity. Conclusion: Among women who use methamphetamine, participation in one service system (mental health treatment) is a key factor in increasing the odds of participation in another service system (drug treatment). Further research should establish the temporal association between mental health and drug treatment. Scientific Significance: The present study demonstrates the association between mental health treatment and drug treatment, above and beyond presence or number of mental disorders, and provides direction for drug treatment providers seeking to improve treatment entry and participation among women who use methamphetamine."
Nursing	"Australian nurses prepare for specialty practice by undertaking postgraduate theoretical and clinical education in partnership models between universities and hospitals. In our global healthcare system, nurses require advanced critical thinking and strong communication skills to provide safe, high quality patient care. Yet, few education programs focus on developing these skills. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a specific educational strategy that encourages and rewards students to think critically and solve clinical problems individually and in teams. The aim of this study was to investigate critical care nursing students' perceptions and experiences of TBL after it was introduced into the second half of their postgraduate specialty course. Following Ethics Committee approval, thirty-two students were invited to participate in an extended response questionnaire on their perceptions of TBL as part of a larger study. Data were analyzed thematically. Postgraduate students perceived their professional growth was accelerated due to the skills and knowledge acquired through TBL. Four themes underpinned the development and accelerated acquisition of specialty nurse attributes due to TBL: Engagement, Learning Effectiveness, Critical Thinking, and Motivation to Participate. Team-Based Learning offered deep and satisfying learning experiences for students. The early acquisition of advanced critical thinking, teamwork and communication skills, and specialty practice knowledge empowered nurses to provide safe patient care with confidence.

Environmental Studies	"Little is known about the variability of ecosystem service values at spatial scales most relevant to local decision makers. Competing definitions of ecosystem services, the paucity of ecological and economic information, and the lack of standardization in methodology are major obstacles to applying the ecosystem-services approach at the estuary scale. We present a standardized method that combines habitat maps and habitat-faunal associations to estimate ecosystem service values for recreational and commercial fisheries in estuaries. Three case studies in estuaries on the U. S. west coast (Yaquina Bay, Oregon), east coast (Lagoon Pond, Massachusetts), and the Gulf of Mexico (Weeks Bay, Alabama) are presented to illustrate our method's rigor and limitations using available data. The resulting spatially explicit maps of fisheries ecosystem service values show within and between estuary variations in the value of estuarine habitat types that can be used to make better informed resource-management decisions."
Health Policy & Services	"Background: Previous studies identified individual or practice factors that influence practice-based physicians' electronic medical record (EMR) adoption. Less is known about the market factors that influence physicians' EMR adoption. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between environmental market characteristics and physicians' EMR adoption. Methods: The Health Tracking Physician Survey 2008 and Area Resource File (2008) were combined and analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between three dimensions of the market environment (munificence, dynamism, and complexity) and EMR adoption controlling for several physician and practice characteristics. Results: In a nationally representative sample of 4,720 physicians, measures of market dynamism including increases in unemployment, odds ratio (OR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.91, 0.99], or poverty rates, OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.89, 0.96], were negatively associated with EMR adoption. Health maintenance organization penetration, OR = 3.01, 95% CI [1.49, 6.05], another measure of dynamism, was positively associated with EMR adoption. Physicians practicing in areas with a malpractice crisis, OR = 0.82, 95% CI [0.71, 0.94], representing environmental complexity, had lower EMR adoption rates."
Law	"Changes in demographics and patterns of investment in human capital are creating increased scope for international trade in professional services. India, one of the largest exporters of skilled services, and the United States, one of the largest importers of skilled services, are two countries that mirror these broader global trends. The scope for mutually beneficial trade is today inhibited not only by quotas and discriminatory taxation, but also by a number of domestic regulatory requirements-025EFincluding qualification and licensing requirements. To illustrate the nature and implications of these regulatory impediments, this article focuses on the regulatory requirements that Indian professionals face in the US market. It explores the consequences of regulatory discrimination and the economic cost of regulations, and presents some illustrative estimates. The article concludes by examining how the trade-inhibiting impact of regulatory requirements could be addressed through bilateral and multilateral negotiations."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"We evaluated the statistical power of single-indicator latent growth curve models to detect individual differences in change (variances of latent slopes) as a function of sample size, number of longitudinal measurement occasions, and growth curve reliability. We recommend the 2 degree-of-freedom generalized test assessing loss of fit when both slope-related random effects, the slope variance and intercept-slope covariance, are fixed to 0. Statistical power to detect individual differences in change is low to moderate unless the residual error variance is low, sample size is large, and there are more than four measurement occasions. The generalized test has greater power than a specific test isolating the hypothesis of zero slope variance, except when the true slope variance is close to 0, and has uniformly superior power to a Wald test based on the estimated slope variance."
International Relations	"Since outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in several member states of the Eurozone in 2010, the Euro as a success story was suddenly thrown into doubt. In Asia, more and more scholars and policy analysts, a majority of whom had not focused their study on the EU or Euro before the crisis, have criticized the monetary integration in the Eurozone, put into doubt the value of European integration as a whole, and reiterate their pessimistic theses about the future of the European economy. This article represents a rebuttal to this criticism, arguing that the common currency is truly in difficulty but not in an impasse. A return to a success story of the Euro is still probable, if European leaders and their citizens could reestablish a balancing model between the financial discipline and economic growth in the EU, to which a general and in-depth debate over the future of European integration is indispensable."
Area Studies	"This article describes the nature of innovation performance in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the context of its changing national innovation system (NIS). More specifically, it proposes to explain China's lack of frontier innovation as reflected by the low quality of Chinese patents and scientific publications. Moving beyond the NISthe prevailing framework for understanding national innovation ratesthis article offers additional determinants to explain the unique profile of Chinese innovation. Through interviews with stakeholders from each of the three major NIS actor types and analysis of the incentive environment, two determinants of China's high rate of nominal patenting are identified. First, the incentive structure facing inventors, scientists and entrepreneurs is found to be ill-suited to promoting innovation. Second, the ubiquitous officials-rank standard (guan benwei) is identified as a mediating variable that amplifies the effect of suboptimal incentives in promoting nominal (as opposed to real) innovation. In essence, the authors find that ill-structured innovation incentives and the officials-rank standard work in tandem to create a high proportion of nominal innovations in the PRC."
Social Issues	"Assessing the current situation of the religion-science dialogue, it seems that a consensus of nonconsensus has been reached. This nonconsensus provides a pluralistic context for the religion and science dialogue, and one area where this plurality is clear is the discourse on relational models of God and creation. A number of interesting models have gained attention in contemporary theological dialogue with science, yet there is an overriding theme: an emphasis on God's involvement with the world. In this article, I argue that theology has been preoccupied with this emphasis. It is suggested that the theme of the freedom of nature has been underrepresented. This theme of the freedom of nature I argue carries important theological implications. It is suggested that acts or events gain their significance largely by way of being contextualized by the fact that such acts or events could have been otherwise, a realization that might provide the various relational models of God and the world food for thought."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Among the challenges for tuberculosis control is the emergence of multi-drug resistance, which has led to the search for new diagnostic solutions worldwide. The focus of this article is the interplay between innovation of diagnostics for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in India and control through standardization of operational and technical processes. Innovation in diagnostics is closely related to processes of standardization. As a form of social ordering, standardization not only controls patients, bacteria, artefacts, health-care staff and medical providers, but also the diagnostic process as such. On the basis of qualitative fieldwork, I analyse the innovative efforts of a demonstration project for a new test by an international NGO and the development of tests by smaller players. The main argument is that a balance is needed between the extremes of controlling the diagnostic process through standardization in such a way that it becomes exclusive for particular local settings or expertise, and innovating a diagnostic test without standardizing operational processes, which is not programmatically feasible. These negotiations between innovation and control can be found in situated assessments, yet require flexibility in standardization.

Development Studies	"Climate change mitigation and land grabbing are distinct but not isolated phenomena. There is evidence that their intersection and interaction contribute to rapid agrarian transformations with dire social and ecological spillover, including the onset and aggravation of conflicts. Several existing human rights instruments are applicable to such spillover situations and are preferable to other kinds of regulation, as they tend to be seen as more legitimate by those adversely affected. With insights from Cambodia and Myanmar, this paper argues for a recalibration of analysis and action on climate change mitigation and land grabs that moves beyond regulation in each isolated case and toward integrated solutions."
Transportation	"A community's survival depends on trade and transportation. As competition in the global marketplace increased in the 21st century, the airport emerged as the fifth wave of transportation. The purpose of this quantitative, explanatory, quasi-experimental study was to determine the relationship between human capital development and the aerotropolis model airport performance. This study validated previous research that airports are important drivers of economic development. However, the study findings revealed a possible skills gap in the aerotropolis model. Findings also indicated cargo intensity at the aerotropolis model airport is less important to the economic success of the airport than passenger intensity."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of the population that meets or exceeds Canada's Food Guide (CFG) recommendations regarding the number of daily servings of fruits and vegetables (F/V), to assess trends in this proportion between 2000 and 2013, to estimate the annual economic burden attributable to inadequate F/V consumption within the context of other important risk factors, and to estimate the short- and long-term costs that could be avoided if modest improvements were made to F/V consumption in Canada. METHODS: We used a previously developed methodology based on population-attributable fractions and a prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach to estimate the economic burden associated with low F/V consumption. RESULTS: Over three quarters of Canadians are not meeting CFG recommendations regarding the number of daily servings of F/V, leading to an annual economic burden of $4.39 billion. If a 1% relative increase in F/V consumption occurred annually between 2013 and 2036, the cumulative reduction in economic burden over the 23-year period would reach $8.4 billion. Consumption levels of F/V, and the resulting economic burden, varied by sex, age and province. CONCLUSION: A significant majority of Canadians are not consuming the recommended daily servings of F/V, with important consequences to their health and the Canadian economy. Programs and policies are required to encourage F/V consumption in Canada."
Education & Educational Research	"This article will juxtapose the goals and implications of two pedagogical programmes that promote education for belonging in Israel. Representing the official knowledge of the Ministry of Education, the first is the 100 Concepts in Heritage, Zionism and Democracy' curriculum. The second, which embodies the counter knowledge produced and disseminated by Arab civil society organizations, is entitled Identity and Belonging: The Basic Concepts Project for Arab Pupils'. The article grapples with the attempts of Israel to impose a state-standardized version of education for belonging, as well as the active resistance to this by Arab civil society in Israel which provides an alternative one. The article argues that the concepts included in the curriculum posed by Arab civil society, albeit controversial and challenging to the very definition of Israel as both a Jewish nation state and a democracy, should be considered an act of citizenship, rather than a sign of radicalization and separatism. Indeed, the alternative curriculum constitutes a political and ethical act of in your face' democracy, which is deeply confrontational and interruptive. The paper is organized into three sections. The first explicates the politics of recognition as a theoretical framework for this study. The second unit presents both curricula and compares and contrasts the two. The third and final section offers concluding thoughts regarding the interplay of the rival Palestinian and Israeli historiographies in the struggle over canonizing and standardizing a collective narrative through the Israeli education system."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"Mixed mode designs are becoming standard in the collection of survey data. Despite this, there are still unknowns regarding how mode (e.g., Web) or mode design (e.g., sequential mixed mode) impacts measurement error. Previous research has been limited by the confounding of selection and measurement mode effects and the investigation of only one type of measurement error at a time. In this paper, we use three waves of the Understanding Society Innovation Panel to investigate whether single-mode versus sequential mixed-mode and Web versus face-to-face modes have different impacts on measurement error. We make use of a quasi-experimental design that randomly allocated respondents to either a unimode face-to-face interview or a sequential mixed-mode (Web and face-to-face) design. Through this design, we implement a new multitrait-multierror model that estimates social desirability, acquiescence, and method effects simultaneously. The results show no differences in measurement error between single modes and mode designs with respect to acquiescence and method effect but some differences are found for social desirability. We discuss the practical implications of these findings and their possible causes in conclusion."
Cultural Studies	"In the present essay, I argue that the analysis of long-neglected manuscript works from thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Castile allows us to articulate ""closeness"" as a critical tool for the study of Iberian manuscript culture in manifold ways. To begin with, the study of these incomplete or ravaged manuscripts confers a new meaning to the idea of ""close reading"" of both texts and images (consistently segregated along disciplinary lines), since scholarly work ends up being nothing short of a sleuth-like search. On the other hand, however, this minute research also forces one to explore the subtle divide between intimacy and critical distance, between the illusion of unrestricted access to the past and the theoretical discomfort provoked by the impossible task of bringing these objects back to life."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose. Understanding self concept is important for therapists treating children with cerebral palsy because knowing what children and parents think about perceived competencies and adequacies can be taken into account in determining treatment goals. This study investigated: (i) If differences existed between the self concept ratings of children with cerebral palsy compared to their parent's perception of their child's abilities and attributes, and (ii) the strength of association between the child and parent ratings. Method. Thirty children (14 females, 16 males; mean age 11 years 5 months, SD 2 years 6 months, range 8-16 years) with spastic hemiplegia or diplegia and gross motor skills classified as level I or II on the Gross Motor Function Classification System rated their self-concept using the Self-Perception Profile for Children questionnaire. Their parents completed the accompanying Parent Rating Scale. Results. Group differences between the parents and children were found for the domains of Athletic Competence and Physical Appearance. There was either no relationship or a low level of association between the child and parent ratings in all five domains of self concept assessed. Conclusion. Parents were unable to evaluate their child's self concept accurately suggesting health professionals should gather such information from the child themselves."
Law	"An estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented immigrant students graduate from high schools in the United States each year. Yet, upon reaching graduation, undocumented immigrant students, who oftentimes grew up in the United States and consider this country their home, face significant obstacles: current federal laws effectively bar access to higher education for many of these students by imposing substantial financial barriers and by preventing these students from obtaining legal residency, foreclosing federal financial aid and many career options requiring work authorization. Legislators have responded to student efforts to seek equal access to higher education by proposing the DREAM Act. This Act would remove considerable financial barriers undocumented immigrant students face in pursuing a higher education as well as establish a path to legal residency for qualifying students. The DREAM Act, however, has faced strong opposition from those who believe undocumented immigrant students should not be ""rewarded for breaking the law."" This Note proposes that current federal laws punish undocumented immigrant students by attaching culpability to an act beyond their control: entering the country illegally with their families. In response, this Note argues that due to the students' lack of culpability and lack of voluntariness in the original violation of the law the punishment of undocumented youth is not justified by popular theories of punishment."

Development Studies	"Since the early 2000s, Rwanda has implemented a comprehensive agrarian reform that makes large areas of land available to local cooperatives and foreign enterprises for investment. This article presents a case of land grabbing by the state and local elites. First, it describes the process through which Rwanda has arrived at an agricultural agenda with a productivist rationale, and reflects on the consequences for land governance. Then it explores how governmentality - as an organisational technique of power - contributes to land accumulation and peasant exploitation. The article proposes to think of land grabbing as part of authorities' governmentality and capitalist accumulation strategies."
Management	"Collective entrepreneurship (CE) is the ability of several individuals to jointly innovate and create within organisations. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether the relationship between some specific leadership styles and more effective CE is affected by moderator variables. The unit of analysis were staff members of a Portuguese group of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A total of 204 questionnaires were returned, representing almost half the employee population we approached. For measurement, we employed 19 items to gather the six latent variables related to our model. For data analysis, we used partial least squares. We found that participative leadership style had the highest joint and indirect effect on more effective CE. Job satisfaction appears to be an important moderator for the occurrence of CE. The impact of employees' organisational commitment and collaboration on CE is rather weak. Our study contributes to advancing knowledge in the fields of organisational psychology and entrepreneurship. We combine and extend previous research, which allows us to reconcile the sometimes contradictory findings so far concerning leadership and CE in the realm of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
Social Work	"Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is a widely utilized evidence-based practice for treating children exhibiting symptoms of trauma. The model is theoretically grounded in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and incorporates a safe caregiver throughout treatment. TF-CBT's use of a safe parental figure is supported by attachment theory, but the model does not fully address the complex needs of the families frequently served by social service organizations. Through the lens of attachment, the TF-CBT model holds more potential by directly supporting the parent/child bond and enhancing a caregiver's role as a secure base. As the field of neuroscience advances rapidly, new research supports attachment based interventions, and thus, also supports the importance of enhancing the parent child bond in trauma treatment. The purpose of this paper is to highlight ways that attachment theory, if made more explicit in training and education programs, could enhance clinicians' understanding and involvement of the caregiver in TF-CBT, thus making the model more applicable to families who have experienced complex, intergenerational trauma. An overview of literature related to attachment and trauma and the efficacy of TF-CBT will be provided, as well as a case illustration integrating TF-CBT and attachment principles with a highly complex family."
Development Studies	"Managed migration' schemes promote mobility of labour across international borders, diversifying worksites and introducing new systems of enacting labour consent. This article examines how Canadian franchisees are recruiting Filipino migrants to staff their restaurants, facilitating employers' access to new, flexible subjects. These workers covet their employment as pathways to Canadian citizenship. Some are unaware, however, that they are recruited under a precarious immigration scheme, one that neither directly denies nor facilitates access to legal incorporation. Instead, migrants are (transnationally) encouraged to compete in the worksite for employer-nominated citizenship, a highly productive system for engendering consent. This draws attention to new challenges managed migration' schemes pose for resisting downward pressures on work and employment conditions."
Social Work	"The purpose of the study was to analyse the assessments of elderly people aged 65 and more about family caregiving as a factor influencing their quality of life and coping. The study is based on the project SUFACARE-'Supporting family carers and care receivers in Estonia and in Finland'-in the framework of which the Institute of Social Work of Tallinn University carried out postal surveys in 2010. The Estonian survey was conducted in Tallinn and Laane-Viru County. The total number of respondents was 581 (70% female and 30% male), of whom 98 (n = 74 female and n = 24 male) were family caregivers. Caregiving has not influenced the physical and mental health of caregivers, the reason being that many people who receive care are not of very ill health or suffer from dementia. People mostly take care of their spouses. Based on the Estonian Family Law Act (RT I 2009, 60, 395), adult descendants are required to provide maintenance if their relatives are not able to care for themselves. Caregivers whose health is below average consider caring to be physically demanding. We cannot speak of the social isolation of respondents who have care duties-they communicate actively and do not feel lonely. Women report caregiving to be physically strenuous more often than men. The mental health of male caregivers is better-fewer male respondents claimed to feel unhappy or depressed compared to female respondents."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This research examines the persuasiveness of destination Web sites through an investigation of users' first impression. To achieve this goal, it builds on research by Fogg (2003) and by Kim and Fesenmaier (2007) to assess the effect of the design factors of destination Web sites on first impression formation. The results of this study indicate that the participants were able to make quick judgments on tourism Web sites and that inspiration and usability were the primary drivers evoking a favorable first impression. This research concludes by discussing the implications of these findings and possible directions for future study."
Ethnic Studies	"The question of why group-differentiated rights might be a requirement of justice has been a central focus of identity politics in recent decades. I attempt to bring some clarity to this discussion by proposing a typology to track the various ways in which individuals can be harmed or benefited as a consequence of their membership in social groups. It is the well-being of individuals that group-differentiated rights should be understood as protecting, and so clarity on the relationship between group membership and well-being is vital. One of the problems with the way in which such justifications have often been formulated in the past has been that they inadvertently position the group as a handicap to be overcome, rather than a value to be protected. I seek to overcome this limitation by clearly specifying the circumstances under which group membership is a liability, and the circumstances under which it has value. While this distinction is important, in both cases there is a relevant interest at stake, and thus the groundwork can be laid for a defence of group-differentiated rights."
Gerontology	"To examine the reliability and validity of the Aggressive Behavior Scale (ABS), derived from the Minimum Data Set (MDS 2.0). Retrospective analysis of MDS 2.0 and Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) data. Ontario nursing homes (NHs) and complex continuing care (CCC) hospitals and units. Two hundred fourteen patients of a CCC hospital, 652 residents of four NH facilities who adopted the MDS 2.0 before its mandatory implementation, 124,259 CCC patients assessed with the MDS 2.0 between July 1996 and October 2006. In all samples, trained facility clinical staff completed the MDS 2.0 as part of normal clinical practice. The ABS is a 4-item summary scale measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care. In the single CCC facility, clinical facility staff completed the CMAI during the same assessment period as the MDS 2.0. Alphas for the ABS were between 0.79 and 0.93 for the three samples. A strong relationship was found between the ABS and the aggressive subscale of the CMAI (correlation coefficient=0.72, P <.001). Impairment in cognition was found to be related to higher ABS scores in all three samples. In CCC, individuals who had higher ABS scores also had a higher prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses and greater frequency of daily restraint use (P <.001 for each dependent variable). The ABS provides a useful measure of the severity of aggressive behavior that can be used for care planning, quality measurement, and research."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"We use measures of vertex centrality to examine interlocking directorates and their economic effects in Italy. We employ centrality measures like degree, eigenvector centrality, betweenness, and flow betweenness, along with the clustering coefficient. We document the existence of a negative relationship between both degree and eigenvector centrality and firm value. Betweenness and flow betweenness, on the other hand, are not associated with lower firm valuations. We argue that these differences derive from the different properties of these measures: while degree and eigenvector centrality measures the influence and the power of the connections, betweenness and flow betweenness are proxies for the volume of information that passes between the nodes. This result is robust with respect to the use of both stock market and operating performance measures, as well as several controlling variables."
Social Work	"The topic of parental engagement in the context of child protection is of significant international interest, given much documented problems of achieving effective 'partner-ships' where professional agencies raise serious concerns about children. This article reports the findings of a qualitative study of interaction between professionals and parents in the quasi-judicial setting of pre-proceedings meetings in England. Recent legislative changes in England and Wales have aimed to improve the prospects for effective partnership work with parents through a revised pre-proceedings process. Through detailed examination of parent-professional interaction using methods of applied discourse studies, the study highlights the constraints that institutional requirements create in terms of the differential rights and obligations of parents and professionals. Inevitably, that talk is asymmetrically organized in favour of the local authority, leads to resistance on the part of parents. The study highlights problems of engaging parents who display both active and passive forms of resistance, as they seek to challenge or reject organizational goals. The study concludes with broader observations about the likely limits of legislative efforts that seek to 're-order' the complex relationships between parents and professionals in child protection work."
Ethnic Studies	"This essay analyzes the legal and spatial production of invisibility of undocumented immigrants from Mexico living in San Diego, something that Nicholas De Genova has called a ""regime of deportability"". Systematic state restrictions and a legal system that criminalizes immigrants, especially from Mexico, are in practice a racialized enforcement of the law producing a condition of permanent ""illegality"". This condition of ""illegality"" is lived through the very real possibility of being deported. To survive this environment, many undocumented immigrants from Mexico have become invisible to the rest of San Diego by relying on informal networks for information about jobs and avoiding surveillance by alerting each other about the presence of law enforcement. We focus especially on women employed in the domestic care industry, who work in private homes by the hour and use various city spaces to connect with and foster these immigrant networks. We conducted focus groups, in-depth interviews, and engaged in participant-observation in spaces such as churches, parks, buses, trolley lines, festivals, sports tournaments, and other places of reunion in North and South San Diego County. We conclude that immigrants find spaces for survival and resistance by cultivating solidarity ties through daily interactions in networks formed in public and semi-public locations."
Development Studies	"Understanding landslide processes in developing counties, coupled with community engagement can deliver landslide hazard reduction on the ground', leading to behavioural change within communities and governments. On this basis, we undertook a strategic incrementalism' approach to landslide risk reduction. The change achieved in stakeholder engagement was simultaneously a major challenge and the determinant of the project success. However, the resulting stakeholder commitment demonstrates the clear benefit of designing risk reduction measures that deliver research, on-the-ground reduction of risk and behavioural change and provides specific evidence that strategic incrementalism is a viable process.

Geography	"126 postglacial catastrophic rock-slope failures (PRSFs) and 66 debris-free failure scarps (DFFSs) were identified using Google Earth imagery on Lewisian Gneiss (LG), Torridon Sandstone (TS), Cambrian Quartzite (CQ) and Moine Schist (MS) terrains in NW Scotland. Normalisation of these data for area and gradient shows that RSF density on slopes 25 degrees decreases in the sequence MS>LG approximate to CQ>TS. Most are apparently discordant with structure, suggesting that failure along slope-(sub)parallel joints was more common than failure along bedding or foliation planes. DFFSs represent failure scars from which runout debris has been removed by later glaciation. Eighteen were recorded outside the limits of the Loch Lomond Readvance, implying that they survived the last ice-sheet glaciation, and support the view that many steep upper rock slopes have been dominated by gravity-driven rock detachment rather than glacial erosion. We argue that many RSFs were probably triggered by Lateglacial earthquakes due to fault (re)activation by crustal rebound, as 74% of recorded PRSFs and DFFSs are located at or near slope crests. 44% of recorded PRSFs and DFFSs occur in cirques, suggesting that cirque enlargement during successive glacial-interglacial cycles involved deepening by glacial erosion, headwall retreat by rock-slope failure and removal of RSF debris during subsequent glaciation."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article discusses the forthcoming diagnostic classification of Prolonged Grief Disorder in light of sociological perspectives. By placing death and grief at the center of human life and culture, the beginning pathologization of grief may be discussed in regards to contemporary societal transformations. First, it will be discussed how grief can be viewed as an emotion that in many ways is essential for our self-understanding, self-relation and relation to others. Then, through the perspective of Zygmunt Bauman, it is discussed how death, and thereby grief, can be seen as constitutive for society and culture and how medicalization has played an important role in transforming our relationship to death and grief by a process of deconstruction. This perspective is then supplemented with Hartmut Rosa's discussion of accelerating society to illuminate why grief is now a disorder that requires psychiatric treatment. The article ends with a discussion of why these tendencies are problematic in regards to our conceptualization and understanding of grief."
Cultural Studies	"This article considers live music policy in relation to wider debates on the cultural (as opposed to instrumental) value of the arts. The findings are based on research into amateur/enthusiast, state-funded and commercial concerts across a range of genres - classical, traditional folk, jazz, singer-songwriter and indie using the Edinburgh Queen's Hall venue as a case study. We argue that (1) articulations of the cultural or intrinsic value of live music across genres tend to lapse back into descriptions of instrumental value; (2) although explanations vary from audiences, artists and promoters as to why they participate in live music, they also share certain characteristics across genres and sometimes challenge stereotypes about genre-specific behaviours; and (3) there are lessons to be learned for live music policy from examining a venue that plays host to a range of genres and promotional practices."
Nursing	"The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing. (2008, October 8). Retrieved September 11, 2009, from http://www.aacn.nche.edu/Education/pdf/BaccEssentials08.pdf] addresses the importance of health promotion at the individual level across the lifespan to effect optimal population health. This qualitative study explores senior baccalaureate nursing students' perceptions (n = 85) of the teaching and learning experience related to health promotion during their pediatric clinical rotation. Four distinct learning factors of student, client, learning process, and subject matter emerged. Knowledge was enhanced, and students identified that the format of presentation influenced the quality of participant learning. Students' perception of the importance of patient and family teaching evolved over the course of the semester and highlights the importance of providing students with the tools necessary to be effective teachers and change agents to promote healthy behaviors across the lifespan. Fink's Taxonomy of Significant Learning can be applied to facilitate integrated course design for a pediatric baccalaureate nursing curriculum. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Gerontology	"Terror management theory (TMT) posits that cultural worldviews function to allay concerns about human mortality. Preliminary research with older adults has indicated that seniors do not respond to death reminders in the same way as their younger counterparts. The purpose of the current study was to test a developmentally relevant construct that may buffer death anxiety in later life. It was hypothesized that Erikson's concept of generativity may encompass death-denying properties for older adults. One hundred and seventy-nine seniors were recruited to determine if subtle mortality salience inductions would lead participants to rate their own generativity as higher than after a blatant induction, or no induction, after controlling for pre-induction generativity. As expected, participants exposed to subtle death primes rated themselves as having higher levels of generativity than the other two groups after co-varying pre-induction generativity. Explanations are discussed in light of the literatures on TMT and generativity."
Cultural Studies	"This paper contributes to accounts of the role of finance and financialization in Australia. We examine recent signs of disenchantment with financialization, then show how it is difficult to yoke contemporary instabilities in a dominant, financeled governmental regime to wider projects for change given the normalization of finance culture in Australia. The paper describes and analyzes this normalization, paying particular attention to the part various media play in Australians' acquisition of a finance rationality. While we aim to add to historicizations of finance and finance culture that interpret financialization, its various actors, its rationality and its technologies as something other than the natural habitat of people in the 21st century, we do so by looking at the problems counter-inscriptions and arguments currently face in building constituencies for alternative and oppositional finance policies."
Economics	"The paper tests whether recent theories of international trade with heterogeneous firms can explain the export patterns in Dutch firm- and plant- level data in manufacturing and services. Recent trade models with heterogeneous firms predict that the export decision of firms is affected by sunk entry costs in foreign markets, with only the most productive firms self-selecting into exports. We test a latent variable model of the export decision by probit regressions and standard OLS panel regressions. Our results support the self-selection prediction. The process further appears to be conditioned by scale effects, market structure and multinational affiliation. Regarding alternative explanations, we do not find evidence for the learning-by-exporting hypothesis, even when controlling for the firm's distance to the international productivity frontier."
Political Science	"As politics continues to be intertwined with complex, rapidly advancing bodies of knowledge, the question arises of how we are to understand the relationship between democracy and expertise. Recent discussions have focused on the capacity for democratic political institutions to address complex technical and scientific issues. These discussions have a post-positivist starting point, emphasising the contested, varied and dispersed nature of technical-scientific knowledge and expertise. Yet, as this article explores with particular reference to the work of Hayek, the sources of tension between democracy, complexity and expertise involve complex economic as well as technical-scientific dimensions. Starting from a similarly 'post-positivist' view of economic knowledge, Hayek famously concludes that over-reliance upon political expertise carries the danger of authoritarianism. He looks to the market as the most suitable institutional process for addressing complex economic choices, reflecting the various goals of individuals across society. As more recent writers have shown, this radically pro-market conclusion overlooks the profound social and environmental implications of market failure. Yet it is argued here that we can draw from the Hayekian understanding of complexity and its implications to enrich our understanding of how non-market, democratic institutions might handle those dimensions of complexity that cannot be adequately addressed through markets alone. Hence Hayekian insights can serve as an aid to re-conceptualising the concept of expertise as performing a potentially enabling role on behalf of political democracy."
Public Administration	"In the literature on system level governance of higher education, deregulation and the stepping back of government are regarded as effective measures for strengthening institutional autonomy. Based on an analysis of reforms in higher education in the Netherlands and Norway from the mid-1980s onwards, this article discusses how institutional autonomy is conditioned by reform implementation and the regulatory frameworks intended to enhance autonomy. It is argued that institutional autonomy is conditioned by the existence of systematic dialogue between the government and higher education institutions combined with regulations restricting the scope of strategic action by the institutions."
Public Administration	"The insurance sector becomes a more and more important component for the national economic and financial development. Nevertheless, the consumption and the density, both for life and non-life insurances, reveal a great variation across countries. Academic literature treats frequently the importance of the economic and demographic factors. This study evaluates the determining institutional factors of the insurance demand using OLS Multiple Regressions models on a sample of 31 European countries. The econometric estimates, according to the theory, show that a country's level of corruption is decisive for the development of the non-life insurances. For the life insurances, business freedom, fiscal freedom and government spending are the most relevant explanatory variables. The article emphasizes the mechanism through which the significant institutional factors influence the insurance density from a country."
Women'S Studies	"This essay provides the first sustained scholarly analysis of two new novels by women: Han Kang's The Vegetarian and Charlotte Wood's The Natural Way of Things. It argues that these texts, when read together, provide a crucial site for reevaluating the legacies of radical French feminist theory and ecofeminism in the late twentieth century, while also testing some of the limits of recent work in critical animal studies. In both novels, female characters pursue impossible communions with nature: in one, a woman wants to become a tree; in the other, a woman wants to become a rabbit. Kang and Wood radicalize the cultural intimacy between women and nature in exploring the potential of the natural realm-the realm outside the city, in Helene Cixous's terms, stalked by the watch-bitch, the sphinx-to serve as a refuge from a violently androcentric and anthropocentric world order. Yet the two texts ultimately refuse romanticized notions of the woman in and with nature. They dramatize the risks of a negative epistemology of vulnerability, silence, and alterity that, in different ways, conditions the radical feminist reclamation of the hysteric or madwoman as a figure of protest and the various theorizations of subversive affiliations between humans and animals in ecofeminism, feminist nature writing, and critical animal studies. This essay argues that Kang and Wood's novels reveal in contemporary feminist thought a retrospection of the debates around female madness and silence associated with second-wave feminism, especially as they reaffirm the primacy of women's relationships with other women over their being with nature."
Linguistics	"Recent Chinese trade expansion into many African countries has brought new communities of Chinese migrants into the region. In the ""China Town"" shopping centres established in the Western Cape, many employ African migrants as shop assistants. This study considers the notion of ""language policy"" as it is applied in developing a foundation for business communication in a setting where interactants have mutually unintelligible first languages and relatively low English lingua franca proficiency. Taking an ethnographic approach, this article investigates the linguistic diversity of such a market place where workers rely on English as the workplace language, developing patterns of language choice regarding which languages and styles occur in different kinds of conversational events and sequences. We focus first on the nature of the communicative practices in such a multilingual trading centre and, second, interpreting these observed practices, we indicate how an informal business language policy tacitly develops."
Gerontology	"Dementia. is one of the greatest contemporary health and social care challenges, and novel approaches to the care of its sufferers are needed. New information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to assist those caring for people with dementia, through access to networked information and support, tracking and surveillance. This article reports the views about such new technologies of 34 carers of people with dementia. We also held a group discussion with nine carers for respondent validation. The carers' actual use of new ICT was limited, although they thought a gradual increase in the use of networked technology in dementia care was inevitable but would bypass some carers who saw themselves as too old. Carers expressed a general enthusiasm for the benefits of ICT, but usually not for themselves, and they identified several key challenges including: establishing an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, privacy and autonomy and, on the other: maximising safety; establishing responsibility for and ownership of the equipment and who bears the costs; the possibility that technological help would mean a loss of valued personal contact; and the possibility that technology would substitute for existing services rather than be complementary. For carers and dementia sufferers to be supported, the expanding use of these technologies should be accompanied by intensive debate of the associated issues."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This article engages critically with the comparative employment relations literature, assessing its capacity to explain and analyse the relationship between state objectives - accumulation, pacification, legitimation - and employment relations. Having engaged with approaches that have influenced the discipline in recent decades, it draws on insights from capitalist Southeast Asia to identify determining factors not accounted for in comparative employment relations models developed from and applied to the Global North. These include the relatively high degree of fluidity in forms of governance characteristic of contexts where there is a dynamic interplay between democratic and authoritarian rule, which challenges the assumption that employment relations are underpinned by a relatively strong, stable and autonomous state. Equally significant is the impact of inter-state and international interests and influences, only some of which are economic, on the balance between different state objectives as they pertain to employment relations."
Law	"The U.S. Endangered Species Act requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to use the ""best available"" information when deciding whether to list species as threatened or endangered, and when regulating conservation for species already listed. The agency has discretion to determine the types, quantity, and quality of the information it uses as ""best available,"" but little discretion to defer decision making in cases where important scientific information is lacking. Complexities of nature, obscurity of many species' life history, and changing environmental circumstances are only some of the reasons why information is rarely complete, and why decisions are almost always made in the face of uncertainties. These uncertainties could lead to decision errors and the consequences might be failure to prevent extinction or imposition of unnecessary regulatory requirements. Furthermore, real or perceived errors could lead to legal action and loss of the agency's credibility. This Paper discusses some recent examples of how the Fish and Wildlife Service has dealt explicitly with uncertainty in its administration of the Endangered Species Act."
Development Studies	"Recruiting and retaining participants is critical to determine the impacts and cost-effectiveness of behavioural change programmes. This article reports on the main issues that influenced participants' recruitment and participation in a pilot Australian energy behaviour change programme for low-income participants. Results indicated that recruitment was more effective if low-income participants were recruited through participants' social networks, promoted by word of mouth and if logistical barriers were removed. Results also show that potential financial savings was the main driver for low-income individuals to participate in the programme, with environmental motivations as a second reason for participation."
Nursing	"In the United Kingdom over 90% of women do not breastfeed for as long as they would like, despite widespread knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding. Negative attitudes and low levels of knowledge in staff supporting breastfeeding may be a contributing factor. This paper reports on the breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes in two key workforce groups; student midwives (n = 19) and Breastfeeding Network peer supporters (n = 36) and compares them with breastfeeding women (n = 23). All three groups had high knowledge and attitude scores, but peer supporters had significantly higher levels than student midwives or breastfeeding women. Student midwives' knowledge of breastfeeding was higher than breastfeeding women's but they had similar breastfeeding attitude scores. The higher knowledge and attitude scores in peer supporters may be attributed to the effectiveness of their training, which includes challenging their existing breastfeeding attitudes and debriefing their personal breastfeeding experience. It is suggested that midwives' breastfeeding attitudes are affected by their community culture and their personal experience of breastfeeding. It is proposed that midwifery training should continue to embrace a biopsychosocial model, including training to improve breastfeeding attitudes, particularly for professionals from areas where breastfeeding is not the cultural norm, or who have had negative personal breastfeeding experiences.

Public Administration	"This article examines the effects of the structure of intermunicipal cooperatives (IMCs) on the perceived transaction costs and benefits of IMCs. Hypotheses based on a polycentric theory of regional governance are tested using data from Dutch municipalities. The findings are mixed. In line with polycentric theory, networks characterized by a multiplicity of territorial scales reduce IMC transaction costs. Contrary to polycentric theory, however, if IMCs are organized under a uniform legal regime, lower costs and higher benefits are reported. Structural factors that dominate the debate between polycentrism and monocentrism prove to be of limited importance. On the other hand, the results indicate support for the hypotheses that intermunicipal trust (as a cultural variable) contributes to perceptions of effective and efficient cooperation. Evidence for Practice An undiscriminating reduction of network complexity (by imposing a fixed or limited set of cooperative partners) does not improve the functional performance of regional governance. Variety in cooperative partners appears to reduce the costs of cooperation but does not result in higher benefits. A consistent uniform regulatory regime that creates a set of rules on how to organize decision making and representation in intermunicipal cooperation increases functional performance of cooperation. Structural factors indicating how cooperation is organized play a minor role in explaining functional performance or cooperation. The cooperative climate (indicated by the level of trust) plays a more important role. Trust comes with lower levels of costs and higher levels of regional benefits but does not influence local benefits for individual municipalities."
Urban Studies	"In a recent paper published in this journal, Gordon Mulligan has presented a methodology for better understanding the general pattern of urbanization, familiar as an S-shaped curve.

Our commentary suggests that the upper limit and speed of change of the urbanization process should be revisited. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Demography	"In developing countries, women are 3.5 times more likely than men to participate in unpaid work. As a traditionally patriarchal society, strict gender roles existed in Iran but there is no empirical evidence to show whether profound socio-economic and demographic changes in the society have altered these deep-rooted stratified gender roles. This paper uses data from the 2014-2015 Time Use Survey, conducted in the urban areas of Iran, to describe the spouses"" division of household labour and determine the correlates of this division. The correlates are selected based on the relative resources and time availability approaches. The results suggest that wives are five times more likely than husbands to participate in the household labour, which is wider than the average gender gap observed in developing countries. The findings provide partial support for the relative resources and time availability approaches, with wives"" experience being more consistent with these approaches. The existing profound gender gap in the division of household labour and its correlates suggests that in urban areas of Iran gender roles are defined beyond socio-economic and demographic attributes, at least on the individual level."
Communication	"The rise of sophisticated tools for tracking audiences online has begun to change the way media producers think about media audiences. This study examines this phenomenon in journalism, building on a revised theoretical model that accounts for greater audience engagement in the gatekeeping process. Research suggests that news editors, after long resisting or ignoring audience preferences, are becoming increasingly aware of and adaptive to consumer tastes as manifest via metrics. However, research also finds a gap in the news preferences of editors and audiences. This study asks: Who influences whom more in this disparity? Through longitudinal secondary data analysis of three U.S. online newspapers, and using structural equation modeling, this study finds that (a) audience clicks affect subsequent news placement, based on time-lagged analysis; (b) such influence intensifies during the course of the day; (c) there is no overall lagged effect of news placement on audience clicks; and (d) the lagged effect of audience clicks on news placement is stronger than the inverse. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed."
History	"Can one write a visual history' of the family? This article is a preliminary attempt to explore the relationship between visuals and history and how this is configured in relation to an institution like the family. By examining a diverse set of Indian images, ranging from Company art, Kalighat prints, realist portraiture and some photography, I wish to problematise the relationship between representation and history. A chief interest in this exploration is to see how the visual effects exceed the illustrative, and how that transforms our understanding of the subject' in question, in this instance, understanding the family conceptually."
Substance Abuse	"Introduction and Aims. Australian pharmacotherapy maintenance programs incur costs to patients. These dispensing fees represent a financial burden to patients and are inconsistent with Australian health-care principles. No previous work has examined the current costs nor the future predicted costs if government subsidised dispensing fees. Design and Methods. A system dynamics model, which simulated the flow of patients into and out of methadone maintenance treatment, was developed. Costs were imputed from existing research data. The approach enabled simulation of possible behavioural responses to a fee subsidy (such as higher retention) and new estimates of costs were derived under such scenarios. Results. Current modelled costs (AUS$11.73m per month) were largely borne by state/territory government (43%), with patients bearing one-third (33%) of the total costs and the Commonwealth one-quarter (24%). Assuming no behavioural changes associated with fee subsidies, the cost of subsidising the dispensing fees of Australian methadone patients would be $3.9m per month. If retention were improved as a result of fee subsidy, treatment numbers would increase and the model estimates an additional cost of $0.8m per month. If this was coupled with greater numbers entering treatment, the costs would increase by a further $0.4m per month. In total, full fee subsidy with modelled behavioural changes would increase per annum government expenditure by $81.8m to $175.8m. Discussion and Conclusions. If government provided dispensing fee relief for methadone maintenance patients, it would be a costly exercise. However, these additional costs are offset by the social and health gains achieved from the methadone maintenance program.[Chalmers J, Ritter A. Subsidising patient dispensing fees: The cost of injecting equity into the opioid pharmacotherapy maintenance system. Drug Alcohol Rev 2012;31:911917]"
Public Administration	"Comparative policy analysis sometimes relies on the use of metrics to foster policy learning. We compare health care for patients at the end of life (EOL) in the US and France. The analysis aims to enable policy makers in both nations to reexamine their own health systems in light of how their counterparts are responding to common concerns about the intensity, quality and cost of EOL care. We find that a higher percentage of French decedents 65 years and over, are hospitalized, yet they spend fewer days in intensive care units (ICUs) than their counterparts for whom data are available (Medicare beneficiaries) in the US. In addition, decedents in the US consult with a higher number of different physicians than their French counterparts. We also compare patterns of hospital use for decedents in EOL care among academic medical centers (AMCs) in the US and France. We find greater variation among French AMCs than among their counterparts in the US."
Demography	Social exclusion and violence are phenomena intertwined in different ways. The current article seeks to explore one of this articulations happening at the household. Reflections are based on the data provided by a household survey applied in several urban communities in Costa Rica and El Salvador. The analysis shows how social exclusion is projected within the household generating violence which affects not only family members but also other members of the community.
History Of Social Sciences	"This paper traces the relationship between state development policies and planning Tehran's urban development from 1945 until the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It shows how the geopolitical context of the Cold War, and the political agendas of multilateral and bilateral development agencies (i.e. the World Bank and the Ford Foundation), together with the specific circumstances of the national modernization of Iran, were decisive in shaping the Iranian planning administration and the emergence of a comprehensive master planning approach. Moreover, this study demonstrates the critical role of the Iranian technocratic elite and professional middle class in establishing planning institutions and advocating for a vision of progress and development. The focus here is on the formation of the 'Plan Organization' as the first modern planning institution in Iran, and the ways in which this institution played a key role in shaping Iranian expert culture and urban planning practices. By examining the links between national development policies and urban planning, this paper presents how comprehensive master planning emerged as the preferred model for the planning and development of Iranian cities. The focus here is on the design and implementation of Tehran's 1968 Comprehensive Master Plan."
Management	"Environmental supply chain management (SCM) initiatives often evolve as informal, grassroots efforts that are driven by policy entrepreneurs at lower management levels in an organization. These individuals usually are not in positions of power or authority to convince others to support the initiative. They thus rely on central positions in informal networks to gain access to and influence over other employees to be better able to sell these initiatives. This study examines how individuals arrive at positions of centrality within the networks surrounding environmental SCM initiatives. Linking social network theory and social capital theory with findings from the organizational behavior and environmental arena, the study investigates how an individual's proactive personality and commitment profileaffective, normative, and continuance commitmentmight affect network centrality through the mediating role of championing behavior. Investigating the implementation of an environmental SCM initiative at a multinational enterprise, the authors identified a 90-actor social network surrounding the initiative. The results provide evidence that championing behavior fully mediates the relationship between commitment and network centrality and to a lesser extent between proactive personality and network centrality. These findings suggest that championing behavior can enable an actor to become more central in social networks. Further, the results indicate that in an environmental SCM context, engendering the right type of commitment is a much more important driver of championing behavior than the proactive personalities of individual actors. This finding suggests that even employees who do not have proactive personalities can champion environmental initiatives and become central within the informal networks that surround these initiatives, if they strongly desire to support the initiative and believe that the initiative will lead to positive change."
Linguistics	"Whole-word frequency effects are shown to exist in what appears to be a completely regular system, the spelling of prefix-final vertical bar z vertical bar in Russian. Russian prefixes that underlyingly end in vertical bar z vertical bar (roz-, bez-, iz-) end in [s] on the surface when followed by a voiceless consonant. According to the rules of Russian orthography, the surface form, rather than the underlying form, must be reflected in the spelling. However, spelling errors reflecting the underlying form often occur, especially for the prefix bez-. The present paper reports that the error rate, either in natural typing on the web or in a classroom dictation task, for a given word is negatively correlated with the frequency of the word, suggesting that Russian writers rely, to a significant extent, on memory of complete orthographic forms as opposed to the orthographic rule. The frequency effect holds even within the set of regular inflectional variants of a single lexeme, with more frequent wordforms showing lower error rates. The evidence demonstrates a high degree of reliance on whole-form lexical retrieval even in what appears to be a regular system that is explicitly taught to the writers throughout their schooling in a morphologically rich language and thus provides support for the use of lexical retrieval even when it is not necessary (Baayen et al. 2002, Butter-worth 1983, Bybee 1985, 2000, vs. DiSciullo and Williams 1987, Pinker 1991). However, reliance on retrieval is argued to be especially strong when there is a relatively long period of temporary uncertainty regarding which rule is applicable during processing (see also Albright 2009, Barca et al. 2007, Burani et al. 2006). The importance of temporary uncertainty and resulting rule competition suggests that the regular/irregular distinction needs to be reconsidered as even fully ""regular"" systems may feature rule competition due to temporary uncertainties about rule applicability. Reliance on retrieval may go largely undetected in Russian during schooling because teaching and test materials focus on the spelling of frequent words, which can be either produced by rule or retrieved as wholes. The largely complementary methodological challenges in studying lexical frequency effects in corpus and experimental data are discussed."
Education & Educational Research	"Student participation in school decision-making and reform processes has taken inspiration from reconceptualisations of childhood. Advocates for student voice argue for the repositioning of children and young people in relation to adults in schools. This article works with data from a multi-sited case study of three primary schools and students', teachers' and school leaders' accounts of their student voice practices. We consider the relationships between students in student voice activities in primary schools, and the possibilities and ambivalences of representative students 'speaking for' other students. We integrate recent insights from moves beyond voice in childhood studies, and from the turn to listening in cultural studies, and raise questions for students, teachers and researchers who seek to encourage student voice in primary schooling."
Geography	"A long tradition of feminist and postcolonial scholarship has insisted on the centrality of social difference to regimes of capital accumulation. This article examines abnormality-one half of a binary categorization that evaluates bodies in relation to their success or failure in terms of health, productivity, and mental or physical capacity-as one such form of social difference. I examine the relationship between abnormality and capitalist value production from the vantage of the abnormal in vitro fertilization embryo. Although exceedingly difficult to commodify, abnormal embryos are multiply oriented to capital, caught up in circuits of value generation as living tools in the development of new (and promissory) biomedical knowledges, products, and profits. Abnormality, I argue, functions to smooth embryos"" entry into the tissue economy by severing their ties to full human life, potentiating new regimes of capital accumulation as it does so. Although emphatically different from the forms of dehumanization to which racialized, gendered, and colonial others are subject-not least because embryos are not full human life-abnormal embryos demonstrate, in very literal fashion, how the production of social difference operates to distribute life itself in ways that enable new accumulation strategies. This research is based on observations and interviews conducted at fertility clinics, scientific expos, embryo research labs, and reproductive medicine conferences in the United States between 2016 and 2018."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Much of the existent research presents perceived social support as an effective tool of stress management at work. Our research aims to test this hypothesis by interrogating the moderator role attributed to perceived social support from superiors and subordinates in the relationship between role conflict and stress among middle managers (MI) and proximity managers (MP) in the public sector. The job demands-resources model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) serves as a theoretical framework. According to this model, perceived social support is a professional resource that can help to mitigate the adverse effects of job demands on mental health. The data collected from 310 managers in local public administration only partially confirm this hypothesis. Indeed, our research does not initially support the moderating influence of perceived social support from supervisors and subordinates in the relationship between role conflict and perceived stress among MI. Similar results are observed in some cases among MP. Consequently, the idea of non-mobilization of social support as a professional resource for managers in certain conditions is put forward in discussing these results. The results show that the effectiveness of perceived social support depends on several factors: the nature and the source of the perceived social support, the type of role conflict and the status of the managers concerned (MI and MP). Hence, the MP seem to be more receptive than the MI to the social support of their supervisors when facing role conflicts and, as a result, their stress levels decrease. In order to manage the stress of MP caused by role conflicts, their professional skills need to be recognized."
Management	"We show that U.S. stock and Treasury futures prices respond sharply to recurring stale information releases: In particular, we identify a unique macroeconomic series-the U.S. Leading Economic Index (R) (LET)-which is released monthly and constructed as a summary statistic of previously released inputs. We show that a front-running strategy that trades S&P 500 futures in the direction of the announcement a day before its release and then trades in the opposite direction of the announcement following its release generates an average annual return of close to 8%. These patterns are more pronounced for high beta stocks, for stocks that are more difficult to arbitrage, and during times when investors' sensitivity to firm-specific stale information is high. Treasury futures exhibit similar, albeit less pronounced, price patterns. Other measures of information arrival, such as price volatility and volume, spike following the release. These empirical findings suggest that some investors are inattentive to the stale nature of the information included in the LEI releases, instead interpreting it as new information, and thereby causing temporary yet significant mispricing."
Transportation	"Public transit systems in the United States often face multiple policy objectives. Typically, stakeholders desire frequent service on an extensive network, but funding and other resources are constrained, creating complicated relationships between service effectiveness goals and business efficiency goals. Using data from the National Transit Map (NTM), this study evaluated the general performance of transit systems across 294 Urbanized Areas (UZAs) in the US, which were stratified into six peer groups based on population. Transit efficiency and effectiveness were compared by developing a composite business efficiency index score and a composite service effectiveness index score for each urbanized area. The scores were generated using a fuzzy logic extension of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which allows automated weighting of the measures. The NTM currently includes a limited set of performance measures, and each transit agency's data are associated with the largest urban area it serves; consequently, it is perhaps best-suited for identifying high-performing UZAs and less suitable for identifying the weakest performers. The analytical results suggest that a few UZAs (mainly densely-populated cities and university towns) are simultaneously able to achieve high scores on both business efficiency and service effectiveness. In most small- and medium-size conurbations, business efficiency appears to be a higher policy priority than service effectiveness."
Gerontology	"Objectives To analyze self-reported changes in physical function in older women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Design Secondary analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907 prospective randomized clinical trial. Setting CALGB institutions in the United States. Participants Women aged 65 and older with Stage I to III breast cancer enrolled in CALGB 49907 who had physical function data from before and after receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (N=256; mean age 71.5, range 65-85). Measurements Participants were administered the physical function subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire before chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and 12 months after chemotherapy initiation. Functional decline was defined as a more than 10-point decrease from baseline at each time point. Resilience was defined as return to within 10 points of baseline. Multivariable regression was used to examine pretreatment characteristics associated with physical function changes. Results Of 42% of participants who had physical function decline from before to the end of chemotherapy, 47% recovered by 12 months (were resilient). Almost one-third experienced functional decline from before chemotherapy to 12 months later. Pretreatment fatigue was a risk factor for functional decline from before to the end of chemotherapy (P=.02). Risk factors for functional decline at 12 months included pretreatment dyspnea (P=.007) and being unmarried (P=.01). Conclusion Functional decline was common in older women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in a clinical trial. Although half recovered their physical function, one-third had a clinically meaningful decline at 12 months. Strategies are needed to prevent functional decline in older adults receiving chemotherapy. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:920-927, 2019."
Ethnic Studies	"Though nationhood is typically understood to be an equalizing or horizontal concept, the phenomenon of ethnic return migration has shown that states as well as societies can draw hierarchical distinctions between persons of the same ancestry. We demonstrate two dimensions - legal and social - of this 'hierarchical nationhood' by analysing the South Korean policy and citizen attitudes regarding Joseonjok, or ethnic Korean Chinese citizens moving to South Korea. On the legal dimension, the Korean state defines Joseonjok as foreigners, allowing them entry mainly for low-wage jobs and excluding them from social benefits, while preferring them over other foreigners. The legal dimension of hierarchy is also institutionalized in a more favourable visa for Korean Americans that excludes Joseonjok. The social dimension of hierarchical nationhood is shown by public opinion data of Korean citizens towards Joseonjok foreign workers and data on reported experiences of discrimination. Finally, the authors show how Korea's hierarchical nationhood is shaped by economic and geopolitical goals, and describe analogous cases in Asia and Europe."
Management	"Maturity models can improve the effectiveness and capability of the organizations. However, the existing maturity models are only for one single organization and cannot deal with the specific problems of mega construction programs (MCPs) in China. The program management subjects of MCPs in China consist of the owner, the general design contractor, and the general construction contractor, which are not mature in the organizational management and process management. This paper presents a program management organization maturity integrated model for MCPs (PMOMIM-MCPs) in China, which integrates the program management subjects of MCPs and can improve the capability of them. Two submodels of PMOMIM-MCPs Organizational Management Submodel (OMS) and Process Management Submodel (PMS) are given. In the end, a case study is given to justify and optimize the model.

Geography	"In this article we use the natural lab of music festivals to examine behavioral change in response to the rapid introduction of smart surveillance technology into formerly unpoliced spaces. Festivals are liminal spaces, free from the governance of everyday social norms and regulations, permitting participants to assert a desired self. Due to a number of recent festival deaths, drug confiscations, pickpockets, and a terroristic mass shooting, festivals have quickly introduced smart security measures such as drones and facial recognition technologies. Such a rapid introduction contrasts with urban spaces where surveillance is introduced gradually and unnoticeably. In this article we use some findings from an online survey of festivalgoers to reveal explicit attitudes and experiences of surveillance. We found that surveillance is often discomforting because it changes experience of place, it diminishes feelings of safety, and bottom-up measures (health tents, being in contact with friends) are preferred to top-down surveillance. We also found marked variation between men, women, and nonbinary people?s feelings toward surveillance. Men were much less affected by surveillance. Women have very mixed views on surveillance; they simultaneously have greater safety concerns (especially sexual assault in public) and are keener on surveillance than men but also feel that it is ineffective in preventing assault (but might be useful in providing evidence subsequently). Our findings have significant ramifications for the efficacy of a one-size-fits-all solution of increased surveillance and security in smart places and cities and point to the need for more bottom-up safety measures. Key Words: anxiety, festivals, smart city, surveillance, well-being."
Anthropology	"Growth, development, and decline of the human skeleton are of central importance to physical anthropology. All processes of skeletal growth (longitudinal growth as well as gains and losses of bone mass) are subjected to environmental and genetic influences. These influences, and their relative contributions to the phenotype, can be asserted at any stage of life. We present here the gross phenotypic and genetic landscapes of four skeletal traits, and show how they vary across the life span. Phenotypic sex differences are found in bone diameter and cortical index (a ratio of cortical thickness over bone diameter) at a very early age and continue throughout most of life. Sexual dimorphism in summed cortical thickness and bone length, however, is not evident until shortly after the pubertal growth spurt. Genetic contributions (heritability) to these skeletal phenotypes are generally moderate to high. Bone length and bone diameter (which both scale with body size) tend to have the highest heritability, with heritability of bone length fairly stable across ages (with a notable dip in early childhood) and that of bone diameter peaking in early childhood. The bone traits summed cortical thickness and cortical index that may better reflect bone mass, a more plastic phenomenon, have slightly lower genetic influences, on average. Results from our phenotypic and genetic landscapes serve three key purposes: 1) demonstration of the integrated nature of the genetic and environmental underpinnings of skeletal form, 2) identification of periods of bone's relative sensitivity to genetic and environmental influences, 3) and stimulation of hypotheses predicting the effects of exposure to environmental variables on the skeleton, given variation in the underlying genetic architecture.

"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This conceptual paper contributes to tourism knowledge by proposing a spirituality-based platform in tourism higher education. Through this platform, the authors show how tourism education that supports discussion on spiritual development can help to create global citizens who are able to understand their potential as social, cultural and environmental stewards. This paper reviews recent developments shaping tourism education and examines the contemporary tourism educational landscape that supports a spirituality-based educational approach. The 7th platform of tourism studies is offered through a spirituality-based approach to knowledge and examples are given of how we can develop such a platform in tourism higher education."
Linguistics	"This article reports the findings of a controlled quasi-experimental study investigating the effects of motivational strategies on learner motivation and achievement in English language classes in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the most important motivational strategies were identified. In the second stage, 437 learners divided almost equally into two groups (experimental vs. control) and 14 English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers were recruited. Motivational strategies targeting the situation-specific motivational disposition of learners were implemented in the treatment group for approximately 10 weeks. Three instruments were used to assess teacher motivational practices and learner motivation levels before and after treatment. Learner achievement was measured three times during the study period. Statistical analyses (e.g. analysis of covariance and mediation analysis) were used to evaluate the study findings. These findings revealed that the motivational intervention in the experimental group led to increased learner motivation, which in turn led to higher achievement levels for learners in the experimental group than for those in the control group."
Health Policy & Services	"People with disabilities comprise roughly 25% of the U.S. adult population yet remain underrepresented in mainstream public health and evaluation research. The lack of measures of common constructs that are validated in but not specific to this population may impede their inclusion. This article describes the use of Universal Design for Measurement (UDM), a novel method for developing self-report measurement instruments validated among broad populations to minimize the need for scale adaptation. We applied UDM to the development and content validation of a new body image scale. We assessed content validity by surveying subject matter experts (SMEs) and conducted a Delphi panel study to assess consensus about scale items among community women with (n = 18) and without (n = 15) disabilities. Most scale items were found acceptable by SMEs and community women. The Delphi panel study was useful toward evaluating consensus about scale items among women with and without disabilities. Findings support the use of UDM in developing inclusive and psychometrically sound measurement scales to ultimately facilitate the full inclusion of people with disabilities within health research."

Development Studies	"Global Value Chain (GVC) proponents argue that regional and human development can be achieved through strategic coupling' with transnational corporations. This argument is misleading for two reasons. First, GVC abstracts firm-firm and firm-state relations from their class-relational basis, obscuring fundamental developmental processes. Second, much GVC analysis promotes linear conceptions of development. This article provides a class-relational framework for GVC analysis. The formation and functioning of GVCs and the developmental effects associated with them are products of histories of evolving, and often conflictive, class relations. A study of export fruiticulture in Northeast Brazil provides empirical support for these arguments."
Rehabilitation	"Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder. One of the most disabling clinical problems of affected women is pain syndrome which presenting with dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. Sexual dysfunction is one of the health problems is these women which is not regarded as it should be. The goal of this study was to evaluate sexual function in Iranian women with endometriosis in comparison with healthy controls. Forty-six married women with confirmed endometriosis and 80 healthy subjects enrolled. Participants were asked to answer the valid and reliable Persian version of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. The most common clinical symptom were dysmenorrheal and dyspareunia. The mean Visual Analogue Scale for pain during sex was 37.4 +/- A 35.7 and mean sexual activity satisfaction was 64.4 +/- A 33.6 %. Total FSFI score and scores of three out of six subscales (arousal, orgasm and pain) were significantly different between patients and controls. By considering 26.55 as cut off point, we found that education level and body mass index (BMI) were significantly different in patients with and without sexual dysfunction. BMI was the independent predictor for total FSFI score in both case and control groups. Iranian women with endometriosis exhibited significant dysfunction in most domains of FSFI questionnaire. So, sexual dysfunction should be considered in Iranian women with endometriosis."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"This paper reports on research into protection for migrant workers under evolving occupational health and safety (OHS) regimes in China. China has made huge efforts in modernizing its OHS regime by unifying occupational health and safety administration. Its current OHS regime can be categorized as a direct state regulation model based on worker citizenship theory. The lack of effective collective bargaining mechanisms on the participation rights dimension and the gendered and aged-based approach on the social rights dimension render current OHS regimes less effective in protecting migrant workers. As a regime of direct state regulation, its performance will hinge on the level of enforcement, which has to compete with economic initiatives on the government's agenda. These weaknesses will produce disproportionately adverse impacts on migrant workers."
Linguistics	"At his death in April 2014, Stephen Hester left behind an unfinished manuscript of a book, entitled ""Descriptions of Deviance"". In this book he takes an MCA approach to examining how categorial formulations of deviance are interactionally constructed and negotiated in talk in educational settings. The data comprise transcriptions of pupil review meetings involving teachers and educational psychologists in an education authority in Northern England. In analysing this data, and consistent with the approach he had championed throughout his career, Hester emphasises the occasionality of categorial formulations. Recognising that this emphasis is not unproblematic and requires careful consideration, before turning to the data he discusses the problem of ""culturalism"". He argues that Sacks"" distinction between ""occasioned"" and ""natural"" category devices does not lend support to the culturalist view of category use. Furthermore, while Schegloff""s cautions concerning the methodological pitfalls of MCA are serious and well made, the analysis of categorial data, especially texts, need not fall into the trap of ""culturalism"".

Development Studies	"This article discusses the assumptions underlying state-building efforts and the effects of these efforts. It addresses two main questions: why has state building not led to the establishment of effective states? And what are the effects of statebuilding? It is argued that these efforts have been based on an institutionalist model of the state derived from a Weberian framework, and that the basic reason why state building has failed is that the creation of effective states requires the creation of state-centred societies, where both material and symbolic resources are concentrated in the state. This is very difficult to achieve for external actors. But, although state building has not achieved the kinds of effects associated with effective states, it has nevertheless had significant effects. These include, first, accentuating the patrimonialism which has led to state weakness in the first place; second, reductions in national sovereignty as external actors' substantial influence on policy agendas renders the state itself subject to control and regulation by actors external to it; and, third, perpetuating the idea of the state, while undermining the possibility of creating actual states which conform to this idea."
Demography	"The marginalization within the Otomi ethno-region of the State of Mexico is unevenly distributed between indigenous and non-indigenous, being the first group in a more unfavorable condition. In other words, poverty, lack of educational and employment opportunities, lack of services and social rights, etc. are distributed not only on the basis of social class to which they belong but are accentuated with the belonging of a particular ethnic group. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to expose various sociodemographic indicators of the Otomi people of the State of Mexico, in order to show the conditions of disadvantage compared to non-indigenous population despite belonging to the same municipalities and ethno-region."
Linguistics	"This study examines word order variation in negative word + mas constructions in Caracas Spanish, with mas pre-posed or post-posed in relation to the negative word. We empirically analyze the effect of formal syntactic and semantic constraints, the contribution of priming and frequency, as well as several social factors on variable positioning of mas in NW + mas constructions in Spanish. Data for this study comes from the Estudio sociolinguistico de Caracas (Bentivoglio and Sedano 1993). This corpus contains half-hour interviews, conducted between 1987 and 1988 with 160 speakers of Caracas Spanish. Regarding the role of syntactic and semantic formal constraints in the variation of NW + mas constructions, the findings reveal that only polarity and the position of the NW + mas construction relative to the verb significantly constrained variation between pre-posed and post-posed NW + mas constructions. Garcia Cornejo (2008) and Gutierrez-Rexach and Gonzalez-Rivera (2012, 2014) argued that pre-posed mas only occurs with purely negative uses of these constructions. While our results are consistent with this observation, we also found that this pattern is not categorical, since pre-posed mas is used in 34.3% of affirmative sentences. In order to address variation not explained by formal analyses, we explore the role of frequency to account for the variable position of mas + NW. Frequency appears to be a factor in this variation: the most frequent NW + mas construction, with nada, showed the highest rate of post-posing and lowest rate of pre-posing. Priming did not have a significant effect, although it trends in the expected direction: in contexts with a pre-posed prime, the rate of pre-posed mas was higher (58.3%). We argue that analogical levelling with other pre-posed mas constructions has led to an increased use of pre-posed NW + mas constructions in Caracas Spanish and that the most frequent construction, nada mas, is resisting this analogical change due to its higher frequency and consequential entrenchment."
Law	"Artificial intelligence (""AI"") is a transformative technology that has radically altered decision-making processes. Evaluating the case for algorithmic or automated decision-making (""ADM"") platforms requires navigating tensions between two normative concerns. On the one hand, ADM platforms may lead to more efficient, accurate, and objective decisions. On the other hand, early and disturbing evidence suggests ADM platform results may demonstrate biases, undermining claims that this special class of algorithms will democratize markets and increase inclusion. State law assigns decision-making authority to the boards of directors of corporations. State courts and lawmakers accord significant deference to the board in the execution of its duties. Among its duties, a board must employ effective oversight policies and procedures to manage known risks. Consequently, the board of directors and senior management of firms integrating ADM platforms must monitor operations to mitigate enterprise risks including litigation, reputation, compliance, and regulatory risks that arise as a result of the integration of algorithms. After the recent financial crisis, firms adopted structural and procedural governance reforms to mitigate various enterprise risks; these approaches may prove valuable in mitigating the risk of algorithmic bias. Evidence demonstrates that heterogeneous teams may identify and mitigate risks more successfully than homogeneous teams. Heterogeneous teams are more likely to overcome cognitive biases such as confirmation, commitment, overconfidence, and relational biases. This Article argues that increasing gender inclusion in the development of AI technologies will introduce important and diverse perspectives, reduce the influence of cognitive biases in the design, training, and oversight of learning algorithms, and, thereby, mitigate bias-related risk management concerns."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"This paper explores the dynamics of hotel innovation and its impact on hotel performance with a representative sample of the whole hotel sector operating in the Balearic Islands, Spain. The managers of sampled hotels (N=331) answered questions about innovations over a 6-year period. On the basis of an earlier developed model of innovation types, we investigate the effect on performance of different types of innovation. We find that two combinations of innovation types impact hotel performance in a positive way, namely the combinations termed, Full and Service&Back-Office innovation. We therefore suggest that these combinations are used to create synergies for hotel performance. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Substance Abuse	"Differences on expectancies and self-efficacy between college females who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED) and non-RED were examined. Students (N = 95) from Southern California filled out the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol, Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events, and Drinking Context Convivial Drinking scales as well as self-efficacy, alcohol use, and demographic items in the fall semester of 2008. Logistic and linear regression showed that greater positive expectancies and lower self-efficacy were predictive of categorization as RED and greater convivial drinking. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Although health personnel today have to relate to numerous different patients and patient roles, patients have tended to be viewed as either active or passive. In this paper, we investigate how one unique patient was able to defy advice from his doctors and nurses yet maintain viable relationships with them. We argue that this patient's ability to draw on heterogeneous resources may have made his unusual trajectory possible. On the basis of interviews with relevant health personnel and the concept of sensemaking, we elaborate on how relationships between health personnel and patients emerge from a complex network of ICT, power and third-party actors. We conclude that the active patient is an emergent relationship rather than a singular entity of knowledge and power."
Nursing	"Mobile health platforms offer significant opportunities for improving diabetic self-care, but only if adequate usability exists. Expert evaluations such as heuristic evaluation can provide distinct usability information about systems. The purpose of this study was to complete a usability evaluation of a mobile health system for diabetes patients using a modified heuristic evaluation technique of (1) dual-domain experts (healthcare professionals, usability experts), (2) validated scenarios and user tasks related to patients' self-care, and (3) in-depth severity factor ratings. Experts identified 129 usability problems with 274 heuristic violations for the system. The categories Consistency and Standards dominated at 24.1% (n = 66), followed by Match Between System and Real World at 22.3% (n = 61). Average severity ratings across system views were 2.8 (of 4), with 9.3% (n = 12) rated as catastrophic and 53.5% (n = 69) as major. The large volume of violations with severe ratings indicated clear priorities for redesign. The modified heuristic approach allowed evaluators to identify unique and important issues, including ones related to self-management and patient safety. This article provides a template for one type of expert evaluation adding to the informaticists' toolbox when needing to conduct a fast, resource-efficient and user-oriented heuristic evaluation."
Family Studies	"Research suggests that child perception of parenting styles may strongly influence child outcomes and parents must balance support and structure based on their emerging adult children's changing needs. The current study examined emerging adult perceptions of parenting style in comparison with their preferences and how these characteristics interact to predict psychological problems. Significant interactions between preferred and perceived parenting style were found, several of which were further moderated by gender. Results suggest that emerging adults prefer parenting styles that grant autonomy, and males reported lower psychological problems when they also perceived such a parenting style, whereas females reported higher psychological problems. This may suggest that females experience more risky behaviors while at college when granted autonomy relative to males, thus accounting for their higher psychological problems. The current study emphasizes the ongoing impact of parental influences on emerging adult outcomes and that children's preferences and perceptions influence parent-child gender dyads."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between all established DISABKIDS modules and the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF). The DISABKIDS questionnaires were developed as a tool set of both condition-generic and condition-specific modules for assessing the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents with medical conditions. Methods. All DISABKIDS modules were linked to the ICF by two trained health experts using a set of previously published linking rules. Results. We have identified 210 meaningful concepts from a total of 144 items included in all questionnaires. Concepts represented by the items in the nine different questionnaires of the DISABKIDS measurement tool set were linked to 49 different categories of the ICF: 18 categories of the component 'Body Functions', 21 categories of the component 'Activities and Participation' and 10 categories of the component 'Environmental Factors'. Conclusions. This article strongly emphasises the usefulness of the ICF as a framework and provides interesting insights into differences and similarities between the generic and the condition-specific DISABKIDS modules."
Demography	"Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data on mid-life physical health, mental health, and self-esteem, I examine inter- and intra-racial disparities in health and well-being among veteran and non-veteran men (N = 2440). After controlling for selectivity into the military via propensity weighting, I find that black veterans have higher self-esteem than white veterans and comparable black non-veterans, but white veterans have similar mid-life self-esteem as their non-veteran counterparts. I find no evidence of disparities in health for depressive symptoms and self-rated health after taking selection into military service into account. The results suggest that aspects of military service may increase blacks' self-esteem, possibly due to less discrimination and more opportunity."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This paper investigates parent perspectives on potential future applications of neuroimaging and genetic research in the OCD clinical setting. Grounded in qualitative interviews with parents whose children had participated in an OCD neuroimaging and genetic research study in the United States, we situate parent discussions of imagined futures in their projections from difficult presents and into desired pasts. Parents reported apparently high receptivity to potential future neuroimaging and genetic tests. Yet when they responded, 'yes, anything that helps', uncertainty, caution, and resistance were expressed in implicit negotiations over what it means to 'help'. We situate the discussion of future technologies in the wider context of how a biological approach figures in parents' understandings of OCD. A biological perspective was prioritised when it facilitated a journey towards understanding-as-acting; the intense gathering of knowledge judged likely to lead to better outcomes. When biological knowledge did not seem likely to lead to or itself constitute action, parents were often reluctant to even discuss it. The perspectives of those who may encounter future technologies are relevant to shaping their development, but gathering and interpreting such perspectives presents methodological, conceptual, and normative difficulties. These difficulties with time-travelling talk are discussed throughout the paper."
Education & Educational Research	"The following review examines the potential of Project Based Learning (PBL) as an instructional practice to uplift the engagement, motivation and academic achievement of low SES students in mainstream schools. To understand the impact of PBL on low SES students, the literature reflects that whilst some positives of PBL as an effective instructional practice for low SES students exist, the research into the perceived benefits is not conclusive. Conflicting findings, varied methodologies and the inconsistent employment of instruments to measure effectiveness, impact upon the ability to draw generalisable conclusions. Further research that explores the effectiveness of PBL as an instructional practice for low SES students is recommended."
"Business, Finance"	"One consequence of demographic change is substantial shifts in the age distribution of the working-age population. As the baby boom generation ages, the usual historical pattern of there being a high ratio of younger workers relative to older workers has been replaced by a pattern of there being roughly equal percentages of workers of different ages. One might expect that the increasing relative supply of older workers would lower the wage premium paid for older, more experienced workers. This paper provides strong empirical support for this hypothesis. Econometric estimates imply that the size of one's birth cohort affects wages throughout one's working life, with members of relatively large cohorts (at all stages of their careers) earning a significantly lower wage than members of smaller cohorts. Estimated elasticities of wages with respect to the relative size of one's own cohort are generally between -0.05 and -0.10, and are of similar magnitude for men and for women. Our results suggest that cohort size effects are quantitatively important and should be incorporated into public policy analyses."
Sociology	"Theoretically, the central research question of this article pertains to the way in which national institutional arrangements, namely educational systems, and related modes of labour markets and welfare provisions, affect the aggregate effectiveness of youth labour market integration in the new EU member states in comparison to the old EU countries. The study utilizes the European Union Labour Force Survey 2004. Results of the cluster analysis provide substantial support for distinct patterns of labour market entry in terms of the stratification of labour market exclusion, downgrading risk and labour market mobility of LM entrants in different CEE countries. Furthermore, the article reveals also new aspects of labour market entry in the EU-15 countries while considering not only educational signalling but also the labour market flexibility dimension."
Women'S Studies	"Sites of embodied disruption challenge academics to engage with power at its seams. In this article I consider an ethics of embodiment, situating it within questions raised by Judith Butler in her articles, Doing Justice to Someone (Butler 2001a) and Giving an Account of Oneself (Butler 2001b). In Giving an Account, Butler claims that gaps in knowledge and representation are germane to ethical practice, that brave inadequacies and creative approximations are the best we can do for others and ourselves. In Doing Justice, Butler enacts this stance, recounting the story of David Reimer, a child who in 1965 was offered up to science after his penis was severed in a botched circumcision. She seizes upon, through narrative fragments, a body whose sexual indeterminacy became the site and occasion for particularly brutal regimes of interpretation. Butler situates this patchwork narrative within the academic industry that reappropriates David's story for its own purposes. Taking Butler's ideas to heart, I carefully trace the nuances of her argument and highlight the (necessary) silences and foreclosures of her account. I propose seamfulness as a possible ethical-aesthetic strategy for embodying Butler's ethical concerns. I close by briefly introducing some implications for arts-informed representations in academic work."
Development Studies	"The paper examines the structure and performance of the textiles and clothing sectors in Zimbabwe. Based on firm level data, it examines the challenges and factors behind the resilience of the two sectors. It shows that increased flexibility, reduced capacity utilisation, modernisation of production systems and production incentives were among the most important factors exploited by firms to remain in business. It shows the main hindrance as macroeconomic instability that caused raw materials and skills shortages. It concludes that the sectors still have comparative advantage that can be exploited in a stable economy. The challenge is that the longer the current crisis goes unresolved, the more likely it is that the sectors will lose all the potential comparative advantage, implying that firms that have survived the crisis since 1997 may eventually be forced to shut down.

Rehabilitation	"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to provide knowledge about professional carers' subjective descriptions and understanding of older adults' participation in everyday life, when living in place and depending on home-based service delivery. Method. Thirty professionals from different organisational levels were selected, allowing for differences in ages, gender, length of working experience, and profession or education. Six focus group discussions were held. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. Results. The core category was identified as 'participation in one's own life'. Two categories included the care providers' descriptions and understanding of participation in the life of older adults; 'carrying out tasks in everyday-life' and 'interaction during service delivery'. Participation as carrying out tasks was related to the contexts inside and outside the house. The professional carers' understandings of older adults' participation in interaction during service delivery included three categories; 'Being included and taking part in decision-making', 'socialising during service delivery' and 'collaboration in keeping up or regaining functions'. Conclusions. To promote participation for older adults living in place and in the context of service delivery, the findings suggest that the professional carers must extend their focus on participation as socialising and its significance for older adults. At a system level there is a need to focus on how the professional role in home-based service delivery can be adjusted and developed to promote collaboration about participation in older adults."
"Education, Special"	"This study examines chronological patterns of attendance and academic performance of urban students who are identified as truants in Grade 8. A chronological review of 42 student records, from school entry through Grade 8, identified high frequencies of absenteeism and academic performance issues beginning at school entry and, in many cases, persisting throughout elementary and middle school years. Results suggest that ongoing analysis of attendance data within a school system could help to identify early patterns of absenteeism that lead to truancy in upper elementary and middle school grades. Additionally, the study indicates a need for socioemotional support, as well as early and appropriate referral and evaluation for children who are struggling in school, and it calls into question the practice of retention and social promotion as a response to absenteeism and poor school performance among elementary school children."
Development Studies	"Climate change has become a major national, regional and international problem cutting across developed and developing countries alike. Within the developing world, the effects of climate change have been devastating; this has caused enormous human suffering. The Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional economic block of 15 countries, has been badly ravaged by the vagaries of climate change. The urban areas in particular appear to have been very badly impacted as flooding, drought, pollution and deforestation have become endemic. The impacts of climate change have triggered human suffering of immense magnitude, especially in areas occupied by the marginalised. This article is based on desk research and, using qualitative analysis, examines the impact of climate change on SADC countries, considers initiatives that the regional block has in place in efforts to mitigate the human suffering experienced as a consequence of the negative impact of climate change and, finally, considers a way forward."
Public Administration	"While various descriptive and prescriptive citizen participation models suggest ways to improve citizen participation, none has been subjected to large-scale empirical tests. This article develops and tests an organizational theory model that explores the conditions under which citizen involvement as a general strategy can improve administrative decision making. The new model focuses on organizational variables that are more directly subject to managerial influence, such as political support, leadership, red tape, and hierarchical authority, as well as variables related to participant competence and representativeness. Hypotheses are tested with data collected from a national survey of local government managers. The results suggest that public management matters for citizen participation. The conclusion calls for integrating quantitative designs with normative and qualitative citizen participation research."
Business	"An increasing number of consumers rely on online reviews to make purchase decisions in today's global service industry. In this article, we investigate the impact of power on a consumer's willingness to spread word-of-mouth (WOM) by posting an online review. Drawing on self-enhancement theory, which suggests that an individual is motivated to spread WOM in order to boost his or her self-image, and the agentic versus communal theory of power, we argue that the impact of power is moderated by the valence of the customer's service experience, and its congruity with that of other forum users. Results from three studies in hotel and restaurant contexts indicate that powerless consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Conversely, powerful consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the overriding consensus is negative. Further, such results hold only for positive (vs. negative) service experiences. Managerially, our findings suggest that introducing power mechanisms such as influence rankings or helpful votes into online consumer forums may shape review posting behaviors. Service marketers and social media managers need to be aware that some customer segments are not inclined to post positive online reviews. As indicated by our findings, powerful consumers, such as those with high helpful ratings or elite reviewer status, are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is negative. Conversely, powerless consumers, such as those with low helpful ratings or junior reviewer status, might be more inclined to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Based on our findings, we also discussed the theoretical contributions, limitations, and ideas for future research."

"Business, Finance"	"Accounting is an instrument and an object in globalisation but its impact and manifestation is not uniform across Northern developed countries and Southern developing countries (DCs). This paper reviews contributions on globalisation and its influence on accounting in DCs, and identifies important research gaps. It examines the role of accounting in changing development policies, from state capitalism through neo-liberal market-based to good governance policies. It then considers specific accounting issues, namely the diffusion of International Accounting Standards (now International Financial Reporting Standards) and how they promote global neo-liberalism; the development of the accounting profession in DCs in the face of competition from Northern global accounting firms and professional associations; accounting issues in state-owned organisations, and privatised and multinational corporations; government accounting reforms and the resurrection of the state in DCs; social and environmental accounting issues; and the rise of non-governmental organisations and their accounting and accountability. The discussion and conclusions reflect on achievements to date and important areas requiring further development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Ethics	"In this essay I discuss a novel engineering ethics class that has the potential to significantly decrease the likelihood that students (and professionals) will inadvertently or unintentionally act unethically in the future. This class is different from standard engineering ethics classes in that it focuses on the issue of why people act unethically and how students (and professionals) can avoid a variety of hurdles to ethical behavior. I do not deny that it is important for students to develop cogent moral reasoning and ethical decision-making as taught in traditional college-level ethics classes, but as an educator, I aim to help students apply moral reasoning in specific, real-life situations so they are able to make ethical decisions and act ethically in their academic careers and after they graduate. Research in moral psychology provides evidence that many seemingly irrelevant situational factors affect the moral judgment of most moral agents and frequently lead agents to unintentionally or inadvertently act wrongly. I argue that, in addition to teaching college students moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, it is important to: 1. Teach students about psychological and situational factors that affect people's ethical judgments/behaviors in the sometimes stressful, emotion-laden environment of the workplace; 2. Guide students to engage in critical reflection about the sorts of situations they personally might find ethically challenging before they encounter those situations; and 3. Provide students with strategies to help them avoid future unethical behavior when they encounter these situations in school and in the workplace."
Social Issues	"Climate justice activists envision a ""postcarbon"" future that not only transforms energy infrastructures but also redresses the fossil fuel economy's long-standing racial inequalities. Yet this anti-racist rebranding of the ""zero emissions"" telos does not tend to the racial grief that's foundational to white supremacy. Accordingly, I ask: can we address racial oppression through a ""just transition"" to a ""postcarbon"" moment? In response, I connect today's postcarbon imaginary with yesterday's postcolonial imaginary. Drawing from research on US-based climate activism, I explore how the utopic rhetoric of a ""just transition"" is instantiated in practice. I argue that the racialized absences constitutive of what scholars call ""postcolonial amnesia"" are operative in the anti-racist move to a postcarbon moment. This postcarbon imaginary formulates the vulnerability of people of color to biophysical disasters as the raison d'etre for infrastructural transformation. This, I argue, has the effect of overlooking the ways in which racial grief inheres in such vulnerability and the capacity of energy infrastructures to uphold racist hierarchies. I situate this ""postcarbon amnesia"" in Anne Cheng's framework for differentiating ""grief"" from ""grievance,"" calling for renewable energy transitions that move away from enumerative grievances and toward a sobering recognition of racial grief."
"Education, Special"	"Estimates suggest that up to one quarter of people who have a severe learning disability engage in self injurious behaviour (SIB). SIB poses serious risks, both to the person's physical health and their quality of life. Behavioural approaches have made a contribution to supporting people who engage in SIB, although the last review of these approaches was completed in 2001. The current study provides an update to this review, and has considered papers published over the last 10 years. Asystematic search of peer reviewed journals and the 'grey' literature identified 34 relevant documents, the majority of which were single case studies. These papers tended to report only on changes in the frequency of SIB during the intervention; one cannot conclude, therefore, about the long term efficacy and generalisability of these approaches. Reductions in SIB were highly variable, often produced in controlled environments and with the use of aversive interventions. The current study presents implications for research and clinical practice and highlights the need for more research reporting on the effectiveness of new interventions such as positive behavioural support."
Geography	"Improved Forest Management (IFM) projects under the California cap-and-trade market allow production of new, non-traditional commodities: forest carbon offsets. Earlier analyses have considered forest offsets generated through tree planting in the Global South, as vehicles for sustainable development. However, the California IFM program is testing offset production in new geographic and forest management contexts: with offsets produced and consumed within the US on working (timber producing) forests. With data drawn from California IFM project design documents and in-depth interviews with carbon project developers, this study traces the development, sale, and maintenance of forest offsets, in order to map access to benefits along the commodity chain. Results reveal that the cost and complexity of rendering biological services 'real' for market legitimacy are reducing benefits to marginal landowners, who lack needed capital, knowledge, and technology to bring offsets to market. An important insight of this study is that the state has maintained power over program participation and offset supply through control of the forest offset methodology, creating a production process largely mediated by the state, adding risk and uncertainty to market participation. Findings provide an empirical example of neoliberal nature and offer broader lessons on governance and benefit distribution for ecosystem service commodity chains. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Ethics	"So-called activation policies aiming at bringing jobless people into work have been a central component of welfare reforms across OECD countries during the last decades. Such policies combine restrictive and enabling programs, but their characteristic feature is that enabling programs are also mandatory, and non-compliers are sanctioned. There are four main arguments that can be used to defend mandatory activation of benefit recipients. We label them efficiency, sustainability, paternalism, and justice. Each argument is analysed in turn. First we clarify which standards it invokes, thereafter we evaluate each argument according to its own standards and introduce competing normative concerns that have to be taken into account."
Education & Educational Research	"In this exploratory study, self-rated measures from two co-teachers who taught mathematics to a group of students with and without disabilities were gathered to determine perspectives about their co-teaching experiences. Students also completed three measures. Students and co-teachers agreed that the one-teach, one observe or drift co-teaching model was used most frequently. Although students noted the general educator was the instructional lead, they also believed the special educator provided a valid and valuable role in providing help to all students. All students reported high levels of school belongingness and self-efficacy. Some results matched other researchers' findings that special educators are less frequently the lead teacher, yet our results indicated students appreciated the support received from both co-teachers. Students' reports may have been influenced by their co-teachers' mastery approach to instruction, which emphasised students' individual progress versus a competitive approach. Implications for researchers and co-teachers include examining how supportive co-teaching can be transformed to maximise instructional experiences for students, and how positive co-teacher relationships translate to students' sense of belonging and increased self-efficacy."
Political Science	"We present a model of two-candidate elections in which candidates are office-motivated, campaigning is voluntary and costly, and one candidate has a valence advantage. In equilibrium, the order of campaign announcements matters: Each candidate would prefer to announce his or her position after the other candidate has announced his or hers. The fundamental predictions of the model are (1) the impact of valence and campaigning costs on candidates' equilibrium behaviors is in general ambiguous, requiring further specification of the details of the electoral situation, and (2) in general, equilibrium platform announcements are essentially independent of the location of the median voter's ideal point. In addition, the model is consistent with elections in which both, only one, or neither candidate actively campaigns, and, finally, even when one candidate has a large valence advantage, there might be no equilibrium in which he or she will win the election with certainty."
Development Studies	"This article posits that gendered militarized labour, women""s everyday entrepreneurialism and political mobilizations around subnational autonomy are intricately linked. To understand the relationship between these entities, one needs to zero in on the generational dynamics of women""s collective engagement in upholding the martial identity of Gorkhas, and the consequences of such preoccupation on the legibility of Gorkha subjects vis-a-vis the Indian state. To locate the specificity of women""s collective engagements with Gorkhaland, I propose a de-essentialized intersectional perspective in drawing up my framework of ""subnational enterprise"". I draw from Black Feminist scholarship on the nuances of mothering and community work, strains of Feminist International Relations perspectives that attend to the invisibility of gendered labour in situations of conflict, and the emerging feminist work on entrepreneurialism which emphasize its socio-psychological aspects. My framework of subnational enterprise draws on 16 years of longitudinal ethnographic work in urban and rural areas of Darjeeling, and in this piece, I draw on life history interviews as well as unstructured interviews with men and women in Darjeeling. I advocate for grounded explorations of the relationship between militarization, discourses of belonging and gender identity to explain how right and left agendas jostle within a regional autonomy movement."
Ethnic Studies	"As a symptom, the question ""who's out in hip hop"" evidences a set of logics about race, sexuality, and visibility, which this article examines in relation to a series of news reports about the ""first (mainstream) gay rapper"" in 2012. Elaborating on Richard Iton's concern over the violently public ways black life is experienced, this article attends to how certain hip hop artists-hailed as the ""first gay rapper""-navigate sexual publicity for techniques that may be instructive for temporarily remediating the endemic problem of blackness, as an always publicly experienced phenomenon."
Communication	"This introduction to the special issue describes the impetus for a review of the merger of mass and interpersonal communication processes in light of recent developments in communication technologies. It reviews historical arguments about the need for integration in theorizing about communication processes. Then, it discusses the potential for communication technologies to combine mass and interpersonal communication in ways that obviate the traditional distinction between both types, and how interactive communication technology offers unprecedented analytic approaches for research. Finally, it previews the 11 essays that follow by identifying 4 types of convergence of mass and interpersonal communication: concurrence, integration, transformation, and evolution."
Business	"This research empirically examines the effect of various Internet shopping site qualities on the utilitarian and hedonic values of Internet shopping. The influence of the perceived level of Internet shopping value on customer satisfaction and repurchase intention is also investigated. We perform structural equation analysis with a sample of 293 observations consisting of two different income groups (workforce and student). Our results show that while system and service qualities are critical factors affecting utilitarian shopping value, information and service qualities are the factors most closely associated with hedonic shopping value. These findings suggest that service quality plays a significant role in increasing both utilitarian and hedonic shopping values. Our results also show that the impact of quality factors on Internet shopping values and subsequent repurchase intention differs across the two income groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

History	"For those who by the end of the twentieth century came to be termed survivors of child sexual abuse, different genres and forms have been available to narrate and evaluate that abuse. This article explores the reception and practical results of such disclosures: the unpredictable effects of telling, and the strategies of containment, silencing, or disbelief that greeted disclosures. I make note of the ethical challenges of writing the history of child sexual abuse and conclude that twenty-first-century observers have been too ready to perceive much of the previous century as a period of profound silence in relation to child sexual abuse. At the same time, historical and sociological accounts have also been too ready to claim the final third of the twentieth century as a period of compulsive disclosure and fluency in constructing sexual selves. The history of child sexual abuse reveals significant barriers to disclosure in the 1970s and 1980s, despite new visibility of child sexual abuse in the media and through feminist sexual politics. Attention to such obstacles suggests the need to rethink narratives of permissive sexual change to acknowledge more fully the ongoing inequities and hierarchies in sexual candor and voice."
Business	"Tourism is increasingly important for wine regions and local economies. The purpose of this research is to use both symmetric (SEM) and asymmetric (fsQCA) methods to explore the role of motivation and involvement in tourists"" intention to return to a wine region. To test these relations the study uses an online survey to obtain a convenience sample of 292 responses from Rioja and Bordeaux wine tourists. The SEM model shows that participation in wine events and product involvement positively relate to the intention to return. Two sufficient configurations in the fsQCA consistently lead to the intention: high core wine and education, high product involvement, and high participation in wine events combined with escape and socialization or with the destination""s attractiveness. These results can help wine managers and operators design differentiated strategies to address the specific needs of wine tourists."
Public Administration	"IMPACT Governments in Australia have provided variable support to, and actual involvement in, successive public sector reforms over the past 40 years. The latter's success in implementation, not surprisingly, has been most evident when governments (and ministers) have contributed to ongoing development and implementation initiatives. The political environment was generally stable in much of the earlier decades and governments 'enjoyed' higher levels of public trust and confidence than they do now in a much more politically turbulent situation. A better focus on risk management in producing required outcomes would contribute significantly to better performance and to greater public support and involvement. While one would not wish to be seen as merely 'tilting at windmills', actual results achieved do more for public confidence than simply providing assurance about administrative decisions in spending public money, important as that is in the public context. In order for ministers (and even cabinets for particular programmes) to be involved in issues such as risk appetite and risk tolerance, they need to have confidence in the risk management policies and practices implemented in the agency/department and its governance framework. Sometimes the next step is easier than it might first appear. The impending report of the Independent Review of the Australian Public Service might be the catalyst necessary to take that step in the public interest and restore confidence in government. Taking a risk with public money has long been anathema to parliaments and the general public in any Westminster system of government with a particular emphasis on administrative and financial legislation involving administrative process and prohibition. The latter have been reinforced by associated rules, controls and regulations and subject to external oversight and investigation by treasury/finance and attorney general departments, policing bodies and audit offices, to name a few. In recent years, attention has been increasingly focused on programme outcomes and associated performance measures. This has raised the question of taking risks to achieve better outcomes. After all, this is what happens in the private sector. This question achieved a higher profile with the greater involvement of the private sector in the determination and delivery of public services. But does the public sector have the necessary insights and skills and experience to make the necessary judgements and achieve the required outcomes within a legislated framework of ethical conduct, values and public interest requirements? And is this really acceptable to governments, legislative bodies and the public?"
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This study addresses the impact that transferring from one plant to another has on workers in terms of their levels of commitment, involvement and satisfaction with their union. Findings indicate that race is a determinate factor. Minorities that did transfer report being less committed workers and less involved with their union than minorities already working at the plant. Also, in terms of union commitment, involvement, and satisfaction although the age of the worker is not a significant factor, females are significantly more involved with their union than males. Accordingly, rank and file workers whom are elected or appointed union officials are more satisfied and involved with their union then those workers not in official union positions. In June of 2007, the survey was developed by the authors, and endorsed and administered by a major industrial union. The total population of the plant under review is 1640 workers.

Urban Studies	"As the number of global cities grows and the extent of their city region hinterlands expands it is increasingly important to understand connectivity of cities within global city regions to the core city as well as connectivity of both the core city and the entire city region to other cities in the world city network. By investigating multi scalar network connectivity of Shanghai both to cities in its hinterland and the world city network from 2000 to 2013, this article concludes that Shanghai's status as a global city is based both on connections to cities within the region and connections of Shanghai municipality to other cities in the world city network. Based on measures of connectivity such as connectedness of advanced producer service firms, airport arrivals and departures, and container TEUs, since 2000 Shanghai has become one of the most connected cities in the world. However, Shanghai's global connectivity is not the same as its importance in the world economy. The market value of firms listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, foreign exchange turnover, and international transshipments from the Port of Shanghai are modest compared to other leading global cities. City network analysis within the Shanghai mega-city region provides a novel explanation for this apparent paradox. Shanghai's global connectivity is strongly influenced by its close connection with its hinterland, the Yangtze River Delta, and elsewhere in China. Shanghai's rapidly growing global connectivity is largely a result of the emergence of the Yangtze River Delta as a global city region. Shanghai, as the core city in the city region, is both a hub connecting flows of goods, capital, people, and information within the Yangtze River Delta region and a gateway through which other cities in the city region connect to the world city network. Scholars worldwide can apply the methods used in this article to illuminate the hybrid global city pathway."
Environmental Studies	"Coastal barrier systems around the world are experiencing higher rates of flooding and shoreline erosion. Property owners on barriers have made significant financial investments in physical protections that shield their nearby properties from these hazards, constituting a type of adaptation to shoreline change. Factors that contribute to adaptation on Plum Island, a developed beach and dune system on the North Shore of Massachusetts, are investigated here. Plum Island experiences patterns of shoreline change that may be representative of many inlet-associated beaches, encompassing an equivocal and dynamically shifting mix of erosion and accretion. In the face of episodic floods and fleeting erosive events, and driven by a combination of strong northeast storms and cycles of erosion and accretion, the value of the average Plum Island residence increases by 34% for properties on the oceanfront where protection comprises a publicly constructed soft structure. Even in the face of state policies that ostensibly discourage physical protection as a means of adaptation, coastal communities face significant political and financial pressures to maintain existing protective structures or to allow contiguous groups of property owners to build new ones through collective action. These factors mitigate against adapting to shoreline change by retreating from the coast, thereby potentially increasing the adverse effects of coastal hazards."
Women'S Studies	"The point of departure for this contribution is the observation that, in the debate about the post-growth society, the transformation of masculinity has not yet been taken into consideration. This is particularly surprising, given that the rise of growth-oriented capitalism has been associated with a subjectivity shaped by growth and its codes of masculinity. Confronting the question of the transition to a post-growth society also means facing the question of how this androcentric form of subjectivity can be overcome. The aim here is to show how the research questions addressed in Caring Masculinities, which are playing an increasingly important role in policy development and masculinities research, can be used productively in addressing issues related to the transition to a post-growth society."
Health Policy & Services	"One of the largest drivers of the current obesity epidemic is thought to be excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Some have proposed vending machine restrictions and taxing soft drinks to curb children's consumption of soft drinks; to a large extent, these policies have not been evaluated empirically. We examine these policies using two nationally representative data sets and find no evidence that, as currently practiced, either is effective at reducing children's weight. We conclude by outlining changes that may increase their effectiveness, such as implementing comprehensive restrictions on access to soft drinks in schools and imposing higher tax rates than are currently in place in many jurisdictions."
Public Administration	"Building on an initial stream of research on the relationship between strategy process and performance, this article analyzes the effect of strategic planning and logical incrementalism on the performance of 104 small and medium-size urban transit agencies in the United States. Data on strategy development were obtained through an online survey of agency managers, while objective performance data were drawn from the National Transit Database. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to test the effects of the two planning approaches and of the interaction between them in 2008, controlling for contextual and operational variables as well as performance in 2004. The results suggest that strategic planning exerts a positive influence on effectiveness and system productivity measures, but does not influence efficiency or cost-effectiveness measures. Logical incrementalism by itself appears to have a negative effect on the number of passenger trips per capita and transit system productivity measures. However, conducting strategic planning efforts within a larger framework of logical incremental decision-making, as represented by the interaction term, positively affects both the effectiveness and the system productivity measures. Taken together, these results suggest that strategic planning, whether on its own or combined with logical incrementalism, has a positive effect on some dimensions of performance, at least within the context of the public transit service industry."
"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary"	"This article contributes to the growing field of research on military LGBT policy development by exploring the case of Sweden, a non-NATO-member nation regarded as one of the most progressive in terms of the inclusion of LGBT personnel. Drawing on extensive archival work, the article shows that the story of LGBT policy development in the Swedish Armed Forces from 1944 to 2014 is one of long periods of status quo and relative silence, interrupted by leaps of rapid change, occasionally followed by the re-appearance of discriminatory policy. The analysis brings out two periods of significant change, 1971-1979 and 2000-2009, here described as turns in LGBT policy. During the first turn, the military medical regulation protocol's recommendation to exempt gay men from military service was the key issue. During these years, homosexuality was classified as mental illness, but in the military context it was largely framed in terms of security threats, both on a national level (due to the risk of blackmail) and for the individual homosexual (due to the homophobic military environment). In the second turn, the focus was increasingly shifted from the LGBT individual to the structures, targeting the military organization itself. Furthermore, the analysis shows that there was no ban against LGBT people serving in the Swedish Armed Forces, but that ways of understanding and regulating sexual orientation and gender identity have nonetheless shaped the military organization in fundamental ways, and continue to do so."
"Education, Special"	"Group work for people who experience voice hearing in the mainstream population has been shown to have various benefits; however, there is little research describing hearing voices groups for people with learning disabilities. This study describes perceptions of a new hearing voices group for people with mild learning disabilities. Semi-structured interviews with twelve participants were conducted. This included three clients who attended the hearing voices group, three of their family members/carers and one professional. In addition, of those who were referred to the group but chose not to attend, one client, two family members/carers and two professionals were interviewed. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was used to identify three overarching themes; the first benefits of our hearing voices group' described participants' evaluations and perceptions of the hearing voices group. The second making the decision to attend' covers factors that influence clients when deciding whether or not to attend a hearing voices group. In the final theme positive and negative contributors to the voice-hearing experience', participants reflected on factors that affect the voice-hearing experience. The hearing voices group was valued by participants; however, services should consider the barriers to attendance faced by some clients. Strategies for addressing these are discussed."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and older that is working or actively looking for work. It is an important labor market measure because it represents the relative amount of labor resources available for the production of goods and services. After rising for more than three decades, the overall labor force participation rate peaked in early 2000 and subsequently trended down. In recent years, the movement of the baby-boom population into age groups that generally exhibit low labor force participation has contributed to the decline in the overall participation rate. From 2000 to 2015, most of the major demographic groups saw a decrease in labor force participation. Teenagers experienced the largest drop in participation, which coincided with a rise in their school enrollment rate. Young adults 20 to 24 years also showed a decline in labor force participation, but the decrease was not as steep as that for teenagers. The labor force participation rate of women 25 to 54 years also fell, with the decrease more pronounced for women who did not attend college. The labor force participation rate of men 25 to 54 years continued its long-term decline. As in the past, the decrease in participation among men with less education was greater than that of men with more education. However, labor force participation rates of men and women 55 years and older rose from 2000 to 2009 and subsequently leveled off."
Family Studies	"Using data from the TYP (Taiwan Youth Project) panel survey, we examine factors associated with early marriages in Taiwan and the subsequent risks for negative outcomes in family life and career trajectories. About 7% of Taiwanese people marry early, that is, before the age of 28 years. Among those who marry early, more than 60% report the birth of a child within the first 8 months of marriage (i.e., they form postconception ""shotgun"" marriages). Compared with the never married respondents, individuals in both preconception and postconception early marriages are likely to come from families of low socioeconomic status. Nonworking young adults and those experiencing parental divorce or parental death during adolescence are at higher risk of entering postconception marriages than those remaining single. Particularly for nonemployed young people and those from lower socioeconomic status background, early marriage means taking on adult responsibilities in a disadvantaged state."
Criminology & Penology	"Although economic abuse is one of the major tactics of intimate partner violence, there has been a lack of empirical evidence on the factors associated with economic abuse and its mental well-being outcomes in Chinese population. This study aimed to identify risk factors for and mental well-being of economic abuse in Chinese population. This was a cross-sectional household survey with 504 Chinese adults in Hong Kong. It was found that unmarried individuals and individuals with tertiary education or above were at risk of economic abuse. Moreover, there were significant association between economic abuse experience and anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms. Resilience was the protective factor against anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms. The findings were discussed alongside with Chinese culture."
"Education, Special"	"This audit investigated residential staff beliefs around pain thresholds and strategies they adopt to recognise and manage pain in people with learning disabilities across Surrey. A structured interview was constructed to elicit information. Results demonstrated that pain is not being effectively recognised or managed by residential staff in Surrey. It highlighted the need for training for staff in how to recognise and manage pain, as well as the need for appropriate pain recognition tools and communication aids to be utilised to support people with learning disabilities to be able to communicate their pain to others. It also indicated the need for better communication between staff and other services that the person with learning disabilities accesses."
Cultural Studies	"Despite their stigma, conspiracy theories are hugely popular today and have pervaded mainstream culture. Increasingly, such theories expanded into large master schemes of deceit where ""everything is connected"". Moving beyond discussions of their truthfulness, we study in this article how such ""super conspiracy theories"" are made plausible. We strategically selected the case study of David Icke - a true celebrity in conspiracy circles and main proponent of such all-encompassing narratives - to analyze his discursive strategies of legitimation: How does he support and validate his extraordinary claims? It is our argument that Icke succeeds by exploiting multiple sources of epistemic authority; he draws eclectically on ""experience"", ""tradition"", ""futuristic imageries"", ""science"" and ""social theory"" to convince his audience. In a Western culture without any full monopoly on truth, and for a people wary of mainstream authorities, it proves opportune to draw on a wide variety of epistemic sources when claiming knowledge."
Environmental Studies	"This essay makes a case for centering the questions of ecological knowledge in order to understand how environmental governance and resource access are being remade in the frontier ecologies of Asia. These frontiers, consisting of the so-called uplands and coastal zones, are increasingly subject to new waves of extractive and conservation activities, prompted in part by rising values attached to these ecologies by new actors and actor coalitions. Drawing on recent writings in science and technology studies, we examine the coproduction (Jasanoff 2004) of ecological knowledge and governance at this conjuncture of neoliberal interventions, land grabs, and climate change. We outline the complex ways through which the involvement of new actors, new technologies, and practices of boundary work, territorialisation, scale-making, and expertise transform the dynamics of the coproduction of knowledge and governance. Drawing on long term field research in Asia, the articles in this special section show that resident peoples are often marginalised from the production and circulation of ecological knowledge, and thus from environmental governance. While attentive to the entry of new actors and to the shifts in relations of authority, control, and decision-making, the papers also present examples of how this marginalisation can be challenged, by highlighting the limits of boundary-work and expertise in such frontier ecologies."
Social Issues	"A comprehensive analysis of the strategies pursued by nonprofit agencies must take into account not only the conventional market forces but also the social expectations and constraints that the agencies regularly confront. This study reports on a theoretically guided, qualitative analysis of the strategies that develop in the context of such factors. Data stem from interviews with officials from 12 agencies, the agencies' prime funding agency, and interest groups. The results suggest that sampled agencies occasionally use conventionally described strategies as well as the social and political strategies covered in several previous studies, but that they most frequently rely on rarely considered ""relationship"" strategies by which they seek to establish and preserve an image or status. The results are argued to inform strategic decision making and to suggest ways in which agency officials may take into account two sources of social expectations and constraints: institutional arrangements and organizational identities."
Business	"Drawing on Kilbourne's expanded macromarketing model, this research tests the effects of neoliberalism and trade liberalization on a set of environmental outcomes, shedding light on the relationships between importing and exporting, national, non-national, and foreign investment, and environmental stringency on major polluting accidents, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and wind energy deployment in China. The results from a moderated, fixed-effects regression model of longitudinal province-level data indicate that neoliberal policies impact environmental performance, while being region specific, sensitive to ownership type, and bidirectional. Additionally, non-national investment and innovation level were positively related with a reduction in major polluting accidents, whereas national investment were positively associated with reducing SO2 emissions and increasing wind energy deployment. China's environmental policies, however, were found to catalyze pollution production in the landlocked central and underdeveloped western provinces. As such, policymakers and practitioners should adopt a stakeholder orientation, institute strict environmental regulations, and place community welfare and environmental stewardship above profits when encouraging economic growth."
Education & Educational Research	"A large number of studies in CMC have assessed how social interaction, processes and learning outcomes are intertwined. The present research explores how the degree of self-determination of learners, that is the motivational orientation of a learner, influences the communication and interaction patterns in an online Problem Based Learning environment. Given the complexity of CMC, we expected that autonomous learners would be more willing to contribute to cognitive discourse. In time, we expected that control-oriented learners would develop a preferential attachment to contribute to discourse from autonomous learners. Data were gathered from 37 autonomous and 39 control-oriented learners who posted 1669 messages. Using a dynamic multi-method approach of content analysis of cognitive and social discourse, social network analysis, and measures of academic motivation, we find some preliminary evidence that motivational orientation influences communication and social interaction patterns amongst learners. From the beginning, most control-oriented learners develop a preference to connect to and communicate with autonomous learners, although a separate team-analysis indicates that group dynamics also influence how learners develop connections with other learners in time. Our findings further the understanding of differences found in distance learning courses about participation and drop-out."
Rehabilitation	"Purpose: In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a 12-weekly anxiety treatment programme adapted for individuals with moderate-severe TBI, based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI). The current study explored the variables associated with treatment response and group differences in change expectancy and working alliance. Methods: Twenty-seven participants recruited from a brain injury rehabilitation hospital were randomly assigned to MI + CBT, non-directive counselling (NDC) + CBT and treatment-as-usual and assessors were blinded to treatment conditions. Correlation and multiple regression were used to examine the association between reduction in anxiety ratings and a number of clinical, injury and cognitive variables. Random effects regression was used to examine group difference in changes in working alliance and expectancy. Results: There was a trend suggesting that greater injury severity may be predictive of poorer response to CBT and injury severity was significantly related to memory functioning. Participants receiving MI pre-treatment showed a greater increase in change expectancy at the end of CBT and at follow-up, but not at the end of MI. Conclusions: There is a need to further investigate the effectiveness of treatment for individuals with different injury severity and to explore the relationship between change expectancy and treatment outcome."
Education & Educational Research	"Many school-improvement efforts include time for teacher collaboration, with the assumption that teachers"" collective work supports instructional improvement. However, not all collaboration equally supports learning that would support improvement. As a part of a 5-year study in two urban school districts, we collected video records of more than 100 mathematics teacher workgroup meetings in 16 different middle schools, selected as best cases of teacher collaboration. Building off of earlier discursive analyses of teachers"" collegial learning, we developed a taxonomy to describe how conversational processes differentially support teachers"" professional learning. We used the taxonomy to code our corpus, with each category signaling different learning opportunities. In this article, we present the taxonomy, illustrate the categories, and report the overall dearth of meetings with rich learning opportunities, even in this purposively sampled data set. This taxonomy provides a coding scheme for other researchers, as well as a map for workgroup facilitators aiming to deepen collaborative conversations."
Cultural Studies	"This study examines Viacom's MTV localisation strategy in East Asia - specifically South Korea, China and Japan, which should be interpreted not in the context of globalisation but of glocalisation, because the strategy for entry into foreign markets means that localised programming and business modes are more successful than other strategies (e. g. standardisation or unification). The results of this study show that Viacom's MTV used joint ventures as its primary localised business mode in East Asia. This particular mode is more efficient and beneficial to an international company like Viacom in countries that are not only distant, but also culturally, politically, financially and economically challenging to them. In terms of localised programming, MTV Korea, MTV China and MTV Japan all used local staff and local languages, and all three channels showed different trends in the types of programmes they broadcast: MTV Korea aired more local programmes, MTV Japan aired more Western music and MTV China depended more on programming from neighbouring nations."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"Data from the Employment Cost Index show that health insurance costs relative to payroll increased 34 percent between 1996 and 2005 and that the increase was largest for businesses paying low wages; simultaneously, data from the Employee Benefits Survey show that benefit packages became less generous, yet cost growth was not paralleled by a commensurate decrease in employer offers"
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"We outline the framework of the new project of Critical Neuroscience: a reflexive scientific practice that responds to the social, cultural and political challenges posed by the advances in the behavioural and brain sciences. Indeed, the new advances in neuroscience have given rise to growing projects of the sociology of neuroscience as well as neuroethics. In parallel, however, there is also a growing gulf between social studies of neuroscience and empirical neuroscience itself. This is where Critical Neuroscience finds its place. Here, we begin with a sketch of several forms of critique that can contribute to developing a model of critical scientific practice. We then describe a set of core activities that jointly make up the practice of Critical Neuroscience as it can be applied and practised both within and outside of neuroscience. We go on to propose three possible areas of application: (1) the problems related to new possibilities of neuropharmacological interventions; (2) the importance of culture, and the problems of reductionism, in psychiatry; (3) the use of imaging data from neuroscience in the law as alleged evidence about 'human nature'."
Cultural Studies	"This article reads the notion of mediatization through a current example of architectural practice: the Axel Springer Campus in Berlin. Based on current theories of mediatization, it shows how this architectural project for a media firm finds new ways for architecture itself to function as a medium. It argues that architect Rem Koolhaas developed an architectural design that has the capacity to mediate images and interpretations of the productivity of media practitioners, of the relationship between media firm and urban environment, as well as of more general transformations of media work in the digital age."
"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"	"Background: Millions of people worldwide are drinking water with elevated arsenic concentrations. Epidemiologic studies, mainly cross-sectional in design, have suggested that arsenic in drinking water may affect pregnancy outcome and infant health. We assessed the association of arsenic exposure with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality in a prospective cohort study of pregnant women. Methods: A population-based, prospective cohort study of 2924 pregnant women was carried out during 2002-2004 in Matlab, Bangladesh. Spontaneous abortion was evaluated in relation to urinary arsenic concentrations at gestational week 8. Stillbirth and infant mortality were evaluated in relation to the average of urinary arsenic concentrations measured at gestational weeks 8 and 30. Results: The odds ratio of spontaneous abortion was 1.4 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96-2.2) among women with urine arsenic concentrations in the fifth quintile ""(249-1253 mu g/L; median = 382 mu g/L), compared with women in the first quintile ""(<33 mu g/L). There was no clear evidence of increased rates of stillbirth. The rate of infant mortality increased with increasing arsenic exposure: the hazard ratio was 5.0 (95% CI = 1.4-18) in the fifth quintile of maternal urinary arsenic concentrations (268-2019 mu g/L; median = 390 mu g/L), compared with the first quintile ""(<38 mu g/L). Conclusions: We found evidence of increased risk of infant mortality with increasing arsenic exposure during pregnancy, with less evidence of associations with spontaneous abortion or stillbirth risk."
Public Administration	"Background: Citizen satisfaction surveys are used in many jurisdictions to measure attitudes towards public services and inform service delivery improvement strategies. Canada is regarded as a world leader in the field due to its internationally influential Citizens First surveys. Aim: This study aims to determine the soundness of the design, execution and reporting of Canada's Citizens First surveys. Method: It presents a critical methodological review drawing on several social scientific paradigms including survey research, interpretivism and post-structuralism. Results: The Citizens First surveys contain significant problems in terms of sample representativeness, validity of causal claims and treatment of subjective opinions. These surveys can also be criticized for the influence they have had on the direction of public service reforms. Survey findings have been invoked to support the shift to private sector models of delivery and encourage a narrow and passive view of the role of the citizen in official decision-making. These developments conflict with other realities and values in contemporary administration and governance. Conclusion: Canada's citizen satisfaction surveys contain important methodological weaknesses which must be acknowledged and rectified if reformers wish to extend the scope and effectiveness of current service delivery innovations."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	". We analyse response patterns to an important survey of schoolchildren, exploiting rich auxiliary information on respondents and non-respondents cognitive ability that is correlated both with response and the learning achievement that the survey aims to measure. The survey is the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which sets response thresholds in an attempt to control the quality of data. We analyse the case of England for 2000, when response rates were deemed sufficiently high by the organizers of the survey to publish the results, and 2003, when response rates were a little lower and deemed of sufficient concern for the results not to be published. We construct weights that account for the pattern of non-response by using two methods: propensity scores and the generalized regression estimator. There is clear evidence of biases, but there is no indication that the slightly higher response rates in 2000 were associated with higher quality data. This underlines the danger of using response rate thresholds as a guide to quality of data."
Social Issues	"Within the United States, a growing debate about special tax treatment and community benefits provided by not-for-profits (NFPs) has been occurring. While the nondistribution constraint of NFPs is often thought to incentivize higher quality and more charitable care, NFPs may also be used by contractors for personal gain. This study explores whether the use of external contractors by NFP health care providers alter behavior. Using a sample of patients receiving rehabilitative care for hip fractures in skilled nursing facilities, and exploiting variation in ownership and contracting status, this study finds contracting in NFPs results in increased prevalence of profit-maximizing behaviors more commonly associated with FPs. Furthermore, contracting results in more revenue focused care delivery patterns."
Rehabilitation	"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded eligibility for subsidized health insurance, and this has the potential to substantially increase health insurance coverage among persons with disabilities. The increase will depend, at least in part, on the complexity of the application process. To facilitate access, the ACA streamlined the application process for subsidized coverage; however, this did not include disability-based coverage. This article analyzes and describes the application process, identifies complexities, and defines steps to reduce complexities. The following application complexities were identified: (a) the need for applicants to apply separately for cash assistance and subsidized coverage, (b) the need for applicants to determine whether to pursue a disability-based Medicaid determination, and (c) the absence of a way for persons to self-identify their disability on the streamlined paper application form. The analysis indicates that the application process for subsidized coverage is complex and may hinder access among persons with disabilities. We identified operational steps that states and the federal government can take to reduce the complexities and improve access."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"We analyze the statistical and economic efficiency of different designs of cluster surveys collected in two consecutive time periods, or waves. In an independent design, two cluster samples in two waves are taken independently from one another. In a cluster-panel design, the same clusters are used in both waves, but samples within clusters are taken independently in two time periods. In an observation-panel design, both clusters and observations are retained from one wave of data collection to another. By assuming a simple population structure, we derive design variances and costs of the surveys conducted according to these designs. We first consider a situation in which the interest lies in estimation of the change in the population mean between two time periods, and derive the optimal sample allocations for the three designs of interest. We then propose the utility maximization framework borrowed from microeconomics to illustrate a possible approach to the choice of the design that strives to optimize several variances simultaneously. Incorporating the contemporaneous means and their variances tends to shift the preferences from observation-panel towards simpler panel-cluster and independent designs if the panel mode of data collection is too expensive. We present numeric illustrations demonstrating how a survey designer may want to choose the efficient design given the population parameters and data collection cost."
Linguistics	"This article introduces the Verbal Irony Procedure (VIP), a first systematic method for identifying irony in natural discourse. The first section discusses previous operationalizations of irony and demonstrates that these are not explicit about which criteria were used to separate irony from non-irony. The second section argues why irony can be defined as an ""utterance with a literal evaluation that is implicitly contrary to its intended evaluation."" This section also explains why ironic utterances can be placed on an evaluation scale. In the third section, clauses are proposed as a good unit of analysis when looking at irony in natural discourse. The different steps of the VIP are then introduced in the fourth section and subsequently applied in a sample analysis of a natural text in the fifth section. The sixth section discusses a reliability analysis of the VIP protocol. The article ends with an outlook on how future research on verbal irony might benefit from applying the VIP."
Sociology	"This study examines how religion's impact on Americans' attitudes toward same-sex practices varies by the type of practice being considered. We theorize that same-sex romantic and family practices such as sexual relations, marriage, and adoption represent distinct practice types, differing in degrees of legality, cultural legitimacy, and in their internal power dynamics. Consequently, we expect that Americans view each practice type somewhat differently and their opinions on each may be influenced by religion in distinctive ways. Drawing upon national-level data, we estimate and compare the relative net effects of a comprehensive battery of religious measures on support for gay sex, marriage, and adoption, both for the full sample and across religious traditions. Analyses demonstrate that public opinion toward gay sexual relations is more strongly related to religious practice and theological conservatism compared to attitudes regarding same-sex marriage or adoption. Moreover, frequent religious practice and conservative theological beliefs about the Bible tend to be more strongly associated with attitudes toward same-sex relationships for evangelicals, compared to mainline Protestants and, to a lesser extent, Catholics. Findings ultimately affirm that the type of same-sex practice being considered (sex, marriage, or adoption) serves to moderate religions' impact on Americans' support for such practices."
Environmental Studies	"Along with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization in China since the late 1990s, a large amount of farmland has been expropriated for non-agricultural use, which has caused the emergence of many land-lost farmers. This article compares the change in employment status of land-lost farmers before and after land expropriation using the survey data of Nanjing city and analyzes the employment shock caused by land expropriation and consequent employment differentiation. The main conclusions are as follows: approximately 54% of farmers changed their original employment status after land expropriation, and the majority of them were engaged in agriculture before the expropriation; furthermore, the elderly and the farmers with lower human capital have more probability of suffering from the employment shock. In addition, there is an obvious differentiation of employment among the farmers who suffered the employment shock: the two most prominent patterns are migrant labor and unemployment, with few land-lost farmers continuing to engage in agriculture. Further econometric tests show that the improvement of human capital can significantly assist farmers in transferring to various non-agricultural occupations, but the older land-lost farmers are more likely to be unemployed, and the males are more willing to be migrant workers. In addition, there are also relationships between employment differentiation of farmers with the land compensation, land use, and living subsidy. The policy implications of this study are mainly embodied in providing vocational training to land-lost farmers and improving the targeting accuracy of employment assistance."
Education & Educational Research	"The paper explores children and youths' perceptions of the reasons for bullying in multicultural schools. How do their different backgrounds explain the variations in those perceptions? The questions will be answered based on data gathered from 9 to 10, 12 to 13 and 15 to 16-year-old students (N = 2781) in Estonia, Finland and Sweden. A survey and in-depth interviews were used in the study. About half of the students have been frequently or occasionally bullied. According to the data, the reasons for bullying were frequently attributed to visible external features, such as physical appearance or clothing, but also to the bullied students' choice of friends and language use. The most vulnerable students are those with a migration background, those who speak a different language at home that is not the language of the national majority, or who have been raised in more religiously observant families."
"Education, Special"	"A qualitative interview study was undertaken to determine the information and support needs of carers of adults who have Down's syndrome and dementia. The data were analysed thematically. Carers' information and support needs were seen to change at pre-diagnosis, diagnosis and post-diagnosis. Helping carers to manage the changing nature of the adult with dementia is seen to be an essential part of the health professional's role."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"This article draws on concepts of morality and demoralisation to understand the problematic nature of relationships between staff and patients in public health services. The article uses data from a case study of a UK hospital Emergency Department to show how staff are tasked with the responsibility of treating and caring for patients, while at the same time their actions are shaped by the institutional concerns of accountability and resource management. The data extracts illustrate how such competing agendas create a tension for staff to manage and suggests that, as a consequence of this tension, staff participate in processes of 'effacement' that limit the presence of patients and families as a moral demand. The analysis from the Emergency Department case study suggests that demoralisation is an increasingly important lens through which to understand health-care institutions, where contemporary organisational cultures challenge the ethical quality of human interaction."
Criminology & Penology	"Despite numerous public awareness campaigns child sexual abuse (CSA) remains a significant global issue affecting millions of children. This suggests that such campaigns have had minimal impact, and the paucity of good quality empirical evaluation makes it difficult to establish what has worked and what has not. This article considers how different and evolving approaches to public awareness campaigning on CSA since the 1990s have influenced (or not) attitudinal and behavioural change. The article reviews a number of key initiatives from around the world and identifies common themes that can inform campaigning and prevention efforts. Recommendations for further research efforts, social problem framing, and targeting are offered. The article concludes by arguing that more recent multi-faceted campaigns which combine a range of messaging methods are more likely to turn public awareness campaigning into public action campaigning."
"Social Sciences, Biomedical"	"Social capital is believed to improve the capacity of communities to work together for solving collective health problems. The present study was conducted in a community in northern Sweden where citizens through collective actions managed to build an association-driven health center. The aims were to describe the community's existing social capital in order to explore how Putnam's theories could contribute to an understanding of the observed high civic engagement and to discuss how other theoretical perspectives might add to an understanding of the role of social capital for health promotion. A qualitative case study was performed and the analysis followed a grounded theory approach. In accordance with Putnam, inherited social capital and high participation in existing associations were found to be important for uniting people. Beyond these, other aspects such as effective information channels, strong leaders and high social control were also significant and better understood by adding Coleman's and Bourdieu's views of social capital. If social capital is to be used for the purposes of health promotion the risk of increased social inequality as an unintended consequence needs to be considered. An awareness of how specific contextual conditions affect the building and mobilizing of social capital is also crucial. Social Theory & Health (2009) 7, 318-338. doi: 10.1057/sth.2009.6"
Demography	"The Cuban immigrant community is based on the fact that they are one of the oldest emigrant groups in Spain, for reasons of historical relationship and the political situation of recent years. In the past, Cuba was one of the main destinations for the emigration of Spaniards. The last migratory stage, which begins in 1959, reverses the meaning, Cuba-Spain. The main objective of this article is to analyze the fundamental features of the Cuban migratory phenomenon in Spain. For them we rely on a quantitative research that reviews dissimilar statistical sources."
Geography	"We examine here the discourses surrounding the lunchbox taken to school by children: aspects both of the contents and of how children consume and understand these. 1 Examples within and beyond the UK suggest that the lunchbox is a container for various aspects of the private and public. What traces can be found inside of wider social relations, including processes of care and surveillance? We argue that the lunchbox consists of intersecting spatialities, within which children constitute a public face, and create identities, relationships and subjectivities; this perspective frames opportunities for priorities in future empirical research with children."
History & Philosophy Of Science	"What are cells? How are they related to each other and to the organism as a whole? These questions have exercised biology since Schleiden and Schwann (1838-1839) first proposed cells as the key units of structure and function of all living things. But how do we try to understand them? Through new technologies like the achromatic microscope and the electron microscope. But just as importantly, through the metaphors our culture has made available to biologists in different periods and places. These two new volumes provide interesting history and philosophy of the development of cell biology. Reynolds surveys the field's changing conceptual structure by examining the varied panoply of changing metaphors used to conceptualize and explain cells - from cells as empty boxes, as building blocks, to individual organisms, to chemical factories, and through many succeeding metaphors up to one with great currency today: cells as social creatures in communication with others in their community. There is some of this approach in the Visions edited collection as well. But this collection also includes rich material on the technologies used to visualize cells and their dialectical relationship with the epistemology of the emerging distinct discipline of cell biology. This volume centres on, but is not limited to, 'reflections inspired by [E.V.] Cowdry's [1924 volume] General Cytology'; it benefits from a conference on the Cowdry volume as well as a 2011 Marine Biological Lab/Arizona State University workshop on the history of cell biology."
Environmental Studies	"The paper presents application of various Bayesian model combination schemes to metals spot prices forecasting. The considered schemes arise from recently gaining attention Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA). Lead, nickel and zinc spot prices are analyzed. Monthly data from 1996 to 2017 are used. The considered schemes seem to be an interesting alternative to some benchmark models. Interestingly, model selection is found more beneficial to tightening forecast accuracy than model averaging."
Sociology	"The text describes how the public task of the social sciences could be linked with the practice of critical sociology. Recently, interesting changes have occurred which extend this prospect. In the last years, aside from critical analyses of changing social conditions, there have also been auto-reflections on the social entanglement of knowledge about the transformation. Critical analysis of the public function of scientific diagnoses and the engagement of sociologists is the result of earlier thinking about the model of imitative modernization. The source of the latter's domination can be sought in the social characteristics of Eastern Europe; the basis is recognition of the area's historical peripheralness and long-lasting economic backwardness. The growing interest in critical sociology in Poland not only broadens the interpretative palette, but above all raises questions about the originality of interpretations: that is, it addresses the mechanism of import or local creation in the interpretation of social phenomena in the post-communist sphere."
Communication	"The empirical material of this article consists of interviews with politicians in Vasterbotten, an area in the north of Sweden. The aim of the article is to identify and analyse how these politicians relate to digital information technology and new media. What democratic opportunities and risks of information technology and new media are reflected in interviews with the politicians? What does this technology and these media mean for politicians' political strategies and for their identity production as professional politicians? We argue that the interview data reflect two partly contradictory political identities: on the one side a progressive and modern political identity, and on the other a real' and authentic' political identity. However, both identities are consistent with a digital discourse and are populist due to their pro-technological character."
Social Work	"This article uses the history of debates over the US Head Start programme (1965), Early Head Start (1994) and the UK Sure Start initiative (1998), as a window on to policy transfer. In all the three, the aim was that early intervention could offer a means of boosting children's educational attainment and of countering the wider effects of poverty on development. Nevertheless, there were also important differences between them. The first part of the article looks at UK responses to Head Start, the second at Early Head Start and the creation and subsequent direction taken by Sure Start. In the Conclusion, we sum up the arguments relating to Head Start and Sure Start and offer some broader reflections on policy transfer."
Development Studies	"This paper explores the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) into FDI least recipient regions. Panel data for 20 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and 11 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries are used for the period 2000-12. Findings of the fixed effects estimations suggest that FDI inflows into these regions are influenced by GDP per capita, infrastructure development, trade openness, and control of corruption. Conversely, inflation negatively affects FDI inflows, and rents from natural resources do not significantly influence FDI. Furthermore, the findings show that marginal benefits from any increase in the quantity of FDI determinants (with the exception of control of corruption) will be less for SSA countries. The paper concludes with important policy implications deduced from the findings."
Transportation	"Although in the great majority of States, the inspection and certification of vessels are provided as public services, the Classification Societies continue being an essential element in maritime traffic, since the official inspections and certifications generally do not take into consideration certain structural aspects or details of vessels. The starting point is an analysis of the role of the Classification Societies on the global and local scale; a case study in a medium-size port of the European Union, the Port of the Bay of Cadiz, is presented. For the case study, an analysis has been made of 507 vessels between the years 2002 and 2008. From the statistical results, it is concluded that there tends to be a direct relationship between the age of the vessel and its classification by a particular type of Society, both with respect to the profiles of risk and to whether the society is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. The same occurs with respect to the number of days a vessel is detained as a consequence of the Port State Control (PSC) inspections. Similar relationships between Classification Societies and vessels are observed with respect to the flags States, based on featuring in the Black List of the MoU, and with the subclassification of risks."
Industrial Relations & Labor	"To help mark the Monthly Labor Review's 100th year, the editors invited several producers and users of BLS data to take a look back at the last 100 years. This article looks at two published but often neglected wartime consumer expenditure surveys-one that covered expenditures in 1941 and the first 3 months of 1942 and another that covered expenditures only of urban households in 1944-to place them into the historical context of changes in consumer spending patterns from the 1930s through 2013."
Development Studies	"China, once a major recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI), has recently become one of the main 'emerging' investors, especially in developing countries. Chinese Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) plays a very prominent role in economic interaction with many African countries. This paper empirically investigates the determinants of Chinese OFDI versus 41 African countries over the period 1998-2007. The analysis is novel because it provides empirical support to the existing, so far purely anecdotic, evidence describing Chinese FDI to Africa as driven by natural resources endowments and market potential. The econometric analysis highlights strong interrelationships between Chinese FDI and economic cooperation, which make standard models of investments unfit when assessing the role of China in Africa. It also suggests some new lines of research, exploiting the strong links between these different sources of financing."
History	"This article studies the history of a single word and its movement from pre-Islamic Arabia to the languages of modern Europe. It focuses on the key moment of the early nineteenth century when the Arabic ghazw' served as the root and model of the French razzia' in the early Algerian colony. Tracing the history of the ghazw through Islamic history and its subsequent emergence in Romance forms, the essay is comparative in the sense that it asks what happens in the movement of ideas and practices through loanwords. It suggests that the violence of modern empire was linguistic in a sense which encompasses the connections between thoughts, words and deeds, whilst critiquing literatures on lexical borrowing which tend to assume the innocence of linguistic exchange. A broader conclusion on transnational history is essayed through a consideration of the razzia in the context of the so-called langue franque': that metissage of Romance languages and Arabic which prevailed amongst traders across the Mediterranean in the early modern period, and which disappeared in the imperial Mediterranean of the nineteenth century."
Anthropology	"Cities generate challenges as well as confer advantages on their inhabitants. Recent excavations and surveys in northern Mesopotamia have revealed extensive settlements with diverse populations, institutions, extended hinterlands, and mass production by the early fourth millennium BC, comparable to well-known evidence for cities in their traditional homeland of southern Iraq. However, early northern Mesopotamian cities incorporated low-density zones and flexible uses of space not yet identified in southern Mesopotamia. Evidence for violent conflict in northern Mesopotamian cities also raises questions about urban sustainability; cities succeeded despite new sources of social stress."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	"We explore the determinants of debt, financial assets and net worth at the household level by using survey data for Germany, Great Britain and the USA. To identify which households are potentially vulnerable to adverse changes in the economic environment, we also explore the determinants of a range of measures of financial pressure: the probability that a household has negative net worth; the debt-to-income ratio; mortgage income gearing; the saving-to-income ratio. Our empirical findings suggest that the poorest and the youngest households are the most vulnerable to adverse changes in their financial circumstances."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Studies have shown that companies conduct compensation strategies in times of service failure to enhance recovery satisfaction and purchase intention. The role of compensation strategy in individuals' propensity to leave fake negative reviews, however, has not been well studied. Accordingly, the present conceptual study addresses this gap. First, we present how customers' deviant behavior is the result of companies' service recovery strategies (i.e., compensation strategy) themselves. Next, we present how deviant behavior spreads out in a network and then comes to a halt. The paper concludes with a presentation of the conceptual model of the manifestation of individuals' online deviant behavior. The research is important from both theoretical and managerial perspectives. From a theoretical outlook, this study adds to the literature on the dark side of guest services by investigating deviant behavior of customers and their strong ties. The research provides practitioners with a new perspective on how their service recovery strategy of compensation can lead to individuals displaying online deviant behavior and how they should address the issue."
"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism"	"Many research evidence shows that the pollutants, especially the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), related to cigarette smoking, are harmful to the human body. Given that a hotel room is an almost air-tight setting and not very spacious, knowledge about the concentrations of PM2.5 created by cigarette smoking and the subsequent mitigation measures taken appears to be important in hotel management practice. Thus, field measurements were undertaken in a hotel room to ascertain the cigarette burning and smoking induced pollutant concentrations during the following ON and OFF conditions: with ventilation, with a window open, and using a specific air purifier designed to mitigate the effects of cigarette smoking. The investigation found that cigarette burning and smoking induced PM2.5 concentrations may reach 586 mu g/m(3) and 1368 mu g/m(3) on average when ventilation is OFF, respectively. The operation of ventilation may reduce the concentration to about 100 mu g/m(3). The effectiveness of opening a window as an alleviating measure greatly depends on outdoor PM2.5 concentrations; the observed threshold reference is 100 mu g/m(3). The tested air purifier works well for cigarette smoking, but not for cigarette burning. Implications of these results on management's mitigation measures are further discussed in this paper.

Transportation	"Given a list of flights to be operated, the tail assignment problem aims at assigning each flight to a single airplane. When dealing with tail assignment problems, airline companies are willing to define assignments which minimize not only operation costs, but also robust solutions which are able to ""resist"" perturbations. Even with robust solutions, unexpected events can occur requiring to reconsider the plan under execution. This paper presents a general methodology for repair/recovery in tail assignment problems. When considering repair/recovery solutions for the initial plan under implementation, the decision maker may want to minimize operating costs, but also limit the changes with respect to the initial plan, minimize flights cancellations etc. Hence, we formulate the repair/recovery problem as a multiobjective integer linear programming problem minimizing specified functions for various repair criteria. The choice among the efficient solutions of this multiobjective program is supported by a multi-criteria model based on an additive value function elicited indirectly from past repair/recovery instances. The proposed repair framework applies to tail assignment, and is sufficiently generic to apply to any operations management problem formulated as a compact integer linear program."
Social Work	"A survey was administered to 219 Chinese immigrant women receiving prenatal and postnatal care in a community health center in New York City to examine the practice of and factors associated with reverse-migrationsending American-born children to China to be raised by extended family members, and bringing them back upon reaching school age. Results suggest that this practice was common (57%), and was significantly associated with certain maternal and family sociodemographic characteristics. Reasons leading to and perceived impact of reverse-migration separation were also explored. The long-term consequences of reverse-migration separation on child development or family dynamics are unknown. Further research is indicated on larger samples of low-income Chinese immigrant families to explore the prevalence and consequences of this practice."
Sociology	"The author discusses three interrelated rounds of ideas. First round - origins of Russia as society, state, civilization; endogenous and exogenous vectors of society and civilization formation. The second circle - humanist choice by Russia population, concept of real humanism, humanistic turn-point in the social sciences, critical humanism as methodology to understand real evolution. Third round - the stages of humanistic modernization preparation and the focuses of Russian sociology. Many issues raised require further research."
Gerontology	"Milwaukee's FORGE was funded by the U.S. Office on Violence Against Women to address a deficit in training and resources on transgender issues, especially the aftereffects of trauma and violence directed toward transgender individuals. FORGE created Transgender Aging Network to connect researchers, service providers, and others to transgender aging-specific topics."

We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized crossover trial in 22 private general practitioner clinics in Singapore, from November 2017 to July 2018. We included all patients aged 65 years or older. Clinics were assigned to a 3-month intervention (flyers and posters encouraging vaccination) plus 1-month washout period, and a 4-month control period (usual care). Primary outcomes were differences in vaccination uptake rates between periods. Secondary outcomes were identification of other factors associated with vaccination uptake. Results. A total of 4378 and 4459 patients were included in the intervention and control periods, respectively. Both influenza (5.9% vs 4.8%; P = .047) and pneumococcal (5.7% vs 3.7%; P = .001) vaccination uptake rates were higher during the intervention period compared with the control period. On multilevel logistic regression analysis, follow-up for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or any combination of the 3 was associated with uptake of both vaccines. Conclusions. Point-of-care informational interventions likely contributed to increased influenza and pneumococcal vaccination uptake. Patients on follow-up for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or any combination of the 3 were more likely to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and should be actively engaged by physicians."
"Education, Special"	"Although social skills training for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often addresses deficits in social communication, restricted and repetitive social behaviors are less frequently targeted in the literature. The present study evaluated a manualized social skills training program, modified to incorporate lag schedules of reinforcement, to promote appropriate and variable responding in three children in a school setting. Participants attended social skills once weekly, with probes of social skills taking place daily. A multiple baseline design across target skills was used to determine intervention efficacy. Results of the study indicated that the social skills curriculum incorporating lag schedules of reinforcement resulted in substantial increases in the number of appropriate and variable responses demonstrated by participants during each probe session, as well as the number of appropriate and variable responses demonstrated overall."
Substance Abuse	"Purpose: In response to the opioid epidemic and efforts to expand substance use education in medical school, the authors introduced opioid overdose prevention training (OOPT) with naloxone for all first-year medical students (MS1s) as an adjunct to required basic life support training (BLST). The authors previously demonstrated improved knowledge and preparedness following in-person OOPT with BLST; however, it remains unclear whether online-administered OOPT would produce comparable results. In this study, the authors perform a retrospective comparison of online-administered OOPT with in-person-administered OOPT. Objectives: To compare the educational outcomes: knowledge, preparedness, and attitudes, for online versus in-person OOPT. Methods: In-person OOPT was administered in 2014 and 2015 during BLST, whereas online OOPT was administered in 2016 during BLST pre-work. MS1s completed pre- and post-training tests covering 3 measures: knowledge (11-point scale), attitudes (66-point scale), and preparedness (60-point scale) to respond to an opioid overdose. Online scores from 2016 and in-person scores from 2015 were compared across all 3 measures using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods. Results: After controlling for pre-test scores, there were statistical, but no meaningful, differences across all measures for in-person- and online-administered training. The estimated differences were knowledge: ?0.05 (0.5%) points (95% confidence interval [CI]: ?0.47, 0.36); attitudes: 0.65 (1.0%) points (95% CI: ?0.22, 1.51); and preparedness: 2.16 (3.6%) points (95% CI: 1.04, 3.28). Conclusions: The educational outcomes of online-administered OOPT compared with in-person-administered OOPT were not meaningfully different. These results support the use of online-administered OOPT. As our study was retrospective, based on data collected over multiple years, further investigation is needed in a randomized controlled setting, to better understand the educational differences of in-person and online training. Further expanding OOPT to populations beyond medical students would further improve generalizability."
"Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods"	A pair of municipalities may consolidate services if they are contiguous. Traditional estimation methods assume that each voting process is independent. Instead we propose a new estimation procedure that allows the probability of consolidation to be influenced by neighbouring decisions. We extend a model of local interaction by allowing consolidation effort of neighbours to be either strategic substitutes or strategic complements. We disentangle direct effects arising from a change in one's own characteristics from indirect or spillover effects associated with a change in the other municipalities' characteristics. Results reveal that the endogenous peer effect coming from neighbours is a primary determinant of willingness to consolidate.
Family Studies	"This study examined the effects of destructive and constructive interparental conflict on unsupportive parental emotion socialization behaviors (N = 166 parents of toddlers). Both mothers and fathers completed measures of destructive and constructive interparental conflict and emotion dismissing beliefs and unsupportive responses to toddlers' expressions of negative emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness. Multilevel modeling for the actor-partner interdependence model indicated spillover effect of destructive conflict and crossover effects of constructive conflict on unsupportive parental emotion socialization. In short, mothers' and fathers' perceptions of destructive interparental conflict were positively related to their own use of unsupportive emotional socialization behaviors. Mothers' and fathers' perceptions of constructive interparental conflict were (marginally/trend level) negatively related to the other parent's use of unsupportive emotion socialization behaviors. These findings advance the literature on the associations between interparental conflict and parental emotion socialization, examining interdependence between mothers and fathers."
Sociology	"This paper assesses the extent of the convergence of public policies purporting to combat racial discriminations in Europe by focusing on the cases of France, the UK and Spain. It shows that the influence of 'national models' remains powerful even when the implementation of a common policy instrument such as a European directive is at stake-in this instance the Racial Equality Directive of 29 June, 2000. Having outlined the reasons for focusing on this directive, we propose a synthesis of sociological and political science studies on the subject and present our comparative methodological approach in detail. We focus on the language employed to present the discrimination problem in all three countries under study. We first examine the French case and retrace the progressive evolution of the rhetoric used, from an emphasis on the fight against racism to equal opportunities and the promotion of diversity. Having thus observed the medium-term impact of national socio-political dynamics on a European frame of reference for action, we introduce a comparison with Spain and the UK, relying on documents produced by European institutions."
Economics	"This study develops a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) laboratory for policy-relevant applications in China. The Chinese IELab features unique flexibility and advances the previous state of the art in terms of three novel aspects. First, it can generate regionally and sectorally very detailed MRIO tables based on users' own research questions. Second, it covers the entire territorial economic boundary and has the longest and most up to date annual time series from 1978 to 2015. Third, it can be used to provide insight to a wide range of research and policy questions including social, economic, and environmental issues, thus significantly improving all applications that rely on input-output tables. These features are illustrated by generating a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei multi-regional supply and use table for 2014 at city level and applying it to the case study of transferring Beijing's non-capital functions according to The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Strategy set by the Chinese government."
Women'S Studies	"Nineteenth-century imperialist discourses constructed European colonisation of indigenous inhabitants as an inevitable and necessary process for the progress of the colonies and the extension of the British Empire. Within this construct, imperialist and patriarchal discourses intersected to construct 'white women' in a manner that denied them legitimacy as autonomous individuals but simultaneously positioned them as actors within the imperial endeavour. Recent feminist scholarship has extended this historiography by considering how some women in nineteenth-century New Zealand were complexly positioned as both agents and critics of colonisation, involved in imperial strategies and yet disruptive of practices of cultural assimilation of Maori. This article furthers this scholarship through an illustrative case study of one woman who embodied this complex positioning within patriarchal and imperialist discourses. English-born wife of the first Chief Justice of New Zealand, and outspoken critic of colonial policies associated with government appropriation of Maori land, Mary Ann Martin was actively involved in establishing Anglican training institutions for young Maori men and women, and in dispensing medical assistance to Maori. Examination of her positioning on the margins of imperial discourses offers an opportunity to consider the operation of colonialism as a discourse implicated by gendered, racialised identities. Detailed textual analyses of selected extracts of her reminiscences of her 34-year residence in New Zealand, which focus on her positioning as a member of the 'inferior' sex in the dominant race, offer an opportunity to examine the ways in which she simultaneously challenged and reinforced Victorian prescriptions of respectable womanhood; how her views on and interactions with Maori may have destabilised accepted notions of women's appropriate spheres of influence; and the extent to which her challenges to dominant views on race relations may have been inflected by her positioning within gendered discourses of femininity."
Environmental Studies	Electricity market designs that decentralize decision making for participants can lead to inefficiencies in the presence of nonconvexity or missing markets. This has been shown in the case of unit-commitment problems that can make a decentralized market equilibrium less efficient than a centrally planned solution. Less attention has been focused on systems with large amounts of hydro-electric generation. We describe the results of an empirical study of the New Zealand wholesale electricity market that attempts to quantify production efficiency losses by comparing market outcomes with a counterfactual central plan.
